There are Word templates for each type of content. Instructions are formatted in red surrounded by square brackets as in the following example:`[Text in red]`. Delete these instructions when you finalize the document. The text that's highlighted in yellow must be replaced or adjusted by you. Don't change the text that's not highlighted in yellow and not formatted in red. These standard phrases help users recognize the template so that they can scan and find the content they are looking for more easily.
