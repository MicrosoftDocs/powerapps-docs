> [!TIP]
> Use the [Power CAT Toolkit](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/microsoftpowercatarch.powercattools?tab=Overview) to perform code reviews. The toolkit incorporates many of the coding guidelines from this documentation, ensuring that your solutions are efficient and maintainable. The toolkit automatically flags any patterns that don't adhere to these best practices, so you can address potential issues early in the development process. This proactive approach enhances the quality of your code and helps streamline the review process, making it easier to maintain high standards across your projects. Integrating the Power CAT Toolkit into your development workflow ensures that your solutions are built on a solid foundation and leads to more reliable and scalable solutions.
