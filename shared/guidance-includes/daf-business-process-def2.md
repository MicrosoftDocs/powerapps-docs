Business processes are particular to solutions that include Dynamics 365. We believe this new content type creates a structure that helps customers and partners be better prepared to adopt Dynamics 365. Each business process includes a diagram of a standard business process flow. Sections of the document outline configuration steps and the data entities used in each one. Each step links to the relevant page in the product documentation, and all documents have links to next steps and related resources to help readers along their learning journey.
