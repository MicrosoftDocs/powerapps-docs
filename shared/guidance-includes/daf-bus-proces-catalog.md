The catalog defines four levels of content:

1. End-to-end processes

    We've identified 15 end-to-end scenarios. We describe the scenarios in business terms, not in terms of software technology.

    For each end-to-end process, the introductory article describes how we think about the end-to-end process. We list the key stakeholders and how Dynamics 365 helps the end-to-end process. We also provide an overview, along with a business process flow diagram, of how the end-to-end process interacts with other end-to-end processes. The introduction lists the prerequisites for implementing a solution to support the end-to-end process.

2. Business process areas

    Each end-to-end scenario covers two or more business process areas. This level is just a way to group the business processes for easier searching and navigation. In most cases, the business process areas are separated by major job functions or departments in an organization. Currently, the catalog defines more than 90 business process areas.

3. Business processes

    [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-def](daf-business-process-def.md)] Each business process describes a function or process that Dynamics 365 supports. So far, we've identified nearly 700 business processes. Some apply to a single Dynamics 365 app, and the documentation for the app might already describe the process. By collecting all business processes here in the guide, we hope to provide a single entry point with links to relevant product-specific content.

4. Patterns

    In Dynamics 365, patterns are repeatable configurations that support a specific business process. They include the most common use cases, scenarios, and industries. Often, there are many ways to implement Dynamics 365 to meet your business requirements. Our goal with patterns is to provide a baseline for your implementation. We've identified more than 2000 patterns, and we expect that number to grow significantly over time.
