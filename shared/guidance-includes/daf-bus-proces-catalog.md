The catalog defines six levels of content:

1. End-to-end processes

    An end-to-end process represents the complete flow of activities from the initial trigger to the final outcome. It encompasses all the intermediate steps and subprocesses that are necessary to achieve the business objective. We've identified 15 end-to-end scenarios. We describe the scenarios in business terms, not in terms of software technology.

    For each end-to-end process, the introductory article describes how we think about the end-to-end process. We list the key stakeholders and how Dynamics 365 helps the end-to-end process. We also provide an overview, along with a business process flow diagram, of how the end-to-end process interacts with other end-to-end processes. The introduction lists the prerequisites for implementing a solution to support the end-to-end process.

1. Business process areas

    Each end-to-end scenario covers two or more business process areas. This level represents a significant grouping of related activities that contribute to the overall objective, and it provides a logical way to group business processes. In most cases, the business process areas are separated by major job functions or departments in an organization. Currently, the catalog defines more than 100 business process areas.

1. Business processes

    [!INCLUDE [daf-business-process-def](daf-business-process-def.md)] Each business process describes a function or process that Dynamics 365 supports. So far, we've identified more than 800 business processes. Some apply to a single Dynamics 365 app, and the documentation for the app might already describe the process. By collecting all business processes here in the guide, we hope to provide a single entry point with links to relevant product-specific content.

1. Scenarios

    In Dynamics 365, scenarios are patterns of repeatable configurations that support a specific business process. They include the most common use cases, scenarios, and industries. Often, there are many ways to implement Dynamics 365 to meet your business requirements. Our goal with patterns is to provide a baseline for your implementation. We've identified more than 3000 scenarios and patterns, and we expect that number to grow over time.

1. System processes

    A system process is a portion of a business process that uses a specific form, page, or UI element in Dynamics 365.

1. Test cases

A test case is a detailed set of conditions and steps used to determine whether a software application or system functions correctly. It is an essential part of the software testing process, designed to ensure that the software meets its requirements and performs as expected. Test cases are used to identify defects, ensure quality, and verify that the software behaves as intended under various conditions.
