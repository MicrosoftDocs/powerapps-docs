If timeline highlights are enabled on your app, Copilot creates an AI-generated, bulleted list that populates at the top of the timeline. You can use timeline highlights to quickly get caught up on a record's status. 

The highlights include a record's main activities, such as details about who you or the previous user interacted with, the reported issue, and actions taken to try to resolve the issue. 

You can copy the timeline highlights by selecting **Copy**.
