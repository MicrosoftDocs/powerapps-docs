The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives significant rights to individuals regarding their data. Refer to the Microsoft Learn [General Data Protection Regulation Summary](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) for an overview of GDPR, including terminology, an action plan, and readiness checklists to help you meet your obligations under GDPR when using Microsoft products and services.

You can learn more about GDPR and how Microsoft helps support it and our customers who are affected by it.

- The [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/gdpr-overview) provides general information, compliance best practices, and documentation helpful to GDPR accountability, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments, Data Subject Requests, and data breach notification.
- The [Service Trust portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRGetStarted) provides information about how Microsoft services help support compliance with GDPR.
