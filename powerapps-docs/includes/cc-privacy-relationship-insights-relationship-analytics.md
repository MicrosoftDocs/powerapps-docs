By enabling Relationship Analytics, a Embedded intelligence feature,              [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] customer data, including user identifiable information, will be sent to and stored in              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)], a service running in Azure, for the purposes of computing relationship KPIs between              [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] users and customers. The data will also be temporarily stored in              [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_service_fabric](pn-azure-service-fabric.md)] and processed for additional output, such as relationship health and trends, and then that information is returned to              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_short](pn-customer-insights-short.md)], and subsequently to              [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)].  
  
 An administrator can enable the Relationship Analytics feature by installing it as a solution in the              [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization. In addition, an administrator can subsequently disable the feature by uninstalling this solution from the              [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](pn-microsoftcrm.md)] organization.  
  
 By enabling              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] data as a data source, you will be sending              [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] customer data, including end-user identifiable information, from              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)] to              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](pn-exchange-online.md)] for purposes of gathering additional data, which will be used for KPI computations and to create other analytics.  In order to fully enable this feature, you will be required to have the              [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](pn-office-365.md)][!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] administrator also agree to a separate consent statement in the              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] application.  Once both administrators have provided consent through the applicable products,              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] will provide email and meeting metadata, which will be stored in              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)] and used for the purposes of improving KPI computations and potentially other analytics as decided by the              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)] administrator. Disabling the              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] data as a data source in the Relationship Analytics configuration will not remove              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] data from              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)].  Removal of              [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] data in              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)] can ONLY be accomplished directly from              [!INCLUDE[pn_customerinsight_full](pn-customer-insights-full.md)].
