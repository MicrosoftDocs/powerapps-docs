Microsoft Social Engagement stores customer search configurations and data curations in tenant-separated databases (customer data). The customer data is then cached on the server side in an internal application, to allow common retrieval indexing for the sole purpose of maximizing solution performance.   
 Access to index cached data (customer data) is handled exclusively by the internal application, and does not allow users to access or modify index cached data interactively in the internal application. After a subscription license agreement is terminated, customer index cached data is removed after a period of 180 days, according to our data retention policies.
