|**Access Teams**|Create team templates for this table. |
|**Allow quick create**|After you have created and published a **Quick Create Form** for this table, people will have the option to create a new record using the **Create** button in the navigation pane.

However, because activities don’t support quick create forms, the main form will be used when the custom table icon is clicked.|
|**Areas that display this entity**|In the web application choose one of the available sitemap areas to display this table. This does not apply to model-driven apps.|
|**Auditing**|When auditing is enabled for your organization, this allows for changes to table records to be captured over time. When you enable auditing for an table, auditing is also enabled on all its fields. You can select or clear fields that you want to enable auditing on.|

|**Enable for mobile**|Make this table available to the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets apps.

You can choose whether to display data in this field as the image for the record by setting this field to **[None]** or **Default Image**.<br /><br /> For custom entities you must first create an image field. Each table can have only one image field. After you create one, you can change this setting to set the primary image.
