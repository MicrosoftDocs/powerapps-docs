|Option   |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Access Teams**|Create team templates for this table. |
|**Allow quick create**|After you create and publish a **Quick Create Form** for this table, people can create a new record using the **Create** button in the navigation pane. More information: [Create and design forms](../maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms.md)<br /><br /> When quick create is enabled for a custom activity table, the custom activity is visible in the group of activity tables when people use the **Create** button in the navigation pane. However, because activities don't support quick create forms, the main form is used when the custom table icon is clicked.|
|**Areas that display this table**|In the web application, choose one of the available sitemap areas to display this table. This setting doesn't apply to model-driven apps.|
|**Auditing**|When auditing is enabled for your organization. Auditing allows for changes to table records to be captured over time. When you enable auditing for a table, auditing is also enabled on all its fields. You can select or clear fields that you want to enable auditing on.|
|**Change Tracking**|Enables data synchronization in a performant way by detecting what data changed since the data was initially extracted or last synchronized.  |
|**Color**|Set a color to be used for the table in model-driven apps.|
|**Description**|Provide a meaningful description of the purpose of the table.|
|**Document management**|After other tasks are performed to enable document management for your organization, enabling this feature allows for this table to participate in integration with SharePoint. |
|**Duplicate Detection**|If duplicate detection is enabled for your organization, enabling duplicate detection allows you to create duplicate detection rules for this table.|
|**Enable for mobile**|Make this table available to the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets apps. You can also make this table **Read-only in mobile**.<br /><br /> If the forms for a table require an extension not supported in Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets apps, use this setting to ensure that mobile app users can't edit the data for these tables.|
|**Enable for phone express**|Make this table available to the Dynamics 365 for phones app.|
|**Mail merge**|People can use this table with mail merge.|
|**Offline capability for Dynamics 365 for Outlook**|Whether data in this table is available while the Dynamics 365 for Outlook application isn't connected to the network.|
|**Primary Image**|System tables that support images already have an **Image** field. You can choose whether to display data in this field as the image for the record by setting this field to **[None]** or **Default Image**.<br /><br /> For custom tables, you must first create an image field. After you create one, you can change this setting to set the primary image. More information: [Image columns](../maker/data-platform/types-of-fields.md#image-columns) |
