If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online), exporting data to a *static* worksheet creates a local copy of the exported data and stores it on your computer. The data is transferred from Dynamics 365 (online) to your computer by using a secure connection, and no connection is maintained between this local copy and Dynamics 365 (online).  
  
 When you export to a *dynamic* worksheet or PivotTable, a link is maintained between the Excel worksheet and Dynamics 365 (online). Every time a dynamic worksheet or PivotTable is refreshed, you’ll be authenticated with Dynamics 365 (online) using your credentials. You’ll be able to see the data that you have permissions to view.  
  
 An administrator determines whether or not an organization’s users are permitted to export data to Excel by using security roles.
