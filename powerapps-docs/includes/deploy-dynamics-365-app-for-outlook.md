# Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook
People can use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] to tap the power of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] while using  [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] on the desktop, web, or tablet. For example, view information about email or appointment recipients, or link an [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email or appointment  to a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] record such as an opportunity, account, or case. To learn more about what [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] offers, see the [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User's Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=613099).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] isn’t the same thing as [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. As of the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_both](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-both.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] paired with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] is the preferred way to integrate [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] with   [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. **Note that tracking activities is not supported when  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] are used together by the same user.** For information on the  [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] add-in, see the [Dynamics 365 for Outlook User’s Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=524751).

## Deploy Dynamics 365 App for Outlook  
 After setting up [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] and setting the required privileges, you can push [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)] to some or all users, or you can have users install it themselves as needed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you're on [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_op](../includes/pn-dyn-365-op.md)], see the section below:  [To deploy to Dynamics 365 on-premises users](#BKMK_DeployOnprem)  
  
#### To push the app to users  
  
1.  Go to **Settings** >  **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook**.  
  
2.  In the **Getting Started with Dynamics 365 App for Outlook** screen, under **Add for Eligible Users** (you may have to click **Settings** if you’re opening this screen for the second or subsequent time), select the **Automatically add the app to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]** check box if you want to have users get the app automatically. If a user has the required privileges and email is synchronized through [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)], you won’t have to do anything more to push the app to them. For example, if you add the required privileges to the Salesperson role, and then assign this role to a new user, they’ll automatically get the app.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To push the app to all eligible users, click **Add App for All Eligible Users**.  
  
    -   To push the app to certain users, select those users in the list, and then click **Add App to Outlook**.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  If the list shows that a user is pending or hasn’t been added, you can click the **Learn more** link next to the user to find more information about status.  
  
4.  When you’re done, click **Save**.  
  
#### To have users install the app themselves  
  
1.  Users click the **Settings** button ![Settings button](media/mp-ua-r16-settings.png "Settings button"), and then click **Apps for Dynamics 365**.  
  
2.  In the **Apps for Dynamics 365** screen, under **[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)]**, users click **Add app to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Users can also disable or remove the add-in themselves, if needed. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook User’s Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=613099).  
  
<a name="BKMK_DeployOnprem"></a>   
## To deploy to Dynamics 365 on-premises users  
 Follow these steps if you're using Dynamics 365 on-premises.  
  
-   Configure your Dynamics 365 server for Internet-facing deployment. See [Configure IFD for Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn609803.aspx).  
  
-   If you're connecting to Exchange on-premises, configure the OAuth provider and register client apps. See [Configure Windows Server 2012 R2 for Dynamics 365 applications that use OAuth](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh699726.aspx).  
  
<a name="BKMK_Troubleshoot"></a>   
## Troubleshooting installation problems  
 If you or your users have trouble installing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], it may be because their [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox is currently linked to another [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] organization. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox (email address) can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one organization, and a user that belongs to that organization can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] mailbox.  You can overwrite the setting stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] if you want to change the primary synchronizing organization. For more information, see [this KB article.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3211627/incomingemailrejected-error-when-attempting-to-install-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook)
