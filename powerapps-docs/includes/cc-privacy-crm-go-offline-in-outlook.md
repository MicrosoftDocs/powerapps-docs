If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook, when you go offline, a copy of the data you are working on is created and stored on your local computer. The data is transferred from Dynamics 365 (online) to your computer by using a secure connection, and a link is maintained between the local copy and Dynamics 365 Online. The next time you sign in to Dynamics 365 (online), the local data will be synchronized with Dynamics 365 (online).  
  
 An administrator determines whether or not an organizationâ€™s users are permitted to go offline with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook by using security roles.  
  
 Users and administrators can configure which entities are downloaded via Offline Sync by using the **Sync Filters** setting in the **Options** dialog box. Alternatively, users and Administrators can configure which fields are downloaded (and uploaded) by using **Advanced Options** in the **Sync Filters** dialog box.
