When used with a data source, this function can't be delegated. Only the first portion of the data source will be retrieved and then the function applied. The result may not represent the complete story.  A warning may appear at authoring time to remind you of this limitation and to suggest switching to delegable alternatives where possible. For more information, see the [delegation overview](../maker/canvas-apps/delegation-overview.md).
