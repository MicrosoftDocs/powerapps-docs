If you use Microsoft Dynamics 365, the Bing Maps feature automatically sends the address over the Internet to the Bing Maps service to display an online map of the address within Dynamics 365.  If you click on the Bing Maps within Dynamics 365, you will be redirected to [www.bing.com/maps](https://www.bing.com/maps). Your use of Bing Maps is also governed by the [Bing Maps End User Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9710837).  
  
 Your administrator can turn the Bing Maps feature on or off in the **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** area. Turning the Bing Maps app off disables the feature within Dynamics 365.
