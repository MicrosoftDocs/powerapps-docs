> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Effective August 29, 2025, Cards for Power Apps will be deprecated and no longer supported. As a result, any Cards for Power Apps that have been built and shared in Microsoft Teams will not function. Users will not be able to create new cards or execute existing ones.
> 
>We recommend migrating any functionality you rely on from Cards for Power Apps before the deprecation date. Consider transitioning to either [Adaptive Cards in Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/adaptive-cards-overview) or [adaptive cards for Microsoft Teams](/power-automate/overview-adaptive-cards) for similar functionality.
