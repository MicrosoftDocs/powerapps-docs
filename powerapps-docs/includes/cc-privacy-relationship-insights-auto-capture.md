By enabling the Auto Capture feature, [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] data is retrieved by [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)], but not stored, to show email activity to the signed-in user. Users can explicitly 'track' these emails to copy [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](pn-exchange.md)] emails into [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] as an Email Activity, to be shared with the appropriate users as configured by [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] permissions.  
  
 An administrator enables and disables the Auto Capture feature by navigating to **Settings** > **Intelligence Configuration**, clicking the **Auto Capture** tab, and then making the appropriate selection. A user can also disable the Auto Capture feature on the Email tab within **Personal Options**, by changing **Show email not tracked in Dynamics 365 in the Activities list** to **No**.
