By enabling the **User Content and Location** setting, you allow your [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](pn-microsoftcrm.md)] or Microsoft Dynamics CRM administrator and system customizers to access precise location data and files on your mobile device. The administrator or customizer may choose to send the information to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)], Dynamics CRM, and/or other services at their discretion. You can subsequently disable this functionality by disabling the **User Content and Location** setting. Note that this setting does not impact the privacy settings specified in the mobile device operating system.
