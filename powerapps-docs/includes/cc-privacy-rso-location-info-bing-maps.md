By enabling Resource Schedule Optimization, information, including schedule configuration information and work order details (location-relevant address information, such as account address and resource address) will be sent from [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](pn-bing-maps.md)] to allow for:  
  
-   Determining the geo location (latitude, longitude) of a specific address.  
  
-   Calculating the distance and travel time between locations.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](pn-bing-maps.md)] then returns the information to [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)].  An administrator can subsequently disable Resource Schedule Optimization to prevent address information from being sent to [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](pn-bing-maps.md)].
