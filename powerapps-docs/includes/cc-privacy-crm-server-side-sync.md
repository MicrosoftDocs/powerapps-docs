If you use Dynamics 365, when you use server-side sync, Dynamics 365 contacts and activities (including emails, appointments, contacts, and tasks) are synchronized to your specified email system (such as Exchange).  
  
 An administrator can configure server-side sync functionality to specify which users have the ability to send emails or appointments from Dynamics 365 or synchronize activities and contacts between Dynamics 365 and the userâ€™s mailbox. Both the administrator and end users can further customize filter criteria, and administrators can even define which entity fields synchronize.
