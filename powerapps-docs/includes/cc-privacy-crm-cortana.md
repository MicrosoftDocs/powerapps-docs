Cortana does not have access to the data stored in the Dynamics 365 database. Cortana only captures your voice commands. When you make a voice command through Cortana, in order to both understand the request and improve Microsoft speech recognition-related products and services, Microsoft uses proprietary technologies such as, for example, acoustic and natural language processing models to record and interpret your user’s request. Voice-dictated Bing search queries are treated like other text-based search requests and may be used to improve Bing search results; however, the Dynamics 365-voice-dictated commands listed here are not used to provide advertising. For more information about privacy and Cortana, see [Cortana and my privacy FAQ](https://www.windowsphone.com/how-to/wp8/cortana/cortana-and-my-privacy-faq).  
  
 If you are an administrator, you can manage enterprise access to Cortana with the PolicyManager configuration service provider through a separate device management service. The policy for this is set at the phone level and can’t be set just for the Dynamics 365 for phones app. For more information, see the MSDN topic [PolicyManager configuration service provider](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-phone/dn499739(v=technet.10)).
