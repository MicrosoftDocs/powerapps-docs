> - Marketing pages created and hosted by Dynamics 365 for Marketing use cookies to enable the pre-fill feature for known contacts, and to log when any contact opens a marketing page. Dynamics 365 marketing pages and page templates do not include a cookie-consent feature, so you must add it. One way to do this is by adding JavaScript to the <head> section of your pages using the HTML editor of the page designer. You could develop your own JavaScript or use one of the many free or licensed solutions already available. You could also use the built-in privacy statement for marketing pages to announce your use of cookies; however, this might not be sufficient in all jurisdictions because it won't stop the server from setting the cookie&mdash;it just informs visitors that cookies are being used (for more information about this feature, see [Configure marketing pages](../marketing/marketing-settings.md#config-mkt-pages)).

> - The _websites_ feature uses cookies to log visits to any web page where you place the tracking script. Cookies work together with the marketing-pages feature to identify contacts by matching the visitor IDs to landing-page submissions. If your website already uses cookies and includes a consent feature, then it probably covers the Dynamics 365 for Marketing website script. However, if you don't have cookie consent built into your website, you must add it before adding the website script to pages that market to residents of relevant countries/regions.
