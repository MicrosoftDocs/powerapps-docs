By enabling the Relationship Assistant feature, limited exchange data, which includes a sender's name and email address as well as excerpts of the email body, are retrieved (but are not stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)]), for the purpose of showing relevant insights of your email. Further, the Relationship Assistant feature can be configured to retrieve information with regards to news, financials, and flight information,  by sending out requests to external components such as MSN Money and Bing (which are not considered [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_365](pn-ms-dyn-365.md)] Core Services). An administrator can enable and disable the Relationship Assistant feature by navigating to **Settings** > **Intelligence Configuration**, clicking the **Relationship Assistant** tab, and then making the appropriate selection.  
  
 The external components involved with Relationship Assistant functionality are detailed in the following sections.

 **[!INCLUDE[pn_ms_MSN_Money](pn-ms-msn-money.md)]**  
  
 Relationship Assistant uses [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_MSN_Money](pn-ms-msn-money.md)] to show relevant stock information to a user by using the account ticker symbol from that user’s [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](pn-dynamics-crm.md)] data.
