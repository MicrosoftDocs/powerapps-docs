Marketing Pages are further sent to a customer's own instance of Portal capabilities for [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)].

To personalize sent emails [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] needs to enable data flow to and from [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)]. Please see below for more information about the [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)] service. Data flow to [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)] includes synchronization of contacts and accounts to [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)].

To recalculate lead score models and marketing segments, [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] needs to send lead score model definitions and segment definitions to [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)] and to leverage profiles and interactions in [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)] within these calculations.

To provide insights into the email and Internet interactions captured by [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services, the collected data flows from [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-app-module](../includes/pn-marketing-app-module.md)] services to both [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)].

Data flow involving [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)] is the following:
- Entity data from [!INCLUDE[pn-marketing-business-app-module-name](../includes/pn-marketing-business-app-module-name.md)] to [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)], using the regular inbound connector of [!INCLUDE[pn-customer-insights-full](../includes/pn-customer-insights-full.md)], in order to provide content for email personalization, lead scoring, and segmentation (mainly contacts and accounts, eventually also leads and events)
