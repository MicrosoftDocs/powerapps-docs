Occurs after the main system operation and within the database transaction.<br /><br />Use this stage to modify any properties of the message before it is returned to the caller.<br /><br />Avoid applying changes to an entity included in the message because this will trigger a new Update event.<br /><br />Within the PostOperation stage you can register steps to use the asynchronous execution mode. These steps will run outside of the database transaction using the asynchronous service.<br /><br />You must use asynchronous mode when registering your plug-in if the plug-in is designed to perform an update operation and is registered on the Create message of the [User (SystemUser)](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/systemuser) entity. <p/>More information: [Asynchronous service](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/asynchronous-service).
