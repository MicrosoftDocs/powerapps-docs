# Conclusion

Fusion development isn't a strict methodology; rather, it's an approach and philosophy that encourage rapid software development.

Fusion development combines the technical and business skills of an organization's employees to design and build applications. This approach values the insights and abilities of different members of the team. It uses their specific insights into business requirements and the technical challenges required to implement a solution. The synergy afforded by fusion development enables efficient communication among team members as they iterate quickly to produce a functional system.<!--note from editor: Suggested.-->

In this ebook, you've seen how the staff at VanArsdel followed a fusion development approach. They produced an app that meets the expectations of the users represented by the technician Caleb, the inventory manager Maria, and Malik, who schedules the engineers. The IT Operations manager Preeti is also satisfied that the system is safe and maintainable. The project was completed in record time&mdash;from the initial discussions between Caleb and Maria to rolling the app out to all technicians.

The VanArsdel team has now experienced how fusion development teams work and is excited to keep collaborating on future projects.
