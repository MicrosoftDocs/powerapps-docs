# Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)

The first step in using Microsoft Power Platform to solve a business problem is
deciding what problem you want to tackle.

In IT terms, the business problem to solve is commonly referred to as the *use case*.

Ask yourself, "what's the business problem I'm trying to solve?" (Be concise when you name
the problem; in many cases, it will become the name of the app that you
build!) When you define the problem, break it down into a problem statement and
the result that you'd like to achieve.

For the app that we'll use as an example in these articles, we came up with
the following statement: "Expense reporting: Create a process that's efficient for
employees and the accounting department, allows faster budget tracking, and
reduces our exposure in audits."

If you already know exactly what problem you've set out to solve, you can skip
to the section [Considering the cost of solving the problem manually](#considering-the-cost-of-solving-the-problem-manually).
If you need some ideas or want to practice on a smaller problem before you
tackle your original inspiration, read on.

## What can I do with Power Apps?

If you're making your first app with Power Apps, think about your business and the
work that you and your team do day to day, and identify a business problem that
you currently are using a manual process to solve.

Potential use cases for automation are gaps, complaints, or inefficiencies that
exist in your current work environment. Processes that still require paper or
email, and processes that require manually moving data from one place to another
(from email to a database or from one spreadsheet to another), are likely
candidates for solving with an app.

> [!TIP]
> Don't pick a problem that's so large that you'll get stuck. However, even
large processes can be automated in bite-sized portions as you break down the
entire process into manageable elements.

It's good to know how the app you have in mind might benefit your colleagues and
your boss, especially when you need to ask for cooperation when making or using
the apps. The list below shows the kinds of issues that can be solved by the
platform:

- **Availability** – Accessing apps at any time, anywhere

- **Mobility** – Allowing people to work with an app while on the move

- **Consolidation** – Gathering data in a more automated way to minimize manual
    consolidation

- **Training** – Getting people up to speed and tracking their training results and
    certifications

- **Democratization** – Enhancing the ability to self-solve problems within the
    department or section

- **Inclusion** – Reducing friction for employees who have different work
    environments from other employees (such as remote workers or people with
    disabilities)

- **Efficiency** – Reducing time required to get the desired outcome, reducing
    unnecessary steps

- **Productivity** – Increasing the throughput of a process

- **Timeliness** – Increasing the speed of end-to-end collaboration among
    different stakeholders

- **Scalability** – Allowing more throughput

- **Analysis** – Gathering required additional information, storing it in such a way
    that allows for easier analysis

- **Reporting** – Enabling faster or more complete reporting to management

- **Security** – Securely storing and working with data

- **Compliance** – Solving issues around handling personal information, meeting legal or
    accounting requirements

- **Sustainability** – Reducing waste (such as paper and electricity) and pollution

## Considering the cost of solving the problem manually

Before you embark on the project, take another moment to reflect on whether the
project is worthwhile.

It might be possible to "guesstimate" the high-level cost of solving the problem
manually. This can be expressed in the *time* it takes to complete the process end-to-end, or&mdash;if you
know a worker's "fully loaded" cost (salary or hourly rate, benefits, and so on)&mdash;
you can multiply the time spent solving the problem by that rate to get to a
*cost* each time the process is run. From there, if you know the number of times
the process is run, you can calculate the annual cost.

Be aware that not all projects result in time or cost savings. Sometimes automating
a process can provide cleaner or more timely data, or cost avoidance (for
example, capturing data allows for an audit trail that could help avoid a fine if an audit occurred.)

This will be a "back of the napkin" estimate to ensure it's worth undertaking
your app project. In another article, we'll go into detail about [analyzing cost versus business value](worth-automating-process.md).

Assuming you've decided this project is worth pursuing, the next step is to
fully understand the current process and look for optimizations you can make to
it.
