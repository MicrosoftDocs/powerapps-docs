# How does this task pass to the next task?

Now it's time to move to the next task in the process. What does that look
like?

Does it build on the data that's used by this task? Can the next task be different
depending on the data (for example, an extra layer of approval required for
expense reports over \$500)?

Is the next task performed by the same person who completed this task? Is the
next task completed by a different person? How does that person know that they
can begin the next task?

## On to the next task!

Now that this task has been inspected, continue with the next task in the
process&mdash;starting back at [What is the task?](what-is-task.md)&mdash;until you've inspected all the tasks.
