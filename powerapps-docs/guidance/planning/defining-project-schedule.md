# Defining the project schedule

You should have at least a rough idea of how much time you'll be spending on
the project. The phases should be split to:

- Plan

- Design

- Make

- Test

- Deploy and refine

Power Apps is intended for rapid development. However, many factors
affect how long it can take for an app to be completed:

- The experience level of the person making the app

- Whether you're using an existing app as a starting point for design or
    implementation (this will speed things up)

- The number of apps to be created (for example, our expense report process
    will require one app for expense report creators and another app for the
    approvers)

- The number and complexity of the features your app needs

- The type and number of data sources to connect to, and whether you need to
    collaborate with other teams to get access to the data

- The availability of project participants

As your plans and scope become more clear, you can refine your schedule
estimates.

One way to shorten development time while maintaining (and even enhancing)
quality is to [use an existing app as a template](../../maker/canvas-apps/get-started-test-drive.md). Whether you're using a template
provide with Power Apps or Power Automate, another app developed in your
organization, or an example you found elsewhere, templates and reference designs
can help with screen design, interactions, and data architecture.
