# Identifying project team members

Anyone who is involved in designing, making, and testing apps will be a
project team member.

The [list of key contributors](understanding-current-business-process.md) you made is a starting point. You might need to
add expertise to the team, whether it's someone who has experience using Power
Apps to make apps or Power Automate to make flows, or a software developer to help create
connections to existing databases.

Power Apps provides app-making capabilities for everyone, so it's
important to coordinate and collaborate for smooth
app development. (In the [making phase](making-phase.md) section, we discuss strategies for collaboration.)

Consider whether you need team members to fill the following roles.

| Team member                | Role     |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Users / subject matter experts | Provide the necessary requirements and feedback to ensure the apps meet the functionality they requested.   |
| App makers                         | Use Power Apps to make apps for users. For simple apps, the user might be the app maker. Some organizations have dedicated app makers who are experts in building apps for others.  |
| Software developers    | Provide solutions that can't be solved by using out-of-the-box features, when requirements are complex and need custom development. Developers can also create APIs and set up custom connectors to allow app makers to consume those APIs.    |
| IT administrators                  | Provide necessary resources and support to connect to internal systems in addition to enterprise systems. IT administrators ensure that environments and tenants are set up for governance and administration. Some organizations have a [Center of Excellence](/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) for scalable adoption of the platform. |
| Project manager                    | Manages the project to help ensure it stays on track for scope, budget, time, and meeting the goals you set out.      |
| Management                         | Provides sponsorship and shows support of the activities and projects related to the platform; empowers the project team members; ratifies the project objectives; communicates support to the organization to aid adoption; makes sure that accomplishments are recognized.   |

A larger project might also require a technical architect, UI design,
documentation, training, or other roles.

For a small project, one person might be the subject matter expert, manage the
project, and make the app.
