# Gaining support and sponsorship from management

To ensure your company is supportive of making your app and using it to replace
any existing business process, make sure to gain support or sponsorship from
your management. Having a sponsor for the project is key when you need to drive
behavior change in the organization, identify funding, or get access to
organizational data.

In some organizations, sponsorship allows for budget to become available to IT
to execute the project. Although IT might have a fixed budget to get work done each
fiscal year, a business unit might provide funding for the project because
of the savings that they'll realize when it's complete.

Sometimes a project can have multiple sponsors.

For our example expense report process, there are several candidates who can
serve as the sponsor. Because we've identified what the end-to-end process is
costing the organization, our sponsor coalition includes both Nick and
Charlotte. Each of their departments can realize a significant cost savings from
the project. Nick's sponsorship will ensure that employees adopt the new
process. Charlotte's sponsorship will provide some funds in addition to permission
to access key data.
