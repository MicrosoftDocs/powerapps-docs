# Planning phase

Planning is the most important part of the app-making process. When planning,
you should consider the following:

- **What problem** will the app solve?

- **Who** will use this app?

- **What goals** and objectives will it meet for users?

Knowing the answers helps you stay on track when you design the app. It's easy to fall into the trap of *making the app* as the objective, rather than
*solving the issue*.

In this section, you'll learn about:

- [Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)](identifying-business-problem-to-solve.md)

- [Deeply understanding the business process](understanding-current-business-process.md)

- [Optimizing the business process with your solution](optimizing-business-process.md)

- [Deciding whether it's worthwhile to automate the process](worth-automating-process.md)

- [Creating a project plan](defining-app-project-objective.md)
