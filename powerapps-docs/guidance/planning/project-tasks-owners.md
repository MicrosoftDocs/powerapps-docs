# Listing the project tasks and owners

Based on the five project phases (planning, designing, making, testing, and deploying and refining),
list the tasks that need to be done during each phase. Assign who will be
responsible for each task, along with the targeted date of completion.

You might want to use Microsoft Planner to manage your tasks together with your
project team.

See [Developing solutions collaboratively](making-phase.md#developing-solutions-collaboratively) for information about how to enable
multiple people to build one Power Apps project.
