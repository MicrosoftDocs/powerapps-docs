# Designing phase

Designing the app is an important part of the process, where you start to
specify what you'll be creating in the making phase based on the information
you've gathered in the planning phase.

In this phase, you'll prepare the specifications and designs of your app.

## Conceptual design

Conceptual design is about coming up with the design for the overall blueprint
of the app.

In this section, you'll consider:

- [What are the tasks involved in the app?](app-tasks.md)

- [What will the user experience be?](sketching.md)

## Architectural design

After you've completed your conceptual design, it's time to move on to the
architectural design. The architecture design specifies how you'll use Power
Apps (and other Microsoft Power Platform products) to automate your business process.

This is where you'll consider things like:

- [How to store your data](where-is-data.md)

- [How to integrate with existing systems and apps you use already](enterprise-systems.md)

- [Designing your data structure](data-modeling.md)

- [Determining which type of app to make](app-type.md)

- [Determining where to place your logic](logic.md)

- [How to secure your data](security.md)
