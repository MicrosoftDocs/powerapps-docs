# Defining the app project goals

Having a project plan ensures that you have the right resources (time, people, and
funds) and follow a consistent approach to ensure a good level of quality for
the apps you make.

Having a clear objective for what you and your project team are trying to
achieve is important so that your project team members share the same goals. Writing
down your goals is a good way to clarify what you want the app you're considering
making to achieve. It also ensures you don't lose focus on what you need to
create and what features to prioritize. (More information: [Prioritizing features and requests](prioritizing-features.md))

If you have very ambitious goals, you might want to start thinking about how to
break down the project into incremental releases. (In a later section, we'll
discuss the incremental release methodology.)

In the previous section, you created business goals for your project. You might
want to create additional goals related to the adoption, functionality, and
usability of the app and its non-financial impact on the business (such as
increasing job satisfaction).

## Example: Expense report solution goals

When we looked at the overall business goals for our solution, we decided to divide them into
releases so that we could deliver value incrementally:

**Release 1:**

- For at least 80&nbsp;percent of expense reports, expense report creators spend no more
    than 20 minutes actively working on creating reports.

- Within one month of solution availability, 100&nbsp;percent of expense reports use the
    digital system.

**Release 2:**

- For at least 90&nbsp;percent of expense reports, the time between submitting the report
    and having a payment logged in the finance system is less than three business
    days.

- By the end of the year, department managers can access a weekly budget report that's up to date for
    all expenses within one hour of their approval.

- The number of errors found in the semiannual audit is reduced by 50&nbsp;percent.

**Additional goals for release 1 of the solution:**

- 80&nbsp;percent of salespeople surveyed report being able to meet all their expense
    reporting needs by using the mobile app.

- 80&nbsp;percent of users can do their top-priority tasks in the app without any
    instruction.
