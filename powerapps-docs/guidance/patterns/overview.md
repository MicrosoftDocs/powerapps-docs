# Power Apps patterns

With Microsoft Power Platform, you can easily create apps that are tailored to your
organization's specific needs. Although your needs might be unique, we see some
common *patterns* among apps most often created by organizations to meet their
most-pressing needs.

Different scenarios, across different industries, often use the basic same
patterns. For example, an app for doing aircraft inspections, a situational awareness app for hospitals, and an app for tracking kids' reading levels all
have a similar structure, even though they have very different purposes and
audiences.

In this set of articles, we've identified some of the uses for Microsoft Power Platform
we've seen and the patterns that successful makers have used to bring these
solutions to life. Each article contains links to the real-world
customer stories that include best practices for structuring data, using the
elements of Microsoft Power Platform, and integrating into the overall business. 

In the list below, look for a scenario that's similar to what you need and then
select the pattern to learn more.

We'll continue to add patterns over time.
