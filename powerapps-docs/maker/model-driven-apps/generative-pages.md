# Describe a page using natural language (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-note-pp.md](../../../shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use natural language to create a *generative page* that's generated using AI. Generative pages are an AI-driven experience designed to simplify, accelerate, and improve your app design process in model-driven apps. By interacting with the app agent, you create fully functional pages in your model-driven apps by describing what you need in natural language and specifying which Microsoft Dataverse tables to reference. You can even attach an image of what you’d like the page to look like. 

After you describe the page, the system then processes your requirements and  specifications and intelligently generates React code that covers both the front-end user experience by selecting the right components and determining the best layout, and the corresponding business logic. Through an interactive, conversational experience, you can refine the page design in real time, adjusting elements, layout, and functionality to perfectly match your vision.

## Prerequisites

<!-- There were several requirements that appear to be for early release. What are the requirements for public preview? Do you need an of the AI/Copilot environment settings enabled-->

## Create a generative page in model-driven apps

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Open a model-driven app for editing.
1. In the app designer, select **Add a page** > **Describe a page**.

   A full-page generative page experience opens.
1. In the textbox, type a description of the type of page you want to create. The description should include functional requirements and optionally any UX specifications. For example, you could enter *Build a page showing Account records as a gallery of cards using a modern look and feel. All cards should have fixed size and tall enough to fit 4 lines of titles. Include name, entityimage on the top, and website, email, phone number. Make the component fill 100% of the space. Make the gallery scrollable by using data from the Account table*.
1. Add tables and images as appropriate by selecting **Add data** > **Add table**. You can link up to six Dataverse tables. In the screenshot, the account table is added.

1. Optionally upload an image to guide the UI of your generated page by selecting **Add data** > **Attach image**. This can be a rough napkin sketch or a higher resolution image.
1. When you're finished describing the page, press Enter or select **Generate page**.

When the agent finishes building your page, the user experience is displayed. If the user experience isn't already displayed, you can view it by selecting **Preview**.

## View the generated code, iterate, and publish

Select **Code** to view the code generated by the app agent.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can't edit the generative page code.

Refine the output by iterating on the description to fix errors, adjust layout, or add more functionality.

:::image type="content" source="media/generative-page/generative-page-view-code-iterate.png" alt-text="View generative page code and iterate on the design":::

When you're satisfied with the generated page, select **Save and Publish** to make the page available when you play the model-driven app.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, publishing must be done separately for each generative page that you want to play in the app.

<!-- ## Limitations 

What are the limitations of the generative page for public preview? -->

## Frequently asked questions
<!--Please verify whether these FAQs apply to the public preview -->
### Can I start designing my app in Plan Designer and then use generative pages? 

Yes, while there's currently no direct integration between Plan designer and generative pages, you can use Plan designer to define your tables and apps, and then switch to the app designer to create any desired generative pages.

### What kind of images work best for guiding the UI generation?

Clear sketches or wireframes—whether hand-drawn or digital—are most effective, though whiteboard or napkin drawings can also be used.

### Can I use generative pages with canvas apps or other app types?

No, generative pages are currently only supported in model-driven apps.  

### Is there a way to reuse or clone a generative page across environments?

Currently, you can't move generated pages between environments.

### Can I edit the generated code manually?

No. Code editing isn't currently supported. You can view the generated code, but any refinements must be made through the conversational interface with the app agent.
