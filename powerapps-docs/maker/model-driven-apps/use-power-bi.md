# Use Power BI

The Power BI cloud service works with Microsoft Dataverse apps to provide a self-service analytics solution. Power BI automatically refreshes the app's data displayed. With Power BI Desktop or Microsoft Excel, Power Query for authoring reports and Power BI for sharing dashboards and refreshing data from model-driven apps, your users have a powerful way to work with your app's data. For more information, see these articles:
