# Use Power BI

The Power BI cloud service works with Common Data Service apps to provide a self-service analytics solution. Power BI automatically refreshes the app's data displayed. With Power BI Desktop or Microsoft Excel, Power Query for authoring reports and Power BI for sharing dashboards and refreshing data from model-driven apps, your users have a powerful way to work with your app's data.  
  
<a name="PowerBIGetstarted"></a>   
## Get started using Power BI with model-driven apps  
 
The Dynamics 365 apps content packs for Power BI allow you to easily access and analyze your data in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).  
  
 To create a Power BI dashboard using a content pack, follow these instructions.  
  
1. If you haven't already done so, [register with Power BI](https://powerbi.com/).  
  
2. After you have signed in to Power BI, in the **Datasets** area select **Get Data**, under **Services** select **Get**, and then select from the following content packs.  
  
   - **Sales Analytics for Dynamics 365**  
  
   - **Customer Service Analytics for Dynamics 365**  
  
   - **Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Social Engagement**  
  
3. For the Sales Analytics and Service Analytics content packs, enter the URL of your instance, such as *<https://OrganizationName.crm.dynamics.com>*, where *OrganizationName* is the organization name of your instance, and select **Next**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If your data center is outside of North America the crm.dynamics.com domain name may be different, such as crm2.dynamics.com, crm3.dynamics.com, crm4.dynamics.com, etc. To find the domain name, in the apps web app go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources**. The URLs listed will indicate the correct domain name.  
  
    For the Marketing content pack, enter the URL as *<https://OrganizationName.marketing.dynamics.com/analytics>*, where *OrganizationName* is the organization name of your instance of Dynamics 365, and select **Next**  
  
4. Under **Authentication method**, select **oAuth2**.  
  
5. Your instance data is imported and several visualizations become available.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  If the content pack you select does not open in your web browser, in the left pane of your Power BI workspace click the content pack under **Dashboards**.

## Embed Power BI visualizations on personal dashboards  
 Before users can embed Power BI visualizations on personal dashboards, the organization-wide setting must be enabled.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, Power BI visualization embedding is disabled and must be enabled before users can embed them in personal dashboards.  
  
### Enable Power BI visualizations in the organization  
  
1. Sign-in to Dynamics 365 as a user with the system administrator security role.  
  
2. Go to **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings**.  
  
3. On the **Reporting** tab in the **Allow Power BI visualization embedding** option, select **Yes** to enable or **No** to disable.  
  
4. Select **OK**.

## Use Power BI Desktop to connect directly to your instance  
 You can connect to your instance with Power BI Desktop to create custom reports and dashboards for use with the Power BI service.  
  
### Requirements  
  
- Power BI service registration
