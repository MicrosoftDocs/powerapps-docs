# Configure a lookup component on a form  

Lookups help a user choose records from a **related** table. A lookup component is automatically added when a lookup column is added to a form.

For example, using a lookup component, you can open an account record that relates to a sales invoice record.

## Configure a lookup component

Makers configure a lookup component using the form designer.

These are the properties available to configure when using a lookup component on a form using the form designer.

|Area  |Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Display options** | **Label** |  The label text that is displayed next to the lookup column. |
| **Display options**   | **Hide label**  | When enabled, the label isn’t displayed.  |
| **Display options**   | **Hide on phone**  | When enabled, the lookup column won’t display when running the app on a phone.  |
| **Display options**   | **Hide**  | Don’t display the lookup column. The lookup column can then be displayed using code.  |
| **Display options**   | **Lock**  | Make this column so that it can’t be removed by you or other makers until the **Lock** property is disabled.  |
| **Display options**   | **Read-only**  | When this property is enabled, users can’t change the value in the lookup column.  |
| **Display options**   | **Disable most recently used items**  | Disabling this option allows users to view recently used rows in the lookup dropdown list. Enabling this option disables the recent items.   |
| **Display options**   | **Use Main Form Dialog for Create**  | Enabling this option allows users to create rows in a pop out dialog for this lookup field, instead of closing the current form and navigating away.  |
| **Display options**   | **Use Main Form Dialog for Edit**  | Enabling this option allows users to edit rows in a pop out dialog for this lookup field, instead of closing the current form and navigating away.   |
| **Display options** | **Default view** |  The view of the table selected in the **Table** property that can be used to get and display the list of rows that app users can select in the lookup drop-down list. |
| **Display options** | **Allow users to change view** |  When selected, app users can change from the **Default view** to another view of the table. |
| **Display options** | **Show all views** |  When selected, app users can change from the **Default view** to all other views of the table selected in the **Table** property. <br /><br />This property is only available when **Allow users to change view** is selected. |
| **Display options** | **Selected views** |  A list of views of the table selected in the **Table** property that app users can change to from the **Default view**. <br /><br />This property is only available when **Allow users to change view** is selected and **Show all views** is unselected. |
| **Formatting**  | **Form field width**  | Determines the width in number of columns for the lookup column.  |
| **Filtering**  | **Filter by related rows**  | When this is enabled, you can filter this lookup based on a row related to both the current table and this lookup. The rows that display in this lookup when users search for a row will then have additional filtering applied. This helps provide more relevant searches when setting the value of the lookup. <br /><br />By default, this is turned off.  |
| **Filtering**  | **Relationship to current table** | This dropdown list defines the relationship from the table of the related row you want to filter by to the target lookup's table. <br /><br />The possible relationship combinations will be listed in the table following this one.  |
| **Filtering**  | **Relationship to this lookup’s table**  | This dropdown list defines the relationship from the table of the related row you want to filter by to the target lookup's table. <br /><br />For the possible relationship combinations, go to [Table relationships available for a lookup column](#possible-relationship-combinations-for-a-lookup-column).   |
| **Filtering**  | **Allow users to turn off filter**  | When this is enabled, users will have the option to turn off the filter you define here.  |
| **Components**  | **+Component** | Configure a control for the lookup column, such as the form component control.  |
