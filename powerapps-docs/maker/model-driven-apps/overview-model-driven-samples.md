# Model-driven sample apps

In [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.com), use a sample app to explore design possibilities and discover concepts that you can apply as you develop your own apps. Each sample app uses fictitious data to showcase a real-world scenario. 

Be sure to check out documentation specific to each sample app for more details.

## Get sample apps

In order to play or edit model-driven sample apps, the apps must first be provisioned in a Common Data Service database. First create a trial environment and database and be sure to select **Deploy sample apps and data**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option installs all available sample apps in your database. Sample apps are for educational and demonstration purposes and we do not recommend installing them in production databases. 

## Customize a sample app

1. Sign in to [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.com)  

2. From the **Create** page, select the sample app and click **Create**.

3. The App designer will open providing multiple options for customizing the app.

4. For additional customization options, click **Advanced** from the left navigation in the portal.

## Remove sample apps and data 
- Deleting a sample app requires deleting the corresponding  [managed solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/uninstall-delete-solution). 
- Deleting the solution also deletes any sample data specific to the custom entities for the app.
- If customizations were made to the sample app, there may be [dependencies](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/dependency-tracking-solution-components), which must be removed before deleting the solution.

### Delete a solution
To delete a solution, follow the steps in this topic: [Delete a model-driven app](delete-model-driven-app.md#delete-a-model-driven-app-that-was-installed-as-part-of-a-managed-solution)
