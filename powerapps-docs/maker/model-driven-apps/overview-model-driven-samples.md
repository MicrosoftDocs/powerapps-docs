# Model-driven sample apps

In [powerapps.com](https://powerapps.com), use a sample app to explore design possibilities and discover concepts that you can apply as you develop your own apps. Each sample app uses fictitious data to showcase a real-world scenario. 

<!-- Be sure to check out documentation specific to each sample app for more details. -->

## Get sample apps

The availability of sample apps depends on how an environment database was provisioned.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to play or edit model-driven sample apps, the apps must first be provisioned in a Microsoft Dataverse database by an administrator that has the Environment Admin role. 

To install the sample apps and data, create a trial environment and database, and then be sure to select **Deploy sample apps and data**.

<img src = "media/overview-model-driven-samples/create-database1.png" alt = "Deploy sample apps and data setting when creating a Dataverse database" width = "400" height = "680"> <br />

This option installs the sample apps and data into your database. Sample apps are for educational and demonstration purposes. We don't recommend installing sample apps in production databases. More information: [Create an environment with a database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database)

## Sample apps available
After you provision an environment with a database that include sample apps, the following model-driven apps are available in the environment.
- [Asset Checkout](#asset-checkout)
- [Innovation Challenge](#innovation-challenge)
- [Fundraiser](#fundraiser)

## Remove sample apps and data

- Deleting a sample app requires deleting the corresponding  [managed solution](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/uninstall-delete-solution). 
- Deleting the solution also deletes any sample data specific to the custom tables for the app.
- If customizations were made to the sample app, there may be [dependencies](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/dependency-tracking-solution-components), which must be removed before deleting the solution.
