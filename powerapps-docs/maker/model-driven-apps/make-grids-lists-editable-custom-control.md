# Make model-driven app views editable using the editable grid control

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

By default, users can't enter data directly using the read-only view control for views and subgrids on forms. Users select the row in the grid to open a form, edit the data, and then save, which requires multiple steps. With editable grids, users can do rich in-line editing directly from views and subgrids whether they're using a web app, tablet, or phone.

 When editable grids are enabled through the editable grid control, users can edit the data inside most types of columns, including basic Lookup columns and choices.  This avoids the need to navigate to a form.

When editable grids are enabled through the editable grid control, users can edit the data inside most types of columns, including basic lookup columns and choices.  This avoids the need to navigate to a form.

## Make main grids editable  

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. Select **Solutions**, open the solution you want, and then on the toolbar select **Switch to classic**.  This opens solution explorer in a new browser window.
  
2. In the **Entities** list (these represent Dataverse tables), open the table you want, select the **Controls** tab, and then select **Add Control**.  
  
     ![Add Editable Grids custom control.](media/add-editable-grids-custom-control.png "Add Editable Grids custom control")  
  
3. In the **Add Control** dialog box, select **Editable Grid**, and then select **Add**.  
  
4. In the **Editable Grid** row that's added, select the form factor(s) you want to apply the grid to. This makes the editable grid control the default control for the selected form factor(s).  As a minimum in most instances select **Web**.
  
     ![Editable Grid row with form factor selection.](media/editable-grid-row-wit-factor-selection.png "Editable Grid row with form factor selection")

   > [!NOTE]
   >  At runtime, users can toggle between editable grids and read-only grids.  
      
5.  To add a lookup, in the **Editable Grid** option group, select **Add Lookup**, and then in the **Configure Property "Add Lookup"** dialog box:  
  
    1.  In the **Available Views** list, select the view to add the lookup to (for example, select **My Active Accounts**).  
  
    2.  In the **Available Columns** list, select the lookup column to add (for example, select **Primary Contact**).  
  
    3.  In the **Default View** list, select the data source for the lookup column.  
  
    4.  If you want to limit the rows displayed, select the **Only show rows where** check box, and then select your criteria from the list, and then select **OK**.  
  
         ![Add lookup in Editable Grid control.](media/add-lookup-in-editable-grid-control.png "Add lookup in Editable Grid control")  
     
6.  If you have a nested grid, select the pencil button for **Nested grid view**, and then select the table and view for the nested grid. For the **Nested grid parent ID** select the relationship for the tables. For example, the **ParentAccountID** column connects the **Account** and **Contact** tables.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Nested grids are only available for phones and tablets, not the web.  
  
7.  If you don't want to allow the user to group data by any column in the view (you want to save space, for example), in the **Group by Column** row, select the pencil button, and then in the **Configure Property "Group by Column"** dialog box, select **Disabled**, and then select **OK**.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  This is mostly useful for sub-grids on forms.  
  
8.  If you want to add JavaScript events, select the **Events** tab, and then select the appropriate tables, columns, and events. More information: [Developer Documentation: Use editable grids](../../developer/model-driven-apps/use-editable-grids.md)
  
     ![Add events in Editable Grid control.](media/add-events-in-editable-grid-control.png "Add events in Editable Grid control")  
  
9. To save your work, select **Save** on the action bar.  
  
10. When you're ready to make changes available to your team, select **Publish** on the action bar.  
  
11. To test your changes, go to the view you specified in step 5, and then make some in-line editing changes.  
  
## Make a subgrid on a form editable

> [!NOTE] 
> - To save an editable grid change within a sub-grid, the user must explicitly save before navigating out of the form.
  
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
  
2. Select **Solutions**, open the solution you want. 
  
3. Select the **Table** within the solution, and then navigate to the **Forms** tab.  Select the **Main Form** that contains the subgrid.

4. Select **Switch to Classic**. This will open a new tab in your browser.
  
5. Select the appropriate control, and then select **Change Properties** on the ribbon.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/editable-subgrid-classic.png" alt-text="Editable subgrid - classic view":::

1. In the **Set Properties** dialog box, select **Controls**.

2. Select **Add Control**, select **Editable Grid**, and then select **Add**.  
  
3. In the **Editable Grid** row that's added, select the form factor(s) you want to apply the grid to. This makes the editable grid control the default control for the selected form factor. For most instances select **Web**.

## Data types that aren't editable in an editable grid

The following data types aren't editable in editable grids: Customer and Partylist Lookup columns; Composite (address) columns; State/Status columns; Lookup table-related columns (for example, the Account table includes a contact lookup, where the Contact column is editable but the EmailAddress(Contact) column is not editable). 

## Group by views work on client side only

Grouping behavior works only on the client side and does not span pages. Group by is a client only function and works only on one page of data. Group by does not show you all options based on your complete data set on the server. Group by shows grouping only on the current page. You can disable the grouping by using the property on custom control configuration. More information: [Make main grids editable](#make-main-grids-editable)

## Business rules work only if conditional column is a column on the grid

Business rules on an editable grid are supported only if the conditional column is also a column on the grid. If the column is not a column the business rules won’t work. Verify that each column referenced in the business rule is also included on the form. Note that business rules on an editable grid do not fire if the editable grid is configured on a dashboard.
