# Make model-driven app grids (lists) editable using the Editable Grid custom control

In previous releases of Dynamics CRM, users couldn't enter data directly in grids (sometimes called lists) or sub-grids on forms. They had to select the record in the grid to open a form, edit the data, and then save, which required multiple steps. With editable grids, users can do rich in-line editing directly from views and sub-grids whether they're using a web app, tablet, or phone.

 When editable grids are enabled through the Editable Grids custom control, users can edit most types of fields, including basic Lookup fields and option sets.  

**Editable grids support:**
  
-   In-line editing of records at the entity or sub-grid level (includes custom entities)  
  
-   System views and personal views  
  
-   Web and mobile clients  
  
-   Navigation with a keyboard or mouse  
  
-   Grouping and sorting (you can group by/sort records on the client-side by any column in the current view)  
  
-   Filtering  
  
-   Moving and resizing columns  
  
-   Pagination  
  
-   Saving changes from one session to another for grouping, sorting, filtering, pagination, and moving and resizing columns  
  
-   Lookup configuration  
  
-   Calculated fields and rollup fields  
  
-   Business rules (Show error message, Set field value, Set business required, Set default value, Lock or unlock field)  
  
-   JavaScript events  
  
-   Enabling or disabling of cells based on security role  
  
-   Users can continue to use search and charts, and can access the action bar as with read-only grids  
  
## Make main grids editable  
  
1.  Open [solution explorer](advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer).  
  
2.  In the **Entities** list, open the appropriate entity, select the **Controls** tab, and then select **Add Control**.  
  
     ![Add Editable Grids custom control](media/add-editable-grids-custom-control.png "Add Editable Grids custom control")  
  
3.  In the **Add Control** dialog box, select **Editable Grid**, and then select **Add**.  
  
4.  In the **Editable Grid** row that's added, select the form factor(s) you want to apply the grid to. This makes the editable grid control the default control for the selected form factor(s).  
  
     ![Editable Grid row with form factor selection](media/editable-grid-row-wit-factor-selection.png "Editable Grid row with form factor selection")    

   > [!NOTE]
   >  At runtime, users can toggle between editable grids and read-only grids.  
      
5.  To add a lookup, in the **Editable Grid** option group, select **Add Lookup**, and then in the **Configure Property "Add Lookup"** dialog box:  
  
    1.  In the **Available Views** list, select the view to add the lookup to (for example, select **My Active Accounts**).  
  
    2.  In the **Available Columns** list, select the lookup column to add (for example, select **Primary Contact**).  
  
    3.  In the **Default View** list, select the data source for the lookup field.  
  
    4.  If you want to limit the records displayed, select the **Only show records where** check box, and then select your criteria from the list, and then select **OK**.  
  
         ![Add lookup in Editable Grid control](media/add-lookup-in-editable-grid-control.png "Add lookup in Editable Grid control")  
     
6.  If you have a nested grid, select the pencil button for **Nested grid view**, and then select the entity and view for the nested grid. For the **Nested grid parent ID** select the relationship for the entities. For example, the ParentAccountID field connects the **Account** and **Contact** entities.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Nested grids are only available for phones and tablets, not the web.  
  
7.  If you don't want to allow the user to group data by any column in the view (you want to save space, for example), in the **Group by Column** row, select the pencil button, and then in the **Configure Property "Group by Column"** dialog box, select **Disabled**, and then select **OK**.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  This is mostly useful for sub-grids on forms.  
  
8.  If you want to add JavaScript events, select the **Events** tab, and then select the appropriate entities, fields, and events. More information: [Developer Documentation: Use editable grids](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/customize-dev/use-editable-grids-dynamics-365.md)  
  
     ![Add events in Editable Grid control](media/add-events-in-editable-grid-control.png "Add events in Editable Grid control")  
  
9. To save your work, select **Save** on the action bar.  
  
10. When you're ready to make changes available to your team, select **Publish** on the action bar.  
  
11. To test your changes, go to the view you specified in step 5, and then make some in-line editing changes.  
  
## Make a sub-grid on a form editable

> [!NOTE] 
> - To save an editable grid change within a sub-grid, the user must explicitly save before navigating out of the form.
> - If you are using legacy forms (versions prior to Dynamics CRM 2016) and enable an editable grid on a sub-grid, the editable sub-grid will not be rendered. System administrators can turn off legacy forms in system settings, if needed.
  
1.  Open [solution explorer](advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer).  
  
2.  Open the form that contains the sub-grid.  
  
3.  Select the appropriate control, and then select **Change Properties** on the ribbon.  
  
4.  In the **Set Properties** dialog box, select **Controls**, select **Add Control**, and then follow the same steps listed above.

##  Data types that aren't editable in an editable grid
The following data types aren't editable in editable grids: Customer and Partylist Lookup fields; Composite (address) fields; State/Status fields; Lookup entity-related fields (for example, the Account entity includes a contact lookup, where the Contact field is editable but the EmailAddress(Contact) field is not editable). 

## Group by views work on client side only
Grouping behavior works only on the client side and does not span pages. Group by is a client only function and works only on one page of data. Group by does not show you all options based on your complete data set on the server. Group by shows grouping only on the current page. You can disable the grouping by using the property on custom control configuration. More information: [Make main grids editable](#make-main-grids-editable)

## Business rules work only if conditional field is a column on the grid
Business Rules on an editable grid are supported only if the conditional field is also a column on the grid. If the field is not a column the business rules wonâ€™t work. Verify that each field referenced in the business rule is also included on the form. Note that business rules on an editable grid do not fire if the editable grid is configured on a dashboard.
