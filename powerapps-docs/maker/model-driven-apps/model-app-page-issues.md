# Known issues with custom pages in a model-driven app

The custom page is a new page type within model-driven apps. Custom pages bring the power of canvas apps into model-driven apps. Below are the known issues to be aware of.

## Maker-related issues

* When a custom page is modified, such as saved and published, the model-driven app isn't aware of the change. The model-driven app will continue to use the last version of the custom page when the model-driven app was published. A model-driven app published through app designer, solution explorer, or **Publish all** will update all custom pages in the model-driven app.

* Images, icons and shapes are not currently supported with Right-To-Left (RTL) languages.
 
* The ability to get the current data formats from users settings including date, time, numbers and currency is not supported.

* Custom pages use a canvas app hosting session that can time out after 8 hours.  However, the Unified Interface session has a longer timeout. When the timeout happens, an error message bar appears that prompts the user to refresh the browser.

* When a custom page with code component is opened for editing, a security dialog is shown. Selecting **Go back** on the security dialog doesn't navigate back to the parent context. The user can close the browser tab to leave the canvas app designer.

* Not all canvas app controls are available with custom pages. However, custom pages support the most common canvas app controls and custom pro-dev components. For more information about what is available, see [Design a custom page for your model-driven app](design-page-for-model-app.md)

* Makers need to share custom pages to allow another maker to make changes, which is a different behavior than the typical model-driven app components. If a custom page can't be shared from the **Solutions** area, open the environment in Power Platform admin center, and then open **Resources** > **Power Apps** > **Page** > **Share**. Similarly, to reuse the canvas app components inside the custom page, the corresponding canvas app component library also needs to be shared with the custom page makers.

* The maker experience for the custom page doesn't have support for certain Power Apps component framework APIs like `Navigation` and Web APIs, which is in line with the stand-alone canvas apps. However, these APIs are available in the published app where the custom page is added to model-driven apps. More information: [Add code components to a custom page for your model-driven app.](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/page-code-components)

* The maker experience for the custom page is currently not enabled in sovereign clouds. If you would like to enable it for a maker session, append "powerappsPortalApps.enableEditInShellAppDesigner=true" as a query parameter to the https://make.powerapps.com/ url.

* Makers can't use cross-environment Dataverse references in a custom page.

## User-related issues

* When a user with no Power Apps user privileges opens a custom page in the model-driven app, they will see an error mentioning no active entitlements to use PowerApps.  More information: [Licensing overview for Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus) and the associated licensing guide.

* Custom pages require third-party cookies to be enabled, which is required by the canvas app runtime.

* When a user is prompted for consent with connectors and selects **Don't allow**, the custom page will render but without data.  The user doesn't get notified that data retrieval is skipped.

* After a model-driven app or custom page is changed and published, loading a custom page can take longer than normal and no page loading spinner is shown.

* Native player support is available for iOS, Android, and Windows in online-only mode. Offline support currently isn't supported.

* When navigating back to a custom page from another page, the page state isn't restored so the page appears like a new navigation.

* While attempting to sign in, the current behavior caused by a user selecting anywhere away from the sign in box causes the pop out window for sign in to shift behind the app browser.

* When a user runs an app that isn't compliant with their organization's [Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention), they'll see an error dialog and the 'Technical details' reflects the app isn't DLP compliant.
