# Design custom business apps by using the app designer

With PowerApps, custom business apps are comprised of components such as entities, dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes.  
  
 The app designer helps you bring together all these components quickly. Its tile-based information structure and simplified interface make the process of building an app much easier, and you can create apps that are specific to your business roles and functions without having to write any code.  
  
 Each app that you create can have its own site map with the integrated and easy-to-use site map designer.  Just drag and drop areas, groups, and subareas to the canvas. Components that you select in the site map are also added as entities in the app designer.  
  
 You can add or remove entities as necessary, and also add other components.  
  
 Once you're done adding components, you can validate your app to check if you have missed adding any required components, add those, and then publish the app for users.  
  
 The following table shows the steps you'll take to create an app.
