# Navigate to advanced model-driven app making and customization areas

This article describes how to access advanced customization and administration areas that are available within a Power Apps environment.

## Solutions

The [solutions](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#solution) area is where you can view, edit, create, import, export, and delete managed and unmanaged solutions.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. On the top right, select the [Environment](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#environment) where your solution is located.
3. On the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

## Solution explorer

Use classic solution explorer to perform app making and customization tasks that canâ€™t be completed from the Power Apps website (make.powerapps.com).

1. From Power Apps (make.powerapps.com), go to **Solutions** on the left navigation pane, and then open the solution your want. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. On the command bar select **Switch to classic**.

The solution explorer is displayed in a new browser window.
