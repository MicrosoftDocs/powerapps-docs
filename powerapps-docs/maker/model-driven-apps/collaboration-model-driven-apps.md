# Collaboration in model-driven apps

Collaboration features help fusion teams work together to build model-driven apps. The commenting feature introduces the best way to work asynchronously with other makers or leave notes for yourself within the app context. Copresence and coauthoring help you better work with other makers in the same app in real-time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Commenting is available for all model-driven app makers. For real-time collaboration, you will have either the copresence or coauthoring experience as the copresence and coauthoring features are being deployed separately:
> - Most preview environments will have coauthoring available. More information: [Coauthoring in model-driven apps (preview)](coauthoring.md) 
> - For preview environments that donâ€™t have coauthoring available, the environment will use copresence. More information: [Discover who's working on an app](copresence.md)
