   | Display activities using | Default fields |

   | Select activity | Email |
   | Select card form | Email Card form |

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]

## Customize field sections

In the timeline section, users see a card for each activity (based on the enabled activities). Each card displays certain fields in the collapsed and expanded mode. For example, see **Email** activity card in collapsed mode, hover mode, and expanded mode. 

**Email card collapsed mode**: By default, the activity cards are in collapsed mode.


   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Timeline card in collapsed mode](media/email.png "Timeline card in collapsed mode")

**Email card hover mode**: When you hover your cursor, you can see few commands that are specific to each of the activity card types.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Timeline card in collapsed mode](media/email-hover.png "Timeline card in collapsed mode")

**Timeline card expanded mode**: When you select on card, it gets expanded with few commands that are specific to each of the activity card types.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Timeline card in expanded mode](media/email-expanded.png "Timeline card in expanded mode")

In the card, if you want to show any fields that are important to your business, you can customize the fields. Also, you can move the fields from one section to another section, such as from the **Header** section to the **Detail** section. To learn more, see [Customize the card form](#customize-the-card-form).

### Customize the card form

Any card form has the following sections:

   | Section annotation | Section name | Display columns |
   |------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | A | ColorStrip | ColorStrip section is never displayed to the user. |
   | B | Header | Fields 1 and 2 in are displayed to the user. |
   | C | Details | Fields 3, 4, and 5 are displayed to the user where Fields 3 and 4 are displayed in the collapsed mode and Field 5 is displayed in the expanded mode. |
   | D | Footer | Footer section is never displayed to the user. |

For example, see **Email form**.

**Email configuration screen**

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Email card configuration](media/customize-field-email.png "Email card configuration")

**Email card collapsed mode**

Fields **1** and **2** from the **Header** section and Fields **3** and **4** from the **Details** section are displayed in the collapsed mode. Fields **3** and **4** in the collapsed mode doesn't show contents in the rich text format.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]

**Email card hover mode**

FieldsÂ **1**Â andÂ **2**Â from theÂ **Header**Â section and FieldsÂ **3**Â andÂ **4**Â from theÂ **Details**Â section are displayed in the hover mode.

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Email card in collapsed mode](media/email-card-hover.png "Email card in collapsed mode")

**Email card expanded mode**

Field **5** from the **Details** section is displayed in the expanded mode. Field **3** in the expanded mode doesn't shown contents in the rich text format, whereas field **4** in the expanded mode shows contents in the rich text format.

To customize the card form, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your `https://<YourOrgURL>.dynamics.com/apps` environment.

2.  Open a model-driven app, and then on the command bar select **Settings** ![Settings](../model-driven-apps/media/powerapps-gear.png "Settings") > **Advanced  Settings**.

   In this procedure, we'll modify **Email Card**. 

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Email card configuration](media/customize-field-email1.png "Email card configuration")

   In the **Header** section, the **Created on** field is replaced with **Priority**.

> [!Note]
> If a field doesn't have any value, then in the card, the field value remains empty.
