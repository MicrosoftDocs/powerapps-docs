# Configure suggested actions in model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Suggested actions help users focus on what matters most by surfacing intelligent, context-aware recommendations for high-value records. These actions are defined by makers and dynamically suggested upon record navigation to users based on record data and inferred business logic.

This guide walks thorugh how to configure suggested actions.

## Prerequisites
- The [Copilot in Power Apps](../canvas-apps/ai-overview..md) environment flag must be enabled. 

## Why suggested actions matter
In model-driven apps, users often spend significant time identifying which records are most urgent, deciding what to do next, and executing those tasks. Suggested actions reduce this effort by guiding users toward meaningful next steps that help them act faster and more intelligently.

>[!NOTE]
>Suggested actions are generated by combining maker-defined criteria with app data and historical usage. When a user navigates to a record, the system evaluates whether any configured actions apply by inferring business logic from maker input and past behavior. It then generates potential actions, filters them based on confidence, and surfaces only the most relevant ones. When a user completes or dismisses suggested actions, it feeds back into the system to improve future recommendations.
