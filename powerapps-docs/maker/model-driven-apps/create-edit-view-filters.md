# Create or edit filters in model-driven app views

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<a name="BKMK_CreateOrEditViewFilters"></a>   

The filters in a Power Apps view are important to the value provided by the view. The filters you apply determine which rows appear in the list by default. You can add or edit a filter for the columns that you include in a view by selecting the column and selecting **Filter by**. You can also use the expression builder in the view designer. Use the expression builder to add or edit filters for any columns of the table in the current view or any columns in a related table. 

In this topic, you create or edit filters by performing the following tasks:

-   [Edit or remove a filter condition](create-edit-view-filters.md#edit-or-remove-a-filter-condition)

-   [Open the expression builder](create-edit-view-filters.md#open-the-expression-builder)

-   [Add conditions to a filter](create-edit-view-filters.md#add-conditions-to-a-filter)

-   [Add a group condition to a filter](create-edit-view-filters.md#add-a-group-condition-to-a-filter)

-   [Add a related table to a condition](create-edit-view-filters.md#add-a-related-table-to-a-condition)

-   [Group conditions of a filter](create-edit-view-filters.md#group-conditions-of-a-filter)

## Edit or remove a filter condition

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).  

2. Expand **Data**, select **Tables**, select the table that you want, and then select the **Views** tab.

3. Select a view to open it. The view properties panel lists existing filters.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![View panel filters](media/views-panel-filters.png "View panel filters")

4. On the view properties panel, select a filter condition.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Edit filters](media/edit-filter-viewpanel.png "Edit filters")

5. Select the conditional operator that you want to use.

6. Type or select the comparison value for the condition.

7. Select **Apply**.

8. To remove a condition, select **Close**. The condition is removed without confirmation.

### Open the expression builder

- On the view properties panel, select **Edit filters**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Expression builder](media/edit-create-filters.png "Expression builder")

### Add conditions to a filter

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add row**.

2. Select a column for the condition.

3. Select a conditional operator.

4. Select a comparison value.  

    Some filter conditions don't require a comparison value for the condition. For example, the operator **Contains data** doesn't require a comparison value. With other filter conditions, you choose the comparison value from an option set. For example, the **Status** column has an option set that contains the values **Active** and **Inactive**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Filter condition](media/add-condition-filter.png "Filter condition")

5. Select **OK**.

### Add a group condition to a filter

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add group**.

2. Select the relational operator **Or** for the group. **And** is the default relational operator.

3. Specify the first clause of the grouped condition. Select the column, conditional operator, and comparison value.

4. Select **Add** > **Add group**

5. Specify the second clause of the grouped condition.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Group condition filter](media/add-group-filter.png "Group condition filter")

    You can select **Collapse** to display the group as a conditional expression.

### Add a related table to a condition

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add related table**.

2. Select a column from the current table that is related to another table. The table related to the column is shown in parenthesis. You can select columns that have a many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship with the related table.

3. Select a column of the related table for the condition.

4. Select a conditional operator.

5. Select or enter a comparison value.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Related table filter](media/add-relatedentity-filter.png "Related table filter")

### Group conditions of a filter

1. In the expression builder, select the check box for the conditions that you want to group.

2. Select **More commands** (...) for one of the conditions, and then select **Make group**.

3. To ungroup a group, select **More commands** (...) for the group, and then select **Ungroup**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Grouped condition filter](media/group-conditions-filter.png "Grouped condition filter")
