# Work with model-driven app pages

App designer pages are containers for tables, dashboards, custom pages, or web resources. Pages determine your app's assets and navigation. You can choose whether to have the page appear in the app navigation (site map) or not.

## Create a page

To create a page, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), select **Apps**, and then **Edit** the app you want.

1. Select the page type, and then select **Next**:  
   - **Dataverse table**: Display records of a standard or custom table in a full-page list view. Creating a data view page also adds an associated form page for viewing and editing data on a selected record. More information: [Tables in Dataverse](../data-platform/entity-overview.md)
   - **Dashboard**: Display charts and tables from multiple entities to visualize data on a single page. Select one or more system, interactive, or Power BI dashboards. More information: [Create or edit model-driven app dashboards](create-edit-dashboards.md)
   - **Custom page**: Design and build a page that's based on a canvas app. More information: [Overview of custom pages for model-driven apps](model-app-page-overview.md)
   - **Web resource**: Select a web resource from a list of web resources. More information: [Create or edit model-driven app web resources to extend an app](create-edit-web-resources.md)
   - **Navigation link**: Enter a direct link to a web resource. [Create or edit model-driven app web resources to extend an app](create-edit-web-resources.md)
1. If you don't want your page to appear in the app's site map, clear the **Show in navigation** option.
