# Work with model-driven app pages

App designer pages are containers for one or more tables or dashboards. You can choose whether to have the page appear in the app navigation (site map) or not.

## Create a page

To create a page follow these steps:
1. Select **New page** in the app designer.
1. Select the page type, and then select **Next**:  
   - **Table based view and form**: Display records of a standard or custom table in a full-page list view. Creating a data view page also adds an associated form page for viewing and editing data on a selected record. More information: [Tables in Dataverse](../data-platform/entity-overview.md)
   - **Dashboard**: Display charts and tables from multiple entities to visualize data on a single page. Select one or more system, interactive, or Power BI dashboards. More information: [Create or edit model-driven app dashboards](create-edit-dashboards.md)
   - **Custom**: Design and build a page that's based on a canvas app. More information: [Overview of custom pages for model-driven apps](model-app-page-overview.md)
1. If you don't want your page to appear in the app's site map, clear the **Show in navigation** option.

## Work with tables on a page

### Create a table for a page

1. In the model-driven app designer, select **Add page**, select **Table based view and form** as the page type, and then select **Next**.

1. If you selected **Create a new table**: 
   - Enter the table a name in the **Display name** field.
   - Optionally, specify the table **Record ownership** from the **Advanced options** area.

### Edit a table for a page

From the **Pages** area in app designer, select **...** to the right of the table name, and then select **Edit**.

The table designer opens for you to make changes to the table.
