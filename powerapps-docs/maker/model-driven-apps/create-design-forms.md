# Create and design model-driven app forms 

With Power Apps model-driven apps, forms provide the user interface that people use to interact with the data they need to do their work. It's important that the forms people use are designed to allow them to find or enter the information they need efficiently.

:::image type="content" source="../../maker/model-driven-apps/media/form-no-header.png" alt-text="Example model-driven App form":::

In the default solution or an unmanaged solution, it is possible to create new forms or edit existing forms for all tables that allow form customization.

### Forms inside unmanaged solutions

In an unmanaged solution, it is possible to edit the properties, including columns, views, and forms, for an unmanaged custom table that was created for the solution.  Unmanaged solutions are where app makers and developers go to author changes that they require and typically exist in a development environment.

### Forms inside managed solutions

In a managed solution, typically in a production environment, it is not possible by default to create new forms or edit existing forms for tables. However, if the managed properties for a table in the managed solution are set to allow customization, you can add or edit forms for that table.

## Form types
There are different types of forms, and each type has a specific functionality or use.  These include:

- Main (the main user interface).
- Quick create (rapid data entry).
- Quick view (to see related data).
- Card form (a compact view).
  
More information: [Types of forms in Power Apps](types-forms.md).

## Create or edit a form

The fundamentals of building a model-driven app include creating a table, configuring data views, and creating and editing forms.

Before you begin to build forms, it is worth determining whether you have all the columns necessary to solve your business problem. Additionally, you should have an understanding how to lay these out in terms of sections and tabs.  Broadly speaking, the complexity of your forms will be a reflection of the number of columns in your table in addition to the complexity of your business process.

[Learn to create, edit, or configure forms using the form designer](create-and-edit-forms.md)

## Delete a form

To delete a form, sign in to Power Apps and go to **Solutions** > Open the solution you want > select the table that you want > **Forms** area. Select the form, and then select **Delete** on the command bar.

There are a couple of reasons you may not be able to delete a form.

|Reason  |Work around  |
|---------|---------|
| Every table requires at least one main form and it is the only main form for the table.   |  Create a new main form for the table. Then delete the main form you tried earlier.  More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form)   |
| Every table requires one designated fallback form and it is the only fallback form.   | Create a new form for the table and set as the fallback. Or designate another existing form as the fallback form. Then delete the form you tried earlier. More information: [Set the fallback form for a table](control-access-forms.md#set-the-fallback-form-for-a-table)     |

## Controlling the display of a form within an app

Tables can have multiple forms.  The use of a form is controlled through the model-driven app. This allows makers to use the same table in different ways, depending on the audience, by controlling the display.

By default all forms are made available to users. However, through the app designer a specific form can be restricted.

### Change the forms displayed in an app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. Select **Solutions**, and then open the solution to be updated.
3. Edit the model-driven app in app designer.
4. In the **Table View** area, select **Forms** next to the table.  The components tab will become visible.

   :::image type="content" source="../../maker/model-driven-apps/media/create-and-edit-a-model-driven-form/select-forms-to-display-app-app-designer.png" alt-text="select forms to display in the app designer":::

5. On the **Components** tab, verify the main forms that are included for the app. Verify that the form you want to display is checked. If not, select it, save, and then publish the app.

   > ![Forms included with app.](media/forms-included-in-app.png "Forms included with app")

## Setting the default form for an app

A form can be set as the default form through the form order configuration **or** when a user sets the default form as a personalization setting.

When we set the default form order this is done at the level of the **table** and not the app.  Therefore, one form order per table.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. Select **Dataverse** and navigate to the required table.
3. Select the **Forms** area, select the ellipses (...) and select **Form settings**

:::image type="content" source="../../maker/model-driven-apps/media/create-and-edit-a-model-driven-form/form-settings-navigation.png" alt-text="select forms forms to include in app":::

4. In the form settings dialogue select **form order** and then the **form set**, or form type, you would like to order.

:::image type="content" source="../../maker/model-driven-apps/media/create-and-edit-a-model-driven-form/form-settings-order.png" alt-text="select forms order":::

5. Once in the form order area use the handles to move the order of the forms.

6. Select **Save and Publish** to save the form order changes.

## Updated versus classic tables

Power Apps provides many options for designing forms using the form designer.
  
There are still a number of tables, referred to here as classic tables, that retain the appearance and capabilities from earlier versions. These tables are used less often. They are listed here:

## Main form dialogs
With the client API, you can use main form dialogs so users can open a related row table on a parent or base form without navigating away from the form. More information: [Open main form in a dialog using client API](../../developer/model-driven-apps/customize-entity-forms.md#open-main-form-in-a-dialog-using-client-api)
