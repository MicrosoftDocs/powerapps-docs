# Customize the screen size and orientation of a canvas app embedded on a model-driven form
This topic explains how to customize the screen size and orientation of a canvas app embedded on a model-driven form.

1.  Follow the steps to add or edit an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form.
    - [Add an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form](embedded-canvas-app-add-classic-designer.md)
    - [Edit a canvas app embedded on a model-driven form](embedded-canvas-app-edit-classic-designer.md)
2. With the canvas app open in PowerApps Studio, select the **File** tab, and then select **App settings**.
3. Select the **Screen size + orientiation** tab. By default, the **Size** is set to **Custom**.
4. Select from the list of available **Size** and **Orientation** options or select **Custom** and provide desired values for **Width** and **Height**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > When **Size** is set to **Custom**, **Orientation** is disabled since it is determined based on the **Width** and **Height** you specify.
5. When you are done making changes, select the **File** tab, and then select **Save**.
6. To make your changes available to end-users select **Publish** and then select **Publish this version**.
