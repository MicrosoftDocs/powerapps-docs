# Add model-driven app form navigation for related tables

In this topic, you use the form navigation pane that is used to add links to related tables. When an app user clicks one of these links in a row, the associated view for the table is displayed.   
  
1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).  

2.  Expand **Data**, select **Tables**, select the table that you want, and then select the **Forms** tab. 
  
3.  In the list, open a form with the type of **Main** to edit it.

4.  Select **Switch to classic** to edit the form in the classic form designer.
  
5.  To add a link to a related table, on **Home** tab, in the **Select** group, choose **Navigation**.  
  
     The **Relationship Explorer** pane displays on the right side of the form editor.  
  
6.  In the **Relationship Explorer** pane, in the **Filter** list, select one of the following options:  
  
    - **Available Relationships**. Lists all the tables that can be related to the table the form is associated with.  
  
    - **1:N Relationships**. Lists tables that can be related in a 1:N relationship to the table the form is associated with.  
  
    - **N:N Relationships**. Lists tables that can be related in a N:N relationship to the table the form is associated with.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If no related tables show up in the **Relationship Explorer** pane, you cannot create a link on this form to a related table.  
  
7.  Select the related table you want to link to, drag it to the Navigation Pane, and then drop it where you want it to be displayed.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  You can also create a new relationship by choosing **New 1:N** or **New N:N** in the **Relationship Explorer** pane.   
  
8. To edit the properties for this or any other related table link, in the Navigation Pane, select the link, and then on the **Home** tab, choose **Change Properties**.  
  
9. In the **Relationship Properties** dialog box, on the **Display** tab, type a new display label.  
  
10. On the **Name** tab, choose **Edit** to view or edit the details associated with the relationship row.  
  
11. Choose **OK**.  
  
12. Preview how the main form will appear and how events will function:  
  
    1.  On the **Home** tab, choose **Preview**, and then select **Create Form**, **Update Form**, or **Read-Only Form**.  
  
    2.  To close the **Preview** form, on the **File** menu, choose **Close**.  
  
13. When you finish editing the form, choose **Save and Close** to close the form.  
  
14. When your customizations are complete, publish them:  
  
    -   To publish customizations for only the component that you are currently editing, in the Navigation Pane, choose the table you have been working on, and then choose **Publish**.  
  
    -   To publish customizations for all unpublished components at one time, in the Navigation Pane, choose **Tables**, and then on the command bar, choose **Publish All Customizations**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Installing a solution or publishing customizations can interfere with normal system operation. We recommend that you schedule a solution import when it's least disruptive to users.
