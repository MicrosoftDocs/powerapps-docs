# Apply custom business logic with business rules and flows in model-driven apps

Defining and enforcing consistent business processes is one of the main reasons people use model-driven apps. Consistent processes help make sure people using a model-driven app can focus on their work and not on remembering to perform a set of manual steps. 

## Business rules

Business rules provide a simple interface to implement and maintain fast-changing and commonly used rules. The *scope* of a business rule defines where the business rule will run:

|||  
|-|-|  
|**If you select this item...**|**The scope is set to...**|  
|**Entity**|All forms and server|  
|**All Forms**|All forms|  
|Specific form (**Account** form, for example)|Just that form| 

For more information about defining business rules for a form in a model-driven app, see [Create business rules to apply logic in a model-driven app form](create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To define a business rule for an entity so that it applies at the server level to both *canvas apps* and *model-driven apps*, see [Create a business rule for an entity](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-create-business-rule).

## Flows  
  
Power Automate includes several types of processes, each designed for a different purpose:  

-   Automated flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks automatically after it's triggered by an event. More information: [Create a flow](/flow/get-started-logic-flow)
    
-   Button flows. Perform repetitive tasks simply by tapping a button on your mobile device. More information: [Introducing button flows](/flow/introduction-to-button-flows)
  
-   Scheduled flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks on a schedule such as once a day, on a specific date, or after a certain time. More information: [Run flows on a schedule](/flow/run-scheduled-tasks)
  
-   Business process flows.  Ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work in an app by creating a business process flow. More information: [Business process flows overview](/flow/business-process-flows-overview)

-   Workflows and actions. Dynamics 365 customizers may be familiar with the classic Common Data Service processes, which are workflows and actions. More information: [Use Workflow processes](/flow/workflow-processes) and [Actions overview](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/actions)
