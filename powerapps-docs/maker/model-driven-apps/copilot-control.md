# Add the Copilot control to the rich text editor (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Copilot control is available in the email form's rich text editor toolbar by default. You can add the Copilot control to the rich text editor in other forms by changing the editor's properties in its advanced configuration file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature. [!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Prerequisites

[Have a configuration file for the rich text editor](rich-text-editor-control.md#customize-the-rich-text-editor-control) in the form where you want to add the Copilot control.

## Add the Copilot control

To add the Copilot control to the rich text editor toolbar in a form, you need to add a value that represents it to the `extraPlugins` and `toolbar` properties in the editor's advanced configuration file.

1. Open the editor's advanced configuration file.
1. Add the following values in the [`defaultSupportedProps` section](rich-text-editor-control.md#rich-text-editor-properties) of the file:

    - In the `extraPlugins` property, add `copilotrefinement`.
    - In the `toolbar` property, add `CopilotRefinement`.

    It should look something like the following example, where "&hellip;" represents values that aren't shown to save space:

    ```text
    "defaultSupportedProps": {
        ...
        "extraPlugins": "computedfont,...,copilotrefinement",
        ...
        "toolbar":[{ "items": ["CopyFormatting", ... ,"CopilotRefinement"]}]
    },
    ```

1. Save the file, and then publish the changes.
