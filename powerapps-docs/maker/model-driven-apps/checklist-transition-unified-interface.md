# Checklist: Unified Interface transition

Follow the steps in this article to ensure that you're prepared for transition to the
Unified Interface. Readiness for transitioning to Unified Interface will depend on whether you are
aiming for basic compatibility or redesigning to take full advantage of new
capabilities. For more detailed information, see the [Unified Interface playbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/unified-interface-playbook)
and [user experience white paper](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/approaching-unified-interface).

The instructions apply to the following model-driven apps in Dynamics 365:

- Dynamics 365 Sales

- Dynamics 365 Customer Service

- Dynamics 365 Field Service

- Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation

## Run the Power Apps Solution Checker on your solutions

The [Power Apps solution checker](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-powerapps-checker) performs a rich static analysis check on your solutions against a set of best practice rules to quickly identify problematic patterns. After the check completes, you receive a detailed report that lists the issues identified, the
components and code affected, and links to documentation that describes how to
resolve each issue.

The solution checker analyzes these solution components:

-   Common Data Service plug-ins

-   Common Data Service custom workflow activities

-   Common Data Service web resources (HTML and JavaScript)

-   Common Data Service configurations, such as SDK message steps

**Things to consider** 

-   Potential issues detected by the solution checker may not exclusively apply
    to the Unified Interface, be mindful of what will impact transition when
    reviewing results.

-   As in any automated code review, some issues can be false alarms and don’t
    mean that your application won’t run in Unified Interface.

-   Logic executed on the server side, such as plug-ins, custom workflow
    activities, and the configuration of SDK message steps shouldn’t impact the
    user interface and hence shouldn’t impact the transition to Unified
    Interface.

-   Even if the all issues aren’t directly associated with the Unified
    Interface, we recommend that you spend time reviewing them to improve the
    overall health of your application.

## Check third-party solutions compatibility with Unified Interface


Prior to transitioning to the Unified Interface, it’s important that you make
sure that any third-party solution that you use in your application works in
Unified Interface.

-   If you have installed ISV (Independent Software Vendor) add-ins through
    [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), check if upgrades are
    available in the [Power Platform Admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) by selecting **Environments** > [environment_name] > **Manage Solutions**.

-   If you are using third-party solutions that were provided outside of
    AppSource, contact the provider (Partner or ISV) to get a new version that
    updates the apps to Unified Interface.

> [!NOTE]
> If there are no plans for your third-party solutions to be updated to a
    version compatible with Unified Interface, it is important to identify a
    path to replace these features with either native platform capabilities or
    alternative solutions that are compatible.

## Identify replacements for deprecated features

Based on the outputs of the **Power Apps Solution Checker** and the information
contained in [Important changes (deprecations) coming](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming) on deprecated client APIs and
features, you should have a good understanding of the customizations and features that
either need to be corrected or replaced in your Unified Interface project.

Here are some of the most common areas needing attention:

-   **Client API**: Recommended replacement methods are documented
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming#some-client-apis-are-deprecated).

-   **Process dialogs**: Recommended replacements for dialogs are documented
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/replace-dialogs).

-   **Task flows**: Consider using [Business Process
Flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform-release-plan/2019wave2/microsoft-flow/business-process-immersive-experiences) to replace task flows.

-   **Dynamics 365 for Outlook (COM Add-in)**: Consider replacing the [deprecated](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#dynamic-365-for-outlook-is-deprecated) Dynamics 365 for Outlook (COM Add-in) with the modern, lightweight [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/outlook-app/overview). For further information and steps to make a smooth transition, download [Dynamics 365 for Outlook (COM add-in) Playbook](https://aka.ms/OutlookCOMPlaybook)

- **Dynamics 365 Customer Service**:
    -   Service scheduling: Consider using [Universal Resource Scheduling](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/common-scheduler/schedule-anything-with-universal-resource-scheduling) instead of legacy service scheduling.
    - [Deprecated knowledge management entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dynamicscrm-2016/administering-dynamics-365/dn265924(v=crm.8)#some-knowledge-management-entities-are-deprecated): See this topic to work with the latest knowledge management entities: [Work with knowledge articles](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-service/work-knowledge-articles).
    - [Deprecated contract entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming#contracts-contract-line-items-and-contract-templates-entities-are-deprecated): See this topic to migrate to entitlements: [Contracts to entitlements migration strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-service/contract-to-entitlement-migration). 

## Test your application in Unified Interface

One of the easiest ways to test your application in Unified Interface is to turn
on the [**Enable Unified Interface Only**](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/enable-unified-interface-only) option on a copy of your production environment. After the Unified Interface is enabled, you should be able to access your application using the **Dynamics 365 –
Custom** app and test the use cases relevant to your context.

### Test your business and technical scenarios

Focus on what could potentially be impacted:

-   **Business processes** such as business process flows, business rules

-   **Customizations** such as forms, views, command bar buttons, web resources, and charts

> [!TIP]
> Challenge the user experience at the same time as doing these early tests: is everything meaningful and adding value? What should be removed/improved/added? For example, are the current list of views relevant? Or are my users forced to create their own views?

### Identify gaps

-   Any potential regressions that weren’t already spotted by the solution
    checker and third-party solution updates.

-   User pain points that could lead to optimizations (such as new form
    rendering by reorganizing sections and tabs) or specific training.

-   Any other dependencies on the legacy web client such as the use of the
    legacy Outlook COM Add-in instead of the lightweight Dynamics 365 App for
    Outlook.

## Define your app strategy and settings

Instead of using the **Dynamics 365 – Custom** app, which isn‘t optimized for
Unified Interface but rather runs in compatibility mode, we suggest that you
leverage either first-party apps made by Microsoft or create your owns apps.

The Dynamics 365 apps that have already been optimized for Unified
Interface are the following:

-   Dynamics 365 Sales Hub

-   Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub

-   Dynamics 365 Marketing

-   Dynamics 365 Field Service (version 8.x and later)

-   Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation (version 3.x and later)

### What are model-driven apps?

**Model-driven apps** are a type of app you can create using Power Apps that helps you provide tailored experience to your users depending on their role in the organization. For example, a salesperson can have a completely different experience than a customer service representative through different model-driven apps even though they are using data from the same environment. Multiple model-driven apps can be created in a Common Data Service environment. More information: [What are model-driven apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)

The Dynamics 365 apps listed earlier are examples of model-driven apps.

### How to define your app strategy?

Ask yourself the following questions:

1.  Can you split your users into multiple groups with specific business
    processes?

2.  Do these groups have different requirements for what they should see and do?

3.  Are you finding it difficult to have different user experiences without
    using apps?

If you have answered "Yes" to these questions then consider having
multiple apps.

This is the opportunity to rethink the experience in the context of business
processes for each group or role.

### Out-of-the-box apps (for example, Sales Hub) or customized apps?

-   It depends how tailored you’d like the experience to be.

-   If you have few customizations or want to benefit from first-party app
    updates, then consider using native apps.

-   If you want more control over the experience and updates of standard apps
    and customizations, then create your own app.

### Once you have defined your app strategy, what should be the next steps?

1.  Customize your target apps and only include what users will need. Less is better. Reduce the clutter to enable users to work efficiently.

2.  Dissociate security roles from unused apps.

## Review your apps settings and user experience fundamentals

### App settings

-   Include all required entities in your app, even if they are not in the
    sitemap.  
    
-   Provide the **Read** privilege for **Model-driven app** in the **Customization** tab in the **Security Role** dialog box.

-   Enable the **Unified Interface only** mode if your users don’t need to use
    the legacy web client. You can still access administration features by
    selecting **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.

-   Create a simpler app URL. For example: https://\*.crm.dynamics.com/apps/MyApp*

-   Try to limit the number of apps a user can access.  
    
    > [!TIP]
    > When **Use Unified Interface only** is set to **Yes** and when users only
    have access to one app, they are automatically redirected to the app when
    they access the root URL (https://\*.crm.dynamics.com)*

### Optimize navigation (sitemap)

-   Define one main **area** with the most used **sub-areas** (dashboard,
    entities, etc.) organized in **groups**

-   Create one or more additional areas for less used features
    (configuration, settings, etc.). The idea is to help your users focus only on what’s important to do their work.

### Update icons

-   Transitioning to the Unified Interface is a good opportunity to refresh
    icons.

-   We recommend **SVG** format as they render well regardless of screen
    resolution.

    > [!TIP]
    > Example of SVG icon format:  
    > Width​ and height: 16px; Padding: 0px; Background: transparent; Icon
    color: \#FF000000  
    > To avoid rendering issues, open the SVG file with an editor (for example, Notepad) and remove fill="\#000000"

## Enrich your app with Unified Interface exclusive features

-   Create a **Welcome Page** that users see when they access each of your app. This is a great opportunity to guide users in their first steps.

-   Use existing **Custom Controls** to improve the usability of most field
    types, especially on mobile. For example, replace a 0 to 5 field rating with stars, replace a view of
    appointments with a calendar view, replace a sub-grid view with card forms.

-   Leverage **Reference Panels** on forms to bundle multiple views, quick
    views, and KB search feature in a single place.

-   Leverage the [Power Apps Component
    Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview)
    to add even more custom controls. You can get some from the community or from partners and ISVs.

-   Embed [canvas
    apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started)
    in your forms to easily extend your application. No-code or low-code extension of your app without the need to develop custom HTML/JS web resources.

-   Embed **Power BI** reports and tiles in forms: consolidate data across
    multiple systems in a single view.

-   Consider leveraging **Interactive Dashboards** to configure a one-stop
    workplace that allows global filtering across dashboard components.

-   Configure **Custom Help Panes and Guided Tasks** so that users quickly get
    help and guidance.

## Conduct user acceptance testing

It is very important that your applications, business scenarios, and technical
scenarios are tested by your business users in Unified Interface in conditions
that are similar to your production environment. These users can act as business
champions to help scale knowledge across the business.

Testing will help identify remaining items to be addressed before transitioning
all of your users to Unified Interface.

## Update user training materials

Conduct a review of your existing and planned training materials to ensure they
have the latest screenshots and reflect any changes you have made to the user
flow.

## Check your transition date

On December 1, 2020, [the legacy web client will no longer be
available](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/important-changes-coming#legacy-web-client-is-deprecated).
Be sure to migrate well in advance to ensure there’s time for any issues to be
addressed.
