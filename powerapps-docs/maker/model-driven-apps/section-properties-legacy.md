# Model-driven app form section properties

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

 A section in a form occupies the space available in a tab column. Sections have a label that can be displayed and a line may be shown below the label.  
  
 Sections can have up to 4 columns and includes options for displaying how labels for columns in the section are displayed.  
  
 Headers and footers are similar to sections but cannot be removed. If they don't contain anything they will not be shown.

||**Column Label Alignment**|Labels for columns within the section can be aligned left, right, or center.|  
||**Column Label Position**|Labels for columns within the section can be positions on the side or on top of the columns.|  


A new type of section called **Reference panel** can also be added. A Reference panel is a single column section. You can insert sub-grids, quick view control, or a Knowledge Base Search control inside a reference panel section. Each control that you added in the reference panel appears as a vertical tab within the panel at the runtime. You can drag and drop the various controls within the Reference panel section. The default tab at runtime is the first control added in the reference panel. The other tabs appear in the order in which they are added in the form editor. To delete a tab, use the delete key on your keyboard.  
  
When you insert a reference panel, by default it's added as a last section in the tab. You can add only one reference panel per form.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - By default, the reference panel section is locked in these standard forms: Cases, Accounts, and Contacts. To remove it or change it, you must unlock it.
> - Quick view forms are based on an organization and not at an app-level setting. So, any quick view form that is available, which may or may not be included in an app, will be used to render related information in a reference panel.
