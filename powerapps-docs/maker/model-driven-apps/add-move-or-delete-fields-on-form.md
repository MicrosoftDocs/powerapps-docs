# Add, configure, move, or delete columns on a form

Add, configure, move, or delete columns using the form designer.

## Add columns to a form

To add columns to a form, use the **Columns** pane. The **Columns** pane lets you search and filter to help you quickly find columns. It also includes the option to show only unused columns.

### Add columns to a form using drag and drop

> [!NOTE]
> When adding or moving columns using drag and drop be aware that the form preview is responsive andÂ may be rendering multiple section columns as stacked. To ensure that the column being added or moved is in the correct section column, drop or paste it anchored to another column that is already in that section column.
1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the command bar, select **Add column**, or in the left pane, select **Columns**.  The **Columns** pane is open by default when the form designer is opened. 
3. In the **Columns** pane, search, filter, or scroll to find the column you want to add. If you can't find a column, it might already be on the form. Clear **Show only unused columns** to view all columns, including those already added to the form. 
4. In the **Columns** pane, select a column and drag it onto the form preview. As you drag the column on the form preview, you will see drop targets where you can add the column. 
5. Drop the column in the location you want. Note the following: 
    - Columns can be dropped before or after any existing column or component.
    - Columns can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the column will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute columns and components across the section columns.
    - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a column changes the currently selected tab, allowing you to add the column to a different tab.   
6. Repeat steps 3-5 above if you want to add more columns.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

### Add columns to a form using selection 

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select another existing column or section. Note the following:
    - When you select an existing column, the new column is added after the existing column. 
    - When you select a section, the new column is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute columns across the section columns. 
3. In the command bar, select **Add column**, or in the left pane, select **Columns**. The **Columns** pane is open by default when the form designer is opened. 
4. In the **Columns** pane, search, filter, or scroll to find the column you want to add. If you can't find a column, it might already be on the form. Clear **Show only unused columns** to view all columns, including those already added to the form. 
5. In the **Columns** pane, select a column to add it to the form. Alternatively, select **...** next to the column you want, and then select **Add to selected section**. 
6. Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to add more columns.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

## Configure columns on a form
These are the properties and events available to configure a column when you create or edit a form using the form designer.

## Column properties

The **Properties** tab displays the following properties. 

|Area  |Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Display options** | **Table column** | The name of the column. This comes from the column properties on the table and is read-only.  |
|**Display options** |  **Label** | By default the label will match the display name of the column. You can override that name for the form by entering a different label here. <br /><br />This property is required. |
|**Display options** | **Hide label** | When selected, the column label is hidden. |
|**Display options** | **Hide on phone** | The column can be hidden to render a condensed version of the form on phone screens. |
|**Display options** | **Hide** | When selected, the column is hidden by default and can be shown using code. |
|**Display options** | **Lock** |  Lock this column so it can't be removed. |
|**Display options** | **Read-only** | When selected, the column value is not editable. |
|**Formatting** | **Column width** |  When the section containing the columns has more than one column you can set the column to occupy up to the number of columns that the section has. |
| **Components**  |  **+ Component**  | Adds a control to the column such as the canvas app control or the AI business card control.    |

> [!NOTE]
> In Unified Interface, the label size setting is ignored because the form adjusts width for all columns to ensure proper rendering for screen sizes from very small to extra-large.

## Column events

The **Events** tab is where event handlers for model-driven app forms can be configured for a column. An event handler consists of a reference to a JavaScript web resource and a function defined within that web resource that will execute when the event occurs, such as when the value for the column changes. More information: [Configure model-driven app form event handlers](configure-event-handlers-legacy.md)

## Move columns on a form

You can move a column on a form using drag and drop or cut and paste actions. 

### Move columns on a form using drag and drop

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the column that you want to move and drag and drop it. As you drag the column on the form preview, you will see drop targets where you can move the column to. 
   Note the following:
    - Columns can be dropped before or after any existing column or component.
    - Columns can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the column will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute columns and components across the section columns.
    - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a column changes the currently selected tab, allowing you to add the column to a different tab.   
3. Repeat step 2 above if you want to move more columns.
4. On the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

### Move columns on a form using cut and paste

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the column that you want to move.
3. On the command bar, select **Cut**.
4. In the form preview, select another existing column, component or section. You can also switch to a different tab if needed.
5. On the command bar, select **Paste** or select the chevron, and then select **Paste before**.      Note the following:
     - When you select **Paste**, the column that is moved is pasted after the existing column or component. 
     - When you select **Paste before**, the column that is moved is pasted before the existing column or component.
     - When you select a section, the column that is moved is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute columns and components across the section columns. The **Paste before** action is not applicable and therefore not available in this case.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more columns.
7. On the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

## Delete columns on a form

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the column that you want to delete from the form. 
3. On the command bar, select **Delete**. 
4. Repeat steps 2-3 if you want to delete more columns.
5. On the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

     > [!NOTE]
     >   -  If you delete a column by mistake, on the command bar, select **Undo** to revert the form to its previous state. 
     >   -  You can't delete a column that is locked or is required and not present anywhere else on the form. 

## Create a new column on the table when editing a form

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. On the command bar, select **Add column**, or in the left pane, select **Columns**. The **Columns** pane is open by default when the form designer is opened. 
3. In the **Columns** pane, select **+ New column**.
4. In the **New column** dialog, provide the **Display name** and **Name** for the column.
5. In the **New column** dialog, select the **Data type** and configure any other required properties of the column.

     > [!NOTE]
     >   -  Some column types are not available when you create a column from within the form designer. If a column type you want is not available, you can follow the steps outlined in [Create and edit columns for Microsoft Dataverse using Power Apps portal](../data-platform/create-edit-field-portal.md)

6. Select **Done** to create a new column on the table. The column appears in the **Columns** pane.
7. If you want to add the newly created column to the form, follow the steps outlined in the [**Add columns to a form**](add-move-or-delete-fields-on-form.md#add-columns-to-a-form) section.

     > [!NOTE]
     >  When a column is created on the table, it is not limited to the current form and will be available for use in other places.
