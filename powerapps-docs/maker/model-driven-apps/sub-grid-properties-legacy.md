# Sub-grid properties for model-driven app main forms overview

You can configure a sub-grid on a form to display a list of records.  

You can access **Sub-Grid properties** from the Power Apps site. 
1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

2.  Expand **Data**, select **Entities**, select the entity that you want, and then select the **Forms** tab. 

3.  In the list of forms, open a form of type **Main**, and then select **Components**. 

4.  From the Components pane, select **Subgrid**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select sub-grid views](media/sub-grid-views.png "Select sub-grid views")

5.  In **Entity**, select an entity whose records you want to display in the sub-grid. The **Entity** drop-down list is filtered to list only entities that are related to the current entity.

6.  In **Default view**, select a default view for the sub-grid. The is the view of the entity selected in the Entity property that will be used to get and display the list of records in the sub-grid.

7.  Select **Show related records** to display only records related to the current record that is displayed on the form.

8.  Select **Done** to add the sub-grid to the form. The properties of the sub-grid appear in the Properties pane.

|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Name**|**Required**: The unique name for the sub-grid that is used when referencing it in scripts. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.|  
|**Label**|**Required**: The localizable label for the sub-grid visible to users.|  
|**Hide label**|Whether the label should be displayed on the form. This is required if you enable **Display Search Box**. You can also choose to have the panel header color.|  
|**Hide on phone**|Specify whether the section should be available on phone.|
|**Show related records**| Sub-grid will display only records related to the current record.<br /> If you do not select this property, the sub-grid will display records filtered only by the default view or, if the view selector is enabled, any views the user chooses.<br /><br /> The option you choose will affect the behavior of the show list control. More information: [Show list behavior](#show-list-behavior) |  
|**Entity**|Depending on the option you choose for **Show related records**, this list displays either:<br /><br /> - Only related records: A list of entities that are related to this entity with the name of the lookup field on that entity which defines the relationship in parentheses.<br />- All record types: A list of all entities.|  
|**Default view**|Choose the view that will be applied by default. If you do not enable any other views using the **View Selector** property. This will be the only view.<br /><br /> Use the **Edit** button to open the default view for editing. Use the **New** button to create a new view to use for this sub-grid.|  
|**Allow users to change view**|When selected, app users can change from the Default view to another view of the entity selected in the Entity property.|

## Sub-grid properties for model-driven app main forms: Classic

You can configure a sub-grid on a form using the classic form designer to display a list of records or a chart. Select **Show Chart Only** on the **Display** tab to show a chart instead of a list.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
  > ![sub-grid properties](media/sub-grid-properties.png "sub-grid properties")

These are the properties available to configure when using a sub-grid component on a form using the classic form designer.

|Tab|Property|Description|

|**Display**|**Name**|**Required**: The unique name for the sub-grid that is used when referencing it in scripts. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.|  
||**Label**|**Required**: The localizable label for the sub-grid visible to users.|  
||**Display label on the Form**|Whether the label should be displayed on the form. This is required if you enable **Display Search Box**. You can also choose to have the panel header color.|  
||**Records**|Choose from two options:<br /><br /> - **Only Related Records**: Sub-grid will display only records related to the current record.<br />- **All Record Types**: Sub-grid will display records filtered only by the default view or, if the view selector is enabled, any views the user chooses.<br /><br /> The option you choose will affect the behavior of the show list control. More information: [Show list behavior](#show-list-behavior) |  
||**Entity**|Depending on the option you choose for **Records**, this list displays either:<br /><br /> - **Only Related Records**: A list of entities that are related to this entity with the name of the lookup field on that entity which defines the relationship in parentheses.<br />- **All Record Types**: A list of all entities.|  
||**Default View**|Choose the view that will be applied by default. If you do not enable any other views using the **View Selector** property. This will be the only view.<br /><br /> Use the **Edit** button to open the default view for editing. Use the **New** button to create a new view to use for this sub-grid.|  
||**Display Search Box**|Display the search box. When this option is chosen the **Display Label on the Form** option is required.|  
||**Display Index**|Only forms using the [Classic forms](main-form-presentations.md#classic-forms) support display index.<br /><br /> Select this check box if you want the alphabetical index to be available with the list. This lets you jump to records starting with a particular letter or number.|  
||**View Selector**|You have three options:<br /><br /> - **Off**: Only the default view can be used.<br />- **Show All Views**: Allow people to choose any view.<br />- **Show Selected Views**: Use the Ctrl key with your cursor to select which of the available views to show.|

||**Availability**|Specify whether the section should be available on phone.|
|**Formatting**|**Layout**|**Select the number of columns the control occupies**.<br /><br /> When the section containing the sub-grid has more than one column you can set the field to occupy up to the number of columns that the section has.|  
||**Row Layout**|**Number of Rows** will determine how many records are shown on a page of a sub-grid.<br /><br /> If **Automatically expand to use available space** is chosen the form will allow space for two records and will expand the space as the number of records increases. If the number exceeds the **Number of Rows**, people can navigate to additional pages to view the records.<br /><br /> If **Automatically expand to use available space** is not chosen the form will provide space for the number of records defined by **Number of Rows** and people can navigate to additional pages to view any additional records.|  
|**Controls**|**Controls**|Choose to add controls and select the radio button to have them for Web, Phone or Tablet.|
  
 In forms using the [Classic forms](main-form-presentations.md#classic-forms), actions performed on a sub-grid were available in the ribbon. Developers can customize the behavior of these actions or add additional actions by customizing the ribbon.  
  
 In forms using the [Updated forms](main-form-presentations.md#updated-forms) actions for sub-grids are placed near the sub-grid, making them easier to access. However the command bar does not allow for custom actions to be added. Developers can edit the ribbon to modify the actions for the remaining three actions: show list, add record, and delete record.  
  

## Show list behavior  
 When displaying a list in forms with the [Updated forms](main-form-presentations.md#updated-forms), each sub-grid displays the **Open View** button ![Open view button](media/crm-itpro-cust-openview.PNG "Open view button") in the top right corner when the entity is also displayed as one of the entities included in the navigation area of the form editor. Choosing this button will open the view. The behavior will change depending on the option chosen for the **Records** property.  
  
 When you select **Only Related Records** the view will open using one of the associated views in the same window. To return to the form, use the back button or choose the current record primary name value in the navigation bar.  
  
 When you select **All Record Types** the view will open in a new window.  

## Add record behavior  
 When displaying a list in forms with the [Updated forms](main-form-presentations.md#updated-forms), each sub-grid displays the **Add record** button ![Add button](media/crm-itpro-cust-subgridadd.PNG "Add button") in the top right side of the sub-grid. Choosing this button will allow you to add a record. This behavior will change depending on the option chosen for the **Records** property and if the lookup is for activity records.  
  
 When you select **Only Related Records** the default behavior is the behavior to add existing records. People see an in-line lookup to search for an existing record first. This helps prevent creating duplicate records.  If they can't find an existing record, they can choose the **New** option. When a new record is created any of the field mappings defined in the relationship will be applied. More information: [Map entity fields](../common-data-service/map-entity-fields.md)   
  
 When you select **All Record Types** the default behavior is to add a new record. The quick create form will be shown if the target entity has one. If not, the default entity main form is shown.  
  
 If the sub-grid displays activities, people will first need to choose the type of activity and then they will see the "add new record" behavior.  
  
## Delete record behavior  
 When you select a record in a sub-grid the **Delete** button ![Sublist delete icon](media/crm-itpro-cust-subgriddelete.PNG "Sublist delete icon") appears on the right side of the row. The behavior of this delete action is different depending on the type of relationship with the current entity.  
  
 When the sub-grid uses a 1:N (one-to-many) relationship, the normal record delete behavior is to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the record.  
  
 When the sub-grid uses a N:N (many-to-many) relationship, the record in the relationship (or intersect) entity relating to two records is deleted without a confirmation and the record will no longer be displayed in the sub-grid. But the record that was displayed is not deleted.
