# Change model-driven app custom entity icons 

When you create a custom entity, it is automatically assigned a default icon. All custom entities use the same icon by default. Use custom icons to differentiate how your custom entities look. You canâ€™t modify the icons assigned to system entities.  
  
 You can upload three types of entity icons for each custom entity. 

|Icon Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Unified Interface Icon**|Must be a scalable vector graphic (.svg) icon |
|**Icon in Web application**|An .svg, .gif, .png, or .jpg format image, 16x16 pixels in size.|
|**Icon for entity forms**|An .svg, .gif, .png, or .jpg format image, 32x32 pixels in size.|

> [!NOTE]
> All image files must be no more than 10 kilobytes in size.
>
> When you use a scalable vector graphic (.svg) image as the **Icon in Web application** or **Icon for entity forms**, it must have the default size set. Since SVG is an XML document, you can edit the [svg](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg) element [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/width) and [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/height) values with a text editor to define the default size for the image.

Each type of icon is stored as a Web Resource. You can create the web resources first and then set the icons to use them, or you can create the new web resource within the **Lookup Record** dialog by selecting **New** while setting the value. More information: [Create or edit web resources to extend an app](create-edit-web-resources.md)

## Set the icons for a custom entity.

You must use solution explorer to set entity icons.

1. From the Power Apps portal select **Solutions**, and then on the toolbar, select **Switch to classic**.

2. In the **All Solutions** list select the unmanaged solution you want.

3. Open the custom entity where you want to update the icon.

### Set entity icons

1. On the command bar, select **Update Icons**.  
  
2. In the **Select New Icons** dialog box, in the **Web Client** tab, under **Icon in Web application** or **Icon for Entity Forms**, to the right of **New Icon**, select the **Browse** button ![Lookup button](media/lookup-button-4.gif).
3. Select or create the appropriate web resource, and then select **OK**. 
4. In the **Unified Interface** tab, do the same for the **New Icon** field.
5. Select **OK** to close the **Select New Icons** dialog
6. On the command bar, on the **File** menu, select **Save**.  
7. When your changes are complete, publish them. Select **Publish** in the command bar while the entity is selected in solution explorer.
