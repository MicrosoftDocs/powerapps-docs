# Create a model-driven app site map using the site map designer



## Site maps overview

Site maps define the manner by which users move between tables in a model-driven app. This is called **navigation**. App navigation is a fundamental aspect of the user experience when performing tasks within the app.

To understand site maps it helps to introduce some concepts, so that you can understand the relationship between the site map designer and the way users intend to use the app.

The screenshot below illustrates a number of features.

1. An **Area**.  Model-driven apps can have multiple areas. Users toggle between these to access different groups.
2. A **Group**.  Areas can have multiple groups. Essentially these allow you to group tables, custom pages, and other components, in a logical fashion.
3. A **Table (or entity)**.  This allows users to see views of the tables that have been selected in the app designer.

This hierarchical structure is important to enable a good user experience, and the terminology used allows better understanding of the app designer.

## Viewing an app from within the app designer

The same app viewed from within the site map designer shows the corresponding areas, groups and tables.  In this case you are viewing tables within the accounts **Group** and groups within the accounts **Area**.  You can also notice there is another area called **Tasks** that also exists within the app designer.

:::image type="content" source="media/site-map-designer-demo.png" alt-text="Viewing an app from withing the site map designer":::

## Prerequisites for editing site maps

Users need to have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions. Specifically, any user with the following privileges can also create apps:  

- Create, Read, and Write privileges for the App table.
- Read and Write privileges for the Customizations table.
- Read privileges for the Solution table.

These privileges can be viewed or set on the **Customization** tab of a security role.

## How to build a site map

In this tutorial several site map tasks are carried out such as creating a new site map, and adding an area, group, and subarea.
  
The site map designer also lets an app designer define the area, subarea, or group titles in the languages supported by the environment.  
  
A default site map is created automatically as part of the a model driven app creation process. This can be edited by using the site map designer.
  
## Create a site map for an app  
  
1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Select **Solutions**, open the solution you want.
1. Select **New** - **App** - **Model-driven app**.
1. From the two options available select **Classic App Designer**.
1. On the app designer canvas, in the **Site Map** area, select the pencil icon![Open Site Map Designer button.](media/dynamics365-open-designer.PNG "Open Site Map Designer button")next to **Site Map** to **Open the Site Map Designer** .  

   ![Open the site map designer.](media/app-designer-sitemap-location.png "Open the site map designer")
  
    The site map designer opens a canvas that is prepopulated with one area, one group, and one subarea. Select the area, group, or subarea tile to change its properties.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Selecting **Open the Site Map Designer** ![Open Site Map Designer button.](media/dynamics365-open-designer.PNG "Open Site Map Designer button") from the app designer canvas automatically creates a new site map (if there's no existing site map), and gives the new site map the same name as the app name and the same unique name as the app unique name. 

1.  [Add an area to the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddArea).  
  
1.  [Add a group to the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddGroup).  
  
1. [Add a subarea to a group in the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddSubarea).  
  
1. Select **Save**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The new site map is associated with the app when returning to the app designer and select **Save**. When a site map is configured, **Configured** appears on the site map tile; otherwise **Not Configured** appears on the tile.  If you open the site map designer from the app designer and configure a new site map, but close the browser before associating the site map with the app, the site map will be automatically associated with the app the next time the app designer is opened, based on the app unique name.  
  
1. Select **Publish**.  
  
## Review the model-driven app

From that app designer select **Save** > **Validate** > **Play**. This runs the app with the latest changes and is an important part of the app building process.

<a name="bkmk_AddArea"></a>   
## Add an area to the site map  
  
1.  Select **Add** ![Add button on the designer.](media/dynamics365-designer-addbutton.PNG "Add button on the designer") on the site map designer canvas, and then select **Area**.  
  
     or  
  
     From the **Components** tab, drag the **Area** tile to the empty box on the canvas. An empty box is visible you move the tile the correct place on the canvas.  
  
2.  Select the area that has just been added. The **Properties** tab highlighted in the pane to the right of the canvas.  
  
3.  Add or edit the area properties.  
  
     Under **General**, do the following:  
  
    - **Title**: Enter the title for the area in the base language of the organization.  
  
    - **Icon**: A default application icon is selected. Select a different icon for the area from the list of web resources available in the solution.  
  
    - **ID**: A unique ID is automatically generated, but different one can be entered if required. It is best practice to use the provided ID because if the ID entered is not unique, users might get an error when they're using the app, or app designers may get an error when importing a solution that contains this site map.  
  
    - **Show Groups**: Select this check box to show groups of subareas in the navigation pane.  
  
     Under **Advanced**, do the following:  
  
    - **More Titles**: If your organization uses multiple languages, select a language (Locale) for the title, enter the title, and then select **Add** ![Add button in the site map designer.](media/add-icon-sitemap-designer.png "Add button in the site map designer"). Titles can be created, edited, or deleted for as many languages as your organization uses. However, it is only possible to have one title per language.  
  
    - **More Description**: If an organization uses multiple languages, select a language for the description, enter the description, and then select **Add** ![Add button in the site map designer.](media/add-icon-sitemap-designer.png "Add button in the site map designer"). Descriptions can be created, edited, or deleted for as many languages as your organization uses. However, it is only possible to have one description per language.  
  
    - **URL**: Enter the URL to render for the Dynamics 365 for Outlook folder that represents the area.  
  
## Creating and editing Groups, Subareas and Areas

The following sections provide instructions describing how to work with Groups, Subareas, and Areas in addition to reviewing their properties.

<a name="bkmk_AddGroup"></a>   
## Add a group to the site map  
  
1.  On the site map designer canvas, select the area you want to add the group to.  
2.  Select **Add** ![Add button on the designer.](media/dynamics365-designer-addbutton.PNG "Add button on the designer"), and then select **Group**.  
  
     or

2.  Select the subarea that has just been added.  
  
3.  On the **Properties** tab, add or edit the subarea properties:  
  
     Under **General**, do the following:  
  
    - **Type**: Select whether the subarea being adding is a dashboard, table, web resource, or URL.  
  
    - **Entity**: Select the table that the subarea is for. This column is disabled if the subarea type is other than **Entity** in the **Type** drop-down list.  
  
    - **URL**: Specify a URL to a web page. The URL text displays from this subarea and, when selected, a new browser window opens that displays the page. This column is disabled if **Entity** in the **Type** is selected in the drop-down list.  
 
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Site map subarea URLs that link to an .aspx page aren’t supported.
 
    - **Default Dashboard**: Select the default dashboard to be displayed for this subarea. This column is disabled if **Dashboard** has not been selected in the **Type** drop-down list.  
  
    - **Title**: Enter the title for the subarea in the base language of the organization.  
  
    - **Icon**: A default application icon is selected. Select a different icon for the subarea from the list of web resources available in the solution.  
  
    - **ID**. A unique ID is automatically generated. Enter a different unique ID if necessary.  
  
    - **Parameter Passing**. Select this check box to pass information about the organization and language context to the URL. This check box is checked only when the subarea type is a web resource or a URL-based subarea.  
  
     Under **Advanced**, do the following:  
 
    - **Privileges**: This defines whether a subarea is displayed based on privileges available in any security roles that are assigned to the user. Select the name of the table to check privileges for, and then select the check boxes to assign privileges.
  
    - **More Titles**: If your organization uses multiple languages, select a language for the title, enter the title for the subarea, and then select **Add**. Titles can be created, edited, or deleted for as many languages as your organization uses. However, it is only possible to have one title per language.  
  
    - **More Descriptions**: If your organization uses multiple languages, select a language for the description, enter the description for the subarea, and then select **Add**. Descriptions can be created, edited, or deleted for as many languages as your organization uses. However, it is only possible to have one description per language.  
  
    - **SKUs**: Select the versions of Dynamics 365 that display this subarea.  
  
    - **Client**: Select the type of client that displays this subarea.  
  
    - **Outlook Shortcut**: Select the icon to display in Dynamics 365 for Outlook.  
  
    - **Offline Availability**: Select this check box to make this subarea available to users when they are offline in Dynamics 365 for Outlook.  
<a name="bkmk_OrganizeSite"></a>  
## Organize areas, groups, and subareas

 Organize areas, groups, and subareas by dragging them to new positions. A container box appears where you can drop the tiles. Here are some options:  
  
-   Move a subarea to a new position within the same group or a different group under the same area.  
  
-   Move a subarea to a new position within a group under a different area.  
  
-   Move a group to a new position within the same area.  
  
-   Move a group to a new position in a different area.  
  
-   Move an area to a new position.  

## Edit the default site map

 Each environment comes with a default site map and this can be edited.  
  
1. Open solution explorer.  
  
2. In the solution window, under **Components**, select **Client Extensions**.  

3. On the component toolbar, select **Add Existing** > **Site Map**.

4. In the list of solution components, select the site map named **Site Map**, and then select **OK**.
  
5.  Double-click to select the site map added that has the display name **Site Map** and is in a **Managed** state. The site map can be selected, and then on the toolbar, select **Edit**.  
  
     The site map opens in the site map designer.  
6.  [Add an area to the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddArea).  
7.  [Add a group to the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddGroup).  
8.  [Add a subarea to a group in the site map](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_AddSubarea).
9.  [Rearrange your areas, groups and subareas as required](create-site-map-app.md#bkmk_OrganizeSite).
10. Select **Save**.  
11. Select **Publish**.
12. Select **Save and Close**.

## Clone a component in a site map  
 To make a copy of an existing component, select the component, and then on the toolbar, select **Clone**.  All details of the cloned component are same as the base component except the ID and title. The ID is generated randomly.
  
 When an area is cloned, the cloned area is added to the right of the currently selected area. When a group is cloned, the cloned group is added to the right of the currently selected group. When a subarea is cloned, the cloned subarea is added below the currently selected subarea.  
  
## Delete an area, group, or subarea from a site map  
 To delete a site map component, select the component tile, and then on the toolbar, select **Delete**. When an area is deleted, all groups and subareas in the area are also deleted. Similarly, when a group is deleted, the group and subareas in it are deleted.
