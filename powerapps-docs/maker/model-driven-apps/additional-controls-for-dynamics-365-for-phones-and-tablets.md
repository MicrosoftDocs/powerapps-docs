# List of controls available for model-driven apps

Controls allow app users to visualize data within table columns in addition to enabling interaction with them.

Controls exist to provide a more touch-friendly experience with model-driven apps. These include toggle, star rating, calendar, number input, and other controls.

Most controls are configured for a table column, but some controls, like the grid controls can be configured for the table.

## Using controls in the form designer

To use these controls in the form designer:  
  
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Select **Tables** on the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. Select the required table and then select the **Forms** area.
1. Select the [main form](model-driven-app-glossary.md#main-form) to be edited.
1. Select the column or section where you want to add the control.

1. In the right properties pane, select **+ Component** to display the available controls, and then select the control you want.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Different controls are available depending on the column or grid type. For example, star rating controls are only available for whole number columns.
  
1. Select the devices (web, tablet, and phone) you want the control to appear on.  
  
1. Configure the values for each property.  
  
1. Select **Done** when youâ€™re done configuring the control.  
  
Following are descriptions for each control you can use on forms.  

## Grid controls

Grid controls can be configured at the following levels: 
- Table. When a grid control is configured for a table, all views for the table will use the grid control. More information: [Configure a grid control for a table](#configure-a-grid-control-for-a-table)
- Form. Subgrids added to a form use a grid control to control the behavior of the subgrid.

### Subgrid

The read-only subgrid allows you to present a view of data related to the current record where users can view and open the record from within the grid. More information: [Add and configure a subgrid component on a form](form-designer-add-configure-subgrid.md)

### Editable grid

With editable grids, users can do rich in-line editing of records directly from views and subgrids whether they're using a web app, tablet, or phone. More information: [Make model-driven app grids (lists) editable using the editable grid control](make-grids-lists-editable-custom-control.md)

### Power Apps grid control (preview)

The Power Apps grid control represents the next evolution of the Power Apps grid control, allowing users to view, open, and edit records from views and subgrids. By default, the Power Apps grid control is read-only but you can configure it to be editable.
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
>
> - The Power Apps grid control currently can only be configured for a table.

More information: [Power Apps grid control](the-power-apps-grid-control.md)

### Configure a grid control for a table

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Open [solution explorer](advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer), expand **Entities**, and then select the table you want, such as the account table.
1. Select the **Controls** tab, and then select the grid you want for the table.
1. Depending on the grid control, specify the values you want, **Save** and then **Publish** the customization.

## Display controls

### Calendar

The Calendar control control displays scheduled activities and their associated details in a calendar. You can view, create, and delete your activities in a day, week, or month view. More information: [Add the calendar control to tables](add-calendar-control.md)

### Canvas app

An embedded canvas app includes rich data integration capabilities that bring in contextual data from the host model-driven form to the embedded canvas app. Display the data you want from a variety of sources right next to data from Microsoft Dataverse. More information: [Add an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form](embedded-canvas-app-add-classic-designer.md)

### External website

Add inline frames (iframes) to a form to integrate content from another website within the form. More information: [Add an iframe to a model-driven app main form](iframe-properties-legacy.md)

### HTML and image web resource

Display an HTML page or image file on a form via a web resource. More information: [View and edit a web resource on a form](web-resource-properties-legacy.md#view-and-edit-a-web-resource-on-a-form)

### Knowledge search

Requires Dynamics 365 Customer Service app. Add a Knowledge Base Search control to a form to make it easy for users in your organization to find knowledge articles so they can answer common customer questions and resolve their issues right from the records, without having to switch to a different application. More information: [Add the Knowledge Base Search control to forms](/dynamics365/customer-service/add-knowledge-base-search-control-forms)

### Quick view

The quick view control displays data from a row that is selected in a lookup on the form. The data displayed in the control is defined using a quick view form. The data displayed is not editable, but when the primary column is included in the quick view form, it becomes a link to open the related row. More information: [Model-driven app quick view control properties](quick-view-control-properties-legacy.md)

### Timeline control

Provide a timeline of recent, relevant news articles and Twitter tweets for an account. More information: [Set up the timeline control](set-up-timeline-control.md)

More information: [Edit related table records directly from another tableâ€™s main form](form-component-control.md)

### Collaboration controls

Collaboration controls give you the power to simplify your userâ€™s workflow collaboration.
