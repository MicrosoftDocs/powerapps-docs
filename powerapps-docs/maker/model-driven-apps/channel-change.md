# Changing release channels for model-driven apps

The release channel affects the features that are shown to a user. When the monthly channel is enabled for an environment, makers need to validate that their customizations work with each monthly release. This article describes different approaches for a maker to change channels and validate an upcoming release..

## Flexible channel configuration

The release channel for model-driven apps can be changed in a couple different ways.

- Environment channel
- Browser session channel

> [!NOTE]
> - When the release channel is changed on the environment level, a user must refresh the browser tab twice to update the release channel information. The first refresh triggers a background update of feature configuration to a local cache. The second refresh uses the feature configuration local cache.
> - The browser session channel can be applied using a URL parameter, which is a temporary override.

## Changing the environment channel

The environment channel can be set using the Power Platform admin center or with code.

Power Platform admins can change the release channel using the environment's behavior settings. More information: [Manage behavior settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-behavior).

Developers can change the release channel by updating the [ReleaseChannel](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/organization#BKMK_ReleaseChannel) column value for the row in the [Organization](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/organization) table. There's always a single row in the organization table.
More information:

* [Update a record using the SDK for .NET](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/org-service/entity-operations-update-delete?tabs=late#basic-update)

## Changing the browser session channel

A single browser session can be changed by adding the URL parameter ```&channel=<channelname>```. This URL parameter is used for all navigation within the browser tab. It might not be copied to a new browser tab.

| Channel | URL parameter |
| --- | --- |
| Semi-annual | ```&channel=semiannual``` |
| Monthly | ```&channel=monthly``` |

When the channel is monthly, the monthly release can be changed using the URL parameter ```&channelrelease=<releasename>```. Starting with build 23074, the release name format is the two digit year and two digit month, like *YYMM*. Prior to build 23074, the release name is a three letter month and four digit year, like *MmmYYYY*.

| Monthly Release | Release Name Parameter |
| --- | --- |
| July 2023 | ```&channelrelease=2307``` |  
| August 2023 | ```&channelrelease=2308``` |  
| September 2023 | ```&channelrelease=2309``` |  

> [!NOTE]
> Any valid ```YYMM``` release can be entered but future dates might not have any features defined.  

## Validating the next monthly release

Validation should be done for each monthly channel release before it's automatically enabled for users. Users can test when the validation build version has reached the environment.

1. Find the current monthly release a model-driven app by selecting **Settings** > **About**. The release version follows **Channel: Monthly** and is a date like *July 2023*.

1. Find the next monthly release short name by opening [Unified Interface monthly channel releases](/power-platform/released-versions/common-data-service/unified-interface-monthly-releases)

1. Add the URL parameter ```&channelrelease=``` with the next release short name like *2308*.

## Comparing features across channels and releases

When a user running the monthly channel report observes unexpected behavior, the following steps can help investigate where the behavior occurred.

- Check if the unexpected behavior exists in the semi-annual channel by using the URL parameter ```&channel=semiannual```. If the behavior also exists in the semi-annual channel, it's unrelated to the monthly channel and should follow normal support processes.
- Check if the unexpected behavior exists in the previous monthly release by using the URL parameter ```&channelrelease=``` with the prior release short name like *Jun2023*. If the two monthly releases behave the same, then it's likely unrelated to a specific monthly channel release and should follow normal support processes.
- When a change is noticed between monthly releases, review the changed features in [Unified Interface monthly channel releases](/power-platform/released-versions/common-data-service/unified-interface-monthly-releases) to learn more.
