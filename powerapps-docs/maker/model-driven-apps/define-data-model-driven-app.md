# Define data for your model-driven app

Data for your model-driven app is defined in [Microsoft Dataverse](../data-platform/data-platform-intro.md). 

You define your app data using the following components: *table*, *column*, and *relationship*.

For detailed information about working with these components in Dataverse to define data for your model-driven app, see the following topics under Dataverse section:

|Component |Topic|
|-----|----|
|Table| [Work with tables](../data-platform/entity-overview.md)|
|Column| [Work with columns](../data-platform/fields-overview.md)|
|Relationships| [Work with relationships](../data-platform/relationships-overview.md)|
