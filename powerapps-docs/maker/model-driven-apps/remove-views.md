# Delete or deactivate a model-driven app view 

<a name="BKMK_RemoveViews"></a>   

 You may have a view that you don’t want people to see. Depending on the type of view, you can either delete it or deactivate it.  
  
## Delete a view  
 You can delete any custom public view. Use the steps in [Access view definitions](accessing-view-definitions.md) to find the view you want to delete and use the ![Delete button](media/delete.gif "Delete button")**Delete** command. Once you verify that you really want to delete it, the view will be permanently deleted.  
  
 If you don’t want to delete the view permanently, you can deactivate it instead.  
  
## Deactivate or activate views  
 You cannot delete or deactivate any [system views](create-edit-views.md#system-views), including public views the system created. You can deactivate any public view, including public views the system created.  
  
### Deactivate or activate a public view  
  
1.  Navigate to **System Views** as described in [Access view definitions](accessing-view-definitions.md).  
  
2.  Select a public view. To see inactive views, use the **Inactive Public Views** view.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, select **More Actions**, and then select either **Deactivate** or **Activate**.  
  
4.  Select **Publish All Customizations**.
