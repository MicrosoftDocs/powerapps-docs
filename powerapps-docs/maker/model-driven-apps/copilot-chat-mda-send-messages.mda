# Send message to Copilot chat in model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Extend your app's Copilot chat engagement and impact by incorporating rich audio, video and simple cards response type. The Message node, within the flow of a topic, sends a message from the agent to the user. Messages can be simple text messages, but can also include richer components, such as images, videos, quick replies, and cards.
