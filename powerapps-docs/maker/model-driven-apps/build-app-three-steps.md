# Build an app in three steps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This interactive experience guides new makers through the creation of a model-driven app. Using the modern app designer, anyone can quickly create an app in three simple steps.

In this experience you...

1. Name your app.
1. Create a page and add the preselected table to the page.
1. Publish and play your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature. More information: [Preview program for portals, model-driven apps and app management](../powerapps-preview-program.md#portals-model-driven-apps-and-app-management)

## How it works

You'll see the **Make an app in just five minutes** banner on the Power Apps home page of your environment when these conditions are true:

* You have permission to create a Microsoft Dataverse database in the environment.
* You haven't yet created and saved an app in the environment.

Makers who donâ€™t meet these conditions can experience this feature in a preview environment by adding this parameter to the end of the make.preview.powerapps.com URL: `?cdsCommon.forcePowerAppsFirstRunTour=true`
