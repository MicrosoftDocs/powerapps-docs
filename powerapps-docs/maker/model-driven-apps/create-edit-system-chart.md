# Create a model-driven app system chart

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

In this article you learn how to create a system chart. System charts are organization-owned charts, which makes them available to anyone with access to read the data running the app. System charts can't be assigned or shared with specific app users.

1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Apps**.

1. Next to the model driven app to which you want to edit by adding a chart, select **...** (ellipses), and then select **Edit**. <!--In this example, we use the **Manage Customers** app used in the tutorial *How to create a model driven app*. -->
1. In the app designer, locate the table to which you want to add the chart, and then select the corresponding **Charts** tile. In this example, we add a chart to the **Account** table.

1. On the **Components** tab, select **Create New**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven apps/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven-apps-2.png" alt-text="On the Components tab pane select Create New.":::

   A new window opens where you can create a chart.

1. Specify the type of chart, and how the data is displayed in the chart.

   - Enter the chart name, such as *Number of employees by account*.
   - In the **Select Column** dropdowns:
      -  In the **Legend Entries (Series)** dropdown list select a column, such as **Number of Employees**.
      - In the **Horizonal (Category) Axis** dropdown list select a column, such as **Account Name**.

   -   Add a description to identify the purpose of the chart, such as *This column chart displays the number of employees by account name*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven apps/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven-apps-3.png" alt-text="Description to identify the purpose of the system chart you create.":::

1. Select **Save and Close**.

The **Number of employees by account** chart is now displayed in the app designer list of charts available for the account table.

## View your visualization in your model-driven app

Now that you have created your chart, you can use it to visualize account data in your app. Follow these steps to view your chart:

1. In the app designer, select **Play**.

   The app launches.

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Accounts**.

1. On the command bar, select **Show Chart**.

   The chart pane opens.

1. Select the chart selector, and then select **Number of employees by account**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven apps/view-your-visualization-in-your-model-driven-app-1.png" alt-text="Chart selector.":::


   Your chart appears in-line with the data view.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-and-customize-visualizations-in-model-driven apps/view-your-visualization-in-your-model-driven-app-2.png" alt-text="Your system chart named Number of employees by account is displayed.":::

Use your chart:
- Select a bar on the chart to filter the data in the view.
- Refresh the chart to display other data by changing the view.
- Add the chart to a model-driven app dashboard. More information: [Create or edit model-driven app dashboards](create-edit-dashboards.md)

## Known issue

In the chart designer, adding a order by on certain calculated columns are not supported and will cause an error. The calculated columns causing this are using another calculated columns, a related table column, or a local column on the table.
