# Create a model-driven app with the app designer

In this article, you learn the basics of how to create a model-driven app that can be shared and distributed to other environments.

## Prerequisites

Verify the availability of the following prerequisites before you start to create a model-driven app:

- A Power Platform environment used for app development.
- An environment maker, system administrator, or system customizer security role.

For more information, go to the following articles:

- [Create an environment](/power-platform/admin/create-environment).
- [Environment strategy for ALM](/power-platform/alm/environment-strategy-alm).
- [About predefined security roles](share-model-driven-app.md#about-predefined-security-roles).

## Create an app

1. On the [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) **Home** page, select **Solutions** from the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

1. Open an unmanaged solution or [create a new solution](../data-platform/create-solution.md).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Unmanaged solutions can be identified when the solution has a **No** in the **Managed** column.
   > 
   > Although the **Default Solution** is an unmanaged solution, it is in most circumstances not recommended to create or edit customizations in the default solution.

1. Select **New** > **App** > **Model-driven app**.
1. On the **New model-driven app** dialog box, enter a **Name** and optionally, a **Description**, and then select **Create**.
1. On the command bar select **Add page**, and then on the **New page** screen, select **Dataverse table**, and then select **Next**.
1. From the list of tables, select **Account**, select **Contact**, and then select **Add**.

On the **Pages** left pane, under **Navigation** the layout for the app is displayed.

Notice the preview pane displays your app. Selecting a component, such as the **Accounts form**, affects what's displayed in the preview and property panes. If your environment includes data that you have access to view, that also appears in the preview.

To save and publish the app, select **Save**, and then select **Publish**.

To see how the app runs in a full browser window, on the command bar, select **Play**.
