# Create a model-driven app with the app designer

In this article, you learn the basics of how to create a model-driven app that can be shared and distributed to other environments.

## Prerequisites

Verify the availability of the following prerequisites before you start to create a model-driven app:

- A Power Platform environment used for app development.
- An environment maker, system administrator, or system customizer security role.

For more information, go to the following articles:

- [Create an environment](/power-platform/admin/create-environment).
- [Environment strategy for ALM](/power-platform/alm/environment-strategy-alm).
- [About predefined security roles](share-model-driven-app.md#about-predefined-security-roles).

## Create an app

1. On the [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) **Home** page, select **Solutions** from the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

1. Open an unmanaged solution or [create a new solution](../data-platform/create-solution.md)
   > [!NOTE]   
   > Unmanaged solutions can be recognized by the open lock in the **Managed Externally?** column.
   > :::image type="content" source="media/unmanaged-solutions.png" alt-text="Viewing solutions within an environment":::
   > Although the **Default Solution** is an unmanaged solution, it is in most circumstances not recommended to create or edit customizations in the default solution.
1. Select **New** > **App** > **Model-driven app**.
1. On the **New model-driven app** dialog box, enter a **Name** and optionally, a **Description**, and then select **Create**.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Navigation** to display the navigation tree.

   > [!TIP]
   > Use the menu toggle to show or hide the names of the menu options. :::image type="content" source="media/menu-toggle.png" alt-text="Toggle the menu to show or hide the name of the menu options":::
1. Notice that a basic navigation structure is already created for you. Expand **Area1**, and then expand **Group1**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/default-site-map.png" alt-text="Default site map is created for you":::
1. Select **Group1** and change the title in the property pane to, for example, *Accounts and Contacts*. :::image type="content" source="media/edit-navigation-group-title.png" alt-text="edit the group's title in the property pane":::
1. Select **Subarea1**, and make changes such as the following:

   - **Content type**: Table
   - **Table**: Account
   - **Title**: Accounts

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - A subarea won't appear in the app preview until you add a content type to it.
   > - By default, all forms and views are included for a table that's added to a page. To remove one or more components, see [Create, add, and remove forms, views, or dashboards](create-add-remove-forms-views-dashboards.md).

1. On the command bar, select **New page**, select **Table based view and form**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **New table view and form pages** dialog box, select **Contact**, leave the **Show in navigation** option selected, and then select **Add**. Note the following: 
   - Notice the preview pane displays your app. Selecting a component, such as a table, affects what's displayed in the preview. If your environment includes data that you have access to view, that also appears in the preview.
   :::image type="content" source="media/create-app.png" alt-text="App created with account and contact tables.":::
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Publish**.

To see how the app runs in a full browser window, on the command bar, select **Play**.
