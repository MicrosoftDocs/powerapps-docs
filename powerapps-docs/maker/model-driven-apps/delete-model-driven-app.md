# Delete a model-driven app

## Why apps need to be deleted

Apps may need to be deleted for a variety of reasons. An app might have been prepared purely as a development training exercise, may no longer be used in the organization, or may have been superseded in some way.

The process for removing an app is straightforward. However, it is worth noting that dependencies can be encountered when you delete components in Dataverse.  While deleting apps can be done at any time in an unmanaged solution, it is not possible to delete tables that are used in the apps until such time as the app has been removed. The same is true for other app components, such as table views.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If a model-driven app or site map was installed in the default solution as part of a managed solution, see [Delete a model-driven app that was installed as part of a managed solution](#delete-a-model-driven-app-that-was-installed-as-part-of-a-managed-solution).
> - First party model-driven apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Dynamics 365 Field Service canâ€™t be deleted. You can hide these apps from users by removing the security roles that are assigned to the app. Notice that these apps will still be visible to users with environment maker, system administrator, and system customizer roles or any user with create privileges on the Model-driven App table. 

## Delete or remove an app in your environment

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. On the left navigation, select **Apps**.
> [!note]
> Customizations to a table should take place within a [solution](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#solution). To update a model-driven app within a solution, open your solution.
3. Select the app that you want to delete, and then select **Delete** on the command bar.
4. In the confirmation message that appears there are two options.  
   - **Remove solution** will remove the app from the solution, but retain it within the environment.
   - **Delete from this environment** will delete it from both the solution and the environment.

   If the component has dependencies, such as relationships, these must be removed before the app can be deleted. To see the dependencies of an app, select the app and then select **Show Dependencies** on the command bar.

When an app is deleted, you should also delete the associated site map. If this is not deleted, the site map designer displays an error the first time there is an attempt to create another app with the same name. However, it is possible to ignore the error, and the error will not appear when trying to create the app again.

## Delete a model-driven app that was installed as part of a managed solution

It is not possible to delete a model-driven app or site map that was installed in the environment as part of a managed solution.  Instead, the managed solution must be deleted.

## Delete a managed solution

All the components of a managed solution are deleted by deleting the solution.

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when you delete a managed solution because the solution might contain components that are used for production purposes, such as a line of business application. All solution components will be deleted and any data associated with the managed solution will also be deleted.

1.	Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2.	On the left navigation, select **Solutions**.
3.	In the **Solutions** list, select the relevant managed solution then on the toolbar select **Delete**.
