# Using the tree view in the form designer
The **Tree View** pane displays a visual hierarchy of the components on the form. The icons in the tree view help you quickly identify the type of column or component. 

You can also use the tree view to select columns and components present on the form. The tree view is helpful when you want to select hidden elements that are not visible on the form preview. 

You can expand or collapse nodes in the tree view to see or hide the elements within a node. When you select an element in the tree view, it becomes highlighted in the form preview, and the property pane displays the properties for the element.

### Open the tree view 
1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. 
    - More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the left pane, select **Tree view**.
