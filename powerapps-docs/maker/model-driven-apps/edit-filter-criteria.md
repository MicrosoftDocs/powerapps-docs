# Edit filter criteria and change sort order in model-driven app views

<a name="BKMK_EditFilterCriteria"></a>   

Along with the columns displayed in a view, the filter criteria applied to a view is a critical part of the value provided by the view.  
  
1.  When you create or edit the view in the view designer, in the right **Common Tasks** pane select **Edit Filter Criteria**.  
  
2.  The dialog shows a user interface similar to **Advanced Find**. You can use **AND** and **OR** clauses to specify and group criteria by selecting the filter claus and then selecting **Group AND** or **Group OR**.  

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
  > ![Edit filter criteria](media/edit-filter-criteria.png)
  
3.  Select **OK** to save and close the **Edit Filter Criteria** dialog box.  
  
 For more information about constructing filter clauses, see [Create, edit, or save an Advanced Find search](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/save-advanced-find-search).
