# Edit filter criteria for a table view



<a name="BKMK_EditFilterCriteria"></a>   

Along with the [columns](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#column), displayed in a [view](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#view), the filter criteria applied to a view is a critical part of the value provided by the view. It is possible to add or edit filter criteria and change the sort order for the columns included in a view. If a sort order is not set for a view, by default the view is sorted by the primary column in the view in ascending order (A to Z).

## Edit the filter criteria of a view

1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).  

2.  Expand **Data**, select **Tables**, select the table you want, and then select the **Views** tab.

> [!note]
> Customizations to a table should take place within a [solution](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#solution). To update a table within a solution open your solution from the **Solutions** area, select the table, and then select the **Views** tab.

3.  Select a column, and from the column menu, select **Filter by**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Filter by.](media/edit-filter-criteria.png "Filter by")

4.  Select the conditional operator.

5.  Type or select the comparison value for the condition.

6.  Select **Apply**.

    The filter expressions for a view are shown in the View properties panel.
    
7.  To edit a filter expression, select the filter select expression from the View properties panel.

8.  To remove a filter expression, select the **X** button.

## Work with the filter expression builder

The expression builder in the view designer can be used to add, edit filters, or remove for any columns of the table in the current view or any columns in a related table.

### Edit or remove a filter condition with the expression builder

1. Select a view to open it. The view properties panel lists existing filters.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![View panel filters.](media/views-panel-filters.png "View panel filters")

2. On the view properties panel, select a filter condition.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Edit filters.](media/edit-filter-viewpanel.png "Edit filters")

3. Select the conditional operator.

4. Type or select the comparison value for the condition.

5. Select **Apply**.

6. To remove a condition, select **Close**. The condition is removed without confirmation.

### Work with multiple filter conditions

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add row**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Expression builder.](media/edit-create-filters.png "Expression builder")

2. Select a column for the condition.

3. Select a conditional operator.

4. Select a comparison value.  

    Some filter conditions don't require a comparison value for the condition. For example, the operator **Contains data** doesn't require a comparison value. With other filter conditions, a comparison value must be chosen from an option set. For example, the **Status** column has an option set that contains the values **Active** and **Inactive**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Filter condition.](media/add-condition-filter.png "Filter condition")

5. Select **OK**.

### Add a group condition to a filter

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add group**.

2. Select the relational operator **Or** for the group. **And** is the default relational operator.

3. Specify the first clause of the grouped condition. Select the column, conditional operator, and comparison value.

4. Select **Add** > **Add group**.

5. Specify the second clause of the grouped condition.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Group condition filter.](media/add-group-filter.png "Group condition filter")

    You can select **Collapse** to display the group as a conditional expression.

### Add a related table to a condition

1. In the expression builder, select **Add** > **Add related table**.

2. Select a column from the current table that is related to another table. The table related to the column is shown in parenthesis. You can select columns that have a many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship with the related table.

3. Select a column of the related table for the condition.

4. Select a conditional operator.

5. Select or enter a comparison value.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Related table filter.](media/add-relatedentity-filter.png "Related table filter")

### Group conditions of a filter

1. In the expression builder, select the check box for the conditions where grouping is needed.

2. Select **More commands** (...) for one of the conditions, and then select **Make group**.

3. To ungroup a group, select **More commands** (...) for the group, and then select **Ungroup**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Grouped condition filter.](media/group-conditions-filter.png "Grouped condition filter")


## Use solution explorer to edit filter criteria

### Change the filter criteria for a view.

1.  To create or edit a view in the view designer, in the **Common Tasks** pane, select **Edit Filter Criteria**.  
  
2.  The dialog shows a user interface similar to **Advanced Find**. Use **AND** and **OR** clauses to specify and group criteria by selecting the filter clause and then select **Group AND** or **Group OR**.  

3.  Select **OK** to save and the filter criteria.  
  
For more information about constructing filter clauses, see [Create, edit, or save an Advanced Find search](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/save-advanced-find-search).
