# Customize Copilot chat using Copilot Studio (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Customize Copilot chat to make it even more intelligent and relevant for your organization by adding additional topics, knowledge sources, and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2216214), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

You customize Copilot chat using [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/) and expand the capabilities to go beyond just handling [Microsoft Dataverse tables questions](/power-apps/user/use-copilot-model-driven-apps) and out-of-the-box skills. Before customizing, make sure [Copilot chat is enabled](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-ai-copilot#enable-copilot-for-model-driven-apps-in-your-environment) for your environment.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Copilot Studio license and agent editing permissions are required to customize Copilot chat.
> - This feature is only available in standalone model-driven apps, which don't include both lead and opportunity tables. This feature isn't yet supported for Dynamics 365 apps.

1. Go to https://make.preview.powerapps.com. 
1. Open your model-driven app in edit mode, and then on the left navigation bar select **...** > **Configure in Copilot Studio**. You're taken to Microsoft Copilot Studio where your appâ€™s agent is set up. Every standalone model-driven app Copilot has its own dedicated agent available for customizations. Setting up the agent for the first time takes a few seconds.

1. Customize your agent by adding [knowledge sources](copilot-chat-mda-knowledge.md) or [topics](copilot-chat-mda-topics.md). Customizing this agent only impacts the Copilot chat of the specific app it's provisioned for.

1. **Publish** the agent after you make customizations to ensure changes are available to users.

Power Apps also creates a platform owned environment agent **Copilot in Power Apps** in each environment. This agent is only editable by the environment admin and is not published to any channels by default. However this agent shouldn't be edited since it is not used by model driven apps.
