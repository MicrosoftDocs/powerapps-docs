In this article, a view definition is opened that displays properties and options to configure a table view using the view designer for use with model-driven apps.

## Open a view for editing in Power Apps

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Select **Solutions** on the left navigation pane, and then open the solution that needs to be modified. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)] 
1. Select the table that contains the required view, such as the **Account** table.
1. Select the **Views** area.
1. Select the view, such as the account table **All Accounts** view.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![All Accounts view.](media/account-view-designer.png)

1. From the view editor, the following tasks can be performed:

- [Sort rows in a view](configure-sorting.md)
- [Choose and configure columns in views](choose-and-configure-columns.md)
- [Filtering data within views](create-edit-view-filters.md)
