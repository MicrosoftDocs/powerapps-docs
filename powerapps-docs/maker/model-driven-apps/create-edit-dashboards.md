# Create or edit model-driven app dashboards

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

There are two types of dashboards, user dashboards and system dashboards. An app user can create a dashboard visible only to them in the app areas that they have privileges to. An admin or customizer creates or customizes system dashboards that, when published, are visible to all app users. A user can choose to set their user dashboard as their default dashboard and override the system dashboard.   

Dashboards can be standard or interactive. Standard dashboards support adding one or more unrelated components such as charts or lists. Interactive dashboards provide the capability for users to act on a particular row directly from the dashboard. This topic focuses on standard system dashboards. For information about interactive dashboards, see [Configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards](configure-interactive-experience-dashboards.md).

## Create a new standard dashboard  
  
1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
  
2. Select **Solutions**, and then open the solution you want.

3. On the toolbar select **New**, select **Dashboard**, and then choose a 2, 3, or 4 column layout.  
  
4.  In the **Dashboard: New** page enter a name for the dashboard.  
  
5.  Select one of the component areas and then select the icon for a chart or a list.  
  
     You can have up to six components in the dashboard.  
  
6.  For example, to add a chart, select the chart icon on the tile of the dashboard canvas where you want the chart to appear. Then, in the **Add Component** dialog box select values for **Row Type**, **View**, and **Chart**, and then select **Add** to add the chart to the dashboard. For information about how to create a chart, see [Create a model-driven app system chart](create-edit-system-chart.md).
  
7.  When you are finished adding components to your dashboard, select **Save** and then **Close**.  

8. On the solution toolbar, select **Publish**.

## Edit an existing dashboard  
  
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

2. Select **Solutions**, and then open the solution you want.  

3. In the list of solution components, open the dashboard, select one of the component areas, and then on the toolbar select **Edit Component**.  
  
4.  In the **Set Properties** dialog box, you can make changes to a chart or list such as change the table, default view, add a chart selector, or make the dashboard available on the mobile apps. When you’re done, select **OK**.  
  
     For more information about setting dashboard component properties, see [Set properties for a chart or list included in a dashboard](set-properties-chart-list-included-dashboard.md).  
  
5.  When you’ve completed your changes on the toolbar select **Save**, and then select **Close**. 

6. On the solution toolbar, select **Publish**.  
  
Additional system dashboards tasks you can perform include:  
  
-   Remove a list or chart from a dashboard  

-   Add a list or chart to a dashboard  

-   Set the default dashboard  

-   Use security roles to make a dashboard visible to just certain roles
