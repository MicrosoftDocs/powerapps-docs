# Add a field to a model-driven app form 

If a Power Apps form for a standard entity doesn't meet your organization's business requirements, you can customize the form by changing existing fields or by adding new fields. While it might be simpler to edit the existing fields on a form, sometimes it's better to add a field to address a specific business scenario.

In this topic, you add a field on to a form.   
  
1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).  

2.  Expand **Data**, select **Entities**, select the entity that you want, and then select the **Forms** tab.  

3.  In the list, open a form with the type of **Main** to edit it.  
  
4.  In the form, click the section you want to add a field to, and then in the **Fields** pane, click the field you want added to the form.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  When you add an option set field on the form, the drop-down list that contains the option set values can only display two values. Users must scroll to see more values in the list. If you want to show more than two values without users having to scroll, add one or more **Spacer** controls below the option set field on the form. Each **Spacer** control provides a space for one additional option set value. For example, if you want to display four values in the drop-down list without scrolling, add two **Spacer** controls below the option set field on the form.  
  
5.  To publish customizations for the form that you're editing, with the form open, click **Publish**. 
  
6.  When you're done editing the form, click **Save and Close**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  In the Unified Interface, when you set field level security, we donâ€™t recommend that you set read-only on a required field using field level security rules.  When the record is created, the save pipeline will ignore the read-only setting on the required field and will save the record. We recommend that you set the entity to read-only using role-based security. This helps ensure there is no conflict when creating or saving a record.
  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Publishing customizations can interfere with normal system operation. We recommend that you publish when it's least disruptive to users.
