# Model-driven app quick view control properties

A quick view control on a model-driven app form displays data from a record that is selected in a lookup on the form. The data displayed in the control is defined using a quick view form. The data displayed is not editable, but when the primary field is included in the quick view form, it becomes a link to open the related record. More information: [Create and edit quick view forms](create-edit-quick-view-forms.md)
