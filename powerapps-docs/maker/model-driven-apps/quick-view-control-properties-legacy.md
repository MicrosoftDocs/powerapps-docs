# Model-driven app quick view control properties

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

A quick view control on a model-driven app form displays data from a row that is selected in a lookup on the form. The data displayed in the control is defined using a quick view form. The data displayed is not editable, but when the primary column is included in the quick view form, it becomes a link to open the related row. More information: [Create and edit quick view forms](create-edit-quick-view-forms.md)

|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Name**|**Required**: The unique name for the quick view form that is used when referencing it in scripts.|  
|**Label**|**Required**: A label to display for the quick view form.|  
|**Display label on the Form**|Displays the label on the form.|  
|**Lookup Column**|Choose one of the lookup columns included in the form.|  
|**Related table**|This value depends on the **Lookup Column** you choose. It is usually the primary table for the 1:N table relationship for the lookup.<br /><br /> If the table includes a **Potential Customer** lookup that can accept either an account or contact, in the **Quick View Form** column you can choose a quick view form for both account and contact by changing this value and then choosing another quick view form.|  
|**Quick View Form**|If the **Related table** has any quick view forms you can select them here. Otherwise, select **New** to create one.<br /><br /> Select **Edit** to change the selected quick view form.|  
|**Additional Properties**|You can specify the default rendering style by selecting the check box.|

>[!NOTE] 
> When you add a multi-line text column to a quick view form, the form will have a height of one regardless of how the column control height is set. This ensures proper rendering of the form while maintaining density. Notice that multi-line text columns on other form types, such as main forms, work differently as the form automatically expands based on the amount of text.
