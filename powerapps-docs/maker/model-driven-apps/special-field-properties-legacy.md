# Overview of model-driven app special field properties

 All fields have the properties listed in [Common field properties](common-field-properties-legacy.md), but certain fields have additional properties, such as this entitlement field that can be opened from the main form for the case entity.

## Lookup field properties  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The options described in the table below are available only for single-entity lookup fields.  
  
|Section|Property|Description|  
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Related Records Filtering**|**Only show records where**|When this is enabled, the records that display when users search for a record will have additional filtering applied. This helps provide more relevant searches when setting the value of the lookup.<br /><br /> By default, this is turned off.<br /><br /> The relationship combinations that are possible when you filter related records are listed in the table following this one.*<br /><br /> The first list is populated with all the potential relationships you can use to filter this lookup. Select one.<br /><br /> The second list is then populated with all relationships that connect the related entity (selected in first list) to the target entity. Select one.<br /><br /> Select the **Allow users to turn off filter** check box to give users the option to turn off the filter you define here.<br /><br /> When users select the **Look Up More Records** option while setting the value for a lookup, they see this dialog box.<br /><br /> ![look-up-more-records](media/crm-ua-v-8-1-look-up-more-records.png) <br /><br /> If you’ve selected the **Allow users to turn off filter** option while configuring the lookup field, users will see the check box to turn off the filter.  This makes it possible for them to see a wider range of records. If you want to make sure that users only see a limited range of records defined by this filter, clear the  **Allow users to turn off filter** check box.|  
|**Additional Properties**|**Display Search Box in lookup dialog**|You can choose not to display the search box in the lookup dialog.|  
||**Default View**|This view is used to filter the results of the inline search and set the default view shown in the lookup dialog when users select the **Look Up More Records** option.<br /><br /> The default view also controls which fields are included in the inline lookup.<br /><br /> For lookups that only allow selection of a single entity type, the fields displayed in the inline lookup are set to be the first two fields included in the default view. In this example, **Main Phone** and **Email** are the first two columns in the default view configured for an account lookup.<br /><br /> For system lookups that allow for multiple entity types, the first two columns of the entity lookup view are shown.|  
||**View Selector**|You can choose from three options:<br /><br /> -   **Off**: Don’t allow users to choose a different view.<br />-   **Show All Views**: All views are available.<br />-   **Show Selected Views**: When you choose this option you can use the Ctrl key and your cursor to choose which views to show. The Lookup view for the entity can’t be de-selected.|

- **Checkbox**: A single checkbox to set the true value, otherwise false.  
  
- **List**: A drop-down list containing both values.
