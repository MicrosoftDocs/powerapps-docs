# Manage model-driven app properties in the app designer

App properties define important details about the app, like its title. You define app properties when you create an app. If you want to change those properties later, you can do that in the app designer.  
  
1. In the app designer, on the left pane, select **App** under the **Pages** section. Or alternatively, select **Settings** on the command bar.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![App designer Properties pane](media/model-driven-app-properties.png "App designer Properties pane")  
  
2. Change the information, as required:

    |Property|Description|  
    |--------------|-----------------|
    |**App name**|Enter a unique and meaningful name for the app.|  
    |**Description**|Type a short description of what the app is.|  
    | **Icon** | Customize app icon using web resources. |
    | App tile preview| Preview the app tile image with the app icon. |

3. Save the app.  

## Known limitations
