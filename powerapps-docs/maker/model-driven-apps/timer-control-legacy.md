# Model-driven app timer control overview

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Use a timer control with forms where rows need to meet a specific time-based milestone. A timer control shows people how much time is available to complete an action in the resolution of an active row or how much time has passed since the time to complete the action has passed. At a minimum, timer controls must be configured to show success or failure in completing the action. In addition, they can be configured to display warnings when the conditions are approaching failure.  
  
A timer control can be added to a form for any table, but they are most frequently used for the case table, especially when linked to columns that track service level agreements. You can add multiple timer controls in the body of a form. You canâ€™t add them to the header or footer.

To add a timer control to a form:

1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

2.  On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Tables**.

3.  Select a table, such as the account table, and then select the **Forms** tab.

4.  Select the form that you want.

5.  In the form designer, on the command menu, select **Switch to classic**.
  
6.  In the classic form designer, select the **Insert** tab, and then on the toolbar select **Timer**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Insert timer control](media/insert-timer-control.png)

7.  On the Timer Control properties page, enter or select the properties that you want, and then select **OK**. 

Timer control **Data Source** properties use columns for the table.  
  
-   The **Failure Time Column** uses a date-time column to set the time.  
  
-   The three condition columns use one of the **Choice**, **Two Options**, **Status**, or **Status Reason** columns for the table.
