# App navigation in model-driven apps

In a model-driven app, there are the three main app runtime navigation components.

1. *Areas* - For apps with more than one area, a switch control is displayed in the lower left navigation pane. In the screenshot below, the current area is named *Accounts*.
1. *Groups* - Group names appear as a navigation element in an app with the subarea names within the group listed beneath it. In the screenshot below, one group is named *Accounts* and one is named *New Group*.
1. *Pages* - Pages appear under the group that they're configured within in the app designer. In the screenshot below, one page is named *All accounts revenue* and another page is named *Contacts*.
