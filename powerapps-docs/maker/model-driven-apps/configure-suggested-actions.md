# Configure suggested actions in model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Suggested actions help users focus on what matters most by surfacing intelligent, context-aware recommendations for high-value records. Makers define these actions, and the system dynamically suggests them to users when they navigate to records based on record data and inferred business logic.

This article shows you how to configure suggested actions.

> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2216214), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

> - This feature is available only in the English language.

## Prerequisites

- The [Copilot in Power Apps](../canvas-apps/ai-overview.md) environment setting must be enabled. 

## Why suggested actions matter

In model-driven apps, users often spend significant time identifying which records are most urgent, deciding what to do next, and executing those tasks. Suggested actions reduce this effort by guiding users toward meaningful next steps that help them act faster and more intelligently.

> [!NOTE]
> Suggested actions are generated by combining maker-defined criteria with app data and historical usage. When a user navigates to a record, the system evaluates whether any configured actions apply by inferring business logic from maker input and past behavior. It then generates potential actions, filters them based on confidence, and surfaces only the most relevant ones. When a user completes or dismisses suggested actions, it feeds back into the system to improve future recommendations.

## Configure suggested actions
  
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com), select **Apps**, and then select **Edit** for the app you want to modify.
1. In the app designer, select **Agents** on the left navigation pane.

1. Select **+ Create**, and then select **Suggested action**.
1. Select a table used in your application where suggested actions should be generated. The table where you want to generate suggested actions must first be added to your application.

1. Fill in the fields:
