# Create, edit, or configure forms using the form designer 
Use the new form designer to create, edit, or configure forms for model-driven apps. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new model-driven form designer does not currently support editing card forms. More information: [Form types](types-forms.md)

## Create a form 
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2. On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Tables**. 
3. Select a table, such as the account table, and then select the **Forms** tab. 
4. Select **Add form**, and then select one of the following
    - **Main form**  
    The contents of the new form are filled using the existing main form definition. If multiple main forms exist, the form at the top of the list in the form order is used to fill the new form. 
    - **Quick create form**
    - **Quick view form**
5. When you are done making changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to app users.  

## Edit a form 
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2. On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Tables**. 
3. Select a table, such as the account table, and then select the **Forms** tab.
4. Select the form name that you want to edit.  
    - You can also select the row for a form, and then in the command bar, select **Edit form**
    - Another alternative is to select **...** next to the form name, and then in the menu, select **Edit form**. 
5. When you are done making changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to app users. 

## Configure a form
These are the properties available to configure a form when you create or edit a form using the form designer.

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Title**  | Enter a name that is meaningful to other makers and app users. This name is shown to app users. If users have access to multiple forms for a table they will use this name to differentiate between the available forms. <br /><br />This property is required. |
|**Description** |  Enter a description that explains how the form is different from other main forms. This description is only shown to makers in the list of forms for a table in the solution explorer. |
|**Max Width** | Set a maximum width (in pixels) to limit the width of the form. The default value is 1900. <br /><br />This property is required. |
|**Show image** | Show the tableâ€™s **Primary Image** if it has one set. This setting will enable showing the image column in the header of the form. <br /><br /> See Enable or disable table options for more information about table options. |
