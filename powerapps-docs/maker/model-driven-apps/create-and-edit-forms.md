# Create, edit, or configure forms using the form designer

Use the new form designer to create, edit, or configure forms for model-driven apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new model-driven form designer does not currently support editing card forms. More information: [Form types](types-forms.md)

## Create a form 
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2. On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Tables**.
   > [!Note]
   > Customizations to a table take should place within a [solution](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#solution). To update a table within a solution, open your **solution**, and then open the **table**.

3. Select a table, such as the account table, and then select the **Forms** tab.

4. Select **Add form**, and then select one of the following
    - **Main form**  
    The primary form type for interaction by users with record data.  The contents of the new form are filled using the existing main form definition. If multiple main forms exist, the form at the top of the list in the form order for your app is used to fill the new form.
      [Learn more about main forms](create-edit-main-forms.md)
    - **Quick create form** [Learn more about quick create forms](create-edit-quick-create-forms.md)
    - **Quick view form** [Learn more about quick view forms](create-edit-quick-view-forms.md)
5. On completion of changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** to save and make changes visible to app users.  

An extract of this process is shown below.

## Edit a form

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

3. Open a table, such as the account table, and then select the **Forms** tab.
4. Select the form name where edits are required.  
    - The row in the grid that relates to a form can be selected, and then in the command bar, select **Edit form**
    - Alternatively, select **...** next to the form name, and then in the menu, select **Edit form**.
5. On completion of changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** to save and make changes visible to app users.

## Configure a form

These are the properties available to configure a form when you create or edit a form using the form designer.

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Title**  | Enter a name that is meaningful to other makers and app users. This name is shown to app users. If users have access to multiple forms for a table, they will use this name to differentiate between the available forms. <br /><br />This property is required. |
|**Description** |  Enter a description that explains how the form is different from other main forms. This description is only shown to makers in the list of forms for a table in the solution explorer. |
|**Max Width** | Set a maximum width (in pixels) to limit the width of the form. The default value is 1900. <br /><br />This property is required. |
|**Show image** | Show the tableâ€™s **Primary Image** if it has one set. This setting will enable showing the image column in the header of the form. <br /><br /> More information: [Enable or disable table options](../data-platform/edit-entities.md#enable-or-disable-table-options) |
