# Assign model-driven app form order

 When you have multiple main, quick create, quick view, or card forms for a table, you can assign a form order. The form order determines which of the available forms will be shown by default. The available main forms can be further controlled by assigning security roles to the form. See [Control access to forms](control-access-forms.md) for more information.  
  
 You can't assign security roles to quick create, quick view, or card forms, so the only form that will be used by everyone is the one at the top of the form order.  
  
## To assign a form order  
> [!NOTE]
> To set form order using the new experience, see [Set the form order](control-access-forms.md#set-the-form-order).
  
1.  Open the [solutions explorer](advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer), expand the table that you want, and then select **Forms**.  
  
2.  In the form list toolbar select **Form Order**.  

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Form order toolbar command](media/form-order.png)
  
3.  Choose either **Main Form Set**, **Quick Create Form Set**, **Quick View Form Set**, or **Card Form Set** depending on the type of forms you want to work with. More information: [Type of forms](types-forms.md). 
  
4.  The **Form Order** dialog is a simple list where you can move a selected form up or down in the form order.  
  
5.  After you have set the order you want, click **OK** to close the dialog.
