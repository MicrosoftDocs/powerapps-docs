# Add, configure, move, or delete components on a form

By using the form designer, makers can easily add and configure popular components such as [subgrid](form-designer-add-configure-subgrid.md), [quick view](form-designer-add-configure-quickview.md), [web resources](web-resource-properties-legacy.md), [pen input](additional-controls-for-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md#pen-input), and more.

## Add components to a form

To add components to a form, use the **Components** pane. Components can be found easily using the search in the  **Components** pane.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Components pane.](media/formdesignercomponentspane.png "Components pane")

### Add components to a form using drag and drop

> [!NOTE]
> When adding or moving components using drag and drop, be aware that the form preview is responsive andÂ might render multiple section columns as stacked. To ensure that the component that's added or moved is in the correct section column, drop or paste it anchored to another column or component that is already in that section column.

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
1. On the command bar, select **Add component**, or in the left pane, select **Components** to see a list of available components. Hover over a component in the list to see a preview image, description, and other details of that component.
1. In the **Components** pane, search or scroll to find the required component then select to add the component.
1. Drag and drop the component onto the form preview. As the component is dragged on the form preview, drop targets appear.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Components can be dropped before or after any existing component or column.
    > - Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the component will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute columns and components across the section columns.
    > - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a component changes the currently selected tab, allowing the component to be added to a different tab.
    > - When the component is dropped, in most cases, a dialog to configure the properties of the component will appear. Ensure that all the required properties of the component are configured.
  
1. In the dialog to configure the properties of the component, under **Show component on**, the **Web**, **Mobile**, and **Tablet** options are selected by default to ensure the component is used when the form is displayed on the web, mobile app, and tablet app. Based on you app's requirements, you might want to clear some of the client types for the component.
1. Select **Done**.
1. Repeat steps 3-6 above to add more components.
1. On the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** to make the changes visible to users.

   In most cases, a dialog is displayed to configure the properties of the component. Ensure that all the required properties of the component have been configured.
1. In the dialog to configure the properties of the component, under **Show component on**, the **Web**, **Mobile**, and **Tablet** options are selected by default to ensure the component is used when the form is displayed on the web, mobile app, and tablet app. Based on the requirements some of these options to limit the usage of the component can be cleared.
