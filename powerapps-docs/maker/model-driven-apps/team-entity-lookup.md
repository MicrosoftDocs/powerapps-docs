# Add an entity as a lookup option in your app

With Unified Interface apps, for an entity to be available in a lookup it must be added to the app. For example, contact records have the ability to be assigned to a user or a team.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Entity lookup with both users and teams available](media/entity-lookup-teams.png "Entity lookup with both users and teams available")

However, if the user entity is included in the app but the team entity is not, only user records will appear in a lookup. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Entity lookup with users only](media/entity-lookup-user-only.png "Entity lookup with users only")

## Add the team entity to an app

1. Open the app in the App Designer. 
2. Select the **Components** tab, select **Entities**, and then select **Team**.    

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Add the team entity to the app](media/add-team-entity-app.png "Add the team entity to the app")

3. Select **Save**, and the select **Publish** to make your change available to app users.
