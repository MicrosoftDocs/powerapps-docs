# Add a custom page to your model-driven app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article guides you through creating and editing a custom page for a model-driven app using the modern app designer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Custom pages are a new feature with significant product changes and currently have a number of known limitations outlined in [Custom Page Known Issues](model-app-page-issues.md).

This article walks you through opening a model-driven apps in the app designer, which you use to add a custom page to a model-driven app. If you need to create a new model-driven app, go to [Create a model-driven app with the app designer](create-model-driven-app.md).

## Create or edit a custom page

Custom pages can be created from two places. The first is while authoring a model-driven app in the modern app designer. The other is from the **Solutions** area in Power Apps. Custom pages can be edited from the **Solutions** area but won't appear in the **Home** or **Apps** areas of make.powerapps.com.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom pages must be created from a solution either from the modern app designer and or the **Solutions** area in Power Apps using **New** > **App** > **Page**. The custom page is a different canvas app type than the normal standalone canvas app.

## Publishing a custom page

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, model-driven apps must be re-published after a custom page is published.  Otherwise the model-driven app continues to use the previous published custom page.

After saving changes to a custom page in the canvas designer, the custom page must be first published by the canvas designer. Then all model-driven apps referencing that custom page need to be published. 

1. From canvas designer, select **Publish**

1. From app designer or solution explorer, select **Publish** on each model-driven app referencing the custom page
