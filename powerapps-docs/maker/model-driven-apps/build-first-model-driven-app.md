# Build your first model-driven app

In this tutorial, you create a model-driven app by using one of the standard tables that is available in Microsoft Dataverse, the account table.

## Sign in to Power Apps

Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/). If you don't already have a Power Apps account, select the **Get started free** link.

## Select the environment

An environment in Power Apps is a space to store, manage, and share your organization’s business data, apps, chatbots, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences.

Each environment can have one Dataverse database.

Select the environment you want, or go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) to create a new one. You can choose the environment by selecting **Environment** from the upper right.

## Create your model-driven app

We recommend creating your model-driven app from a solution. A solution is a package that can contain Dataverse tables, forms, views, apps, flows, and other components. By building your model driven-app in a solution, you can easily move it to other environments or preserve a copy in your source control repository.

1. Select **Solutions** on the left navigation pane, and then select **New solution**. More information: [Create a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-solution).

1. Enter a **Display name** for your solution, such as **Power Apps Training**. Next, you add the account table that will be included in your model-driven app.

1. In your solution, select **Add existing**, and then select **Table.**

1. Under **Add existing tables** screen, select the **Account** table, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Include all components**, and then select **Add.**

   Now that you have a solution and have added the account table to it, you're ready to create a model-driven app.

1. In your solution, select **New**, select **App**, and then select **Model-driven app.**

1. Select **Modern app designer**, and then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/select-modern-app-designer.png" alt-text="Use the modern app designer to create a model-driven app.":::

1. Enter a name for the app, such as *My new custom app2*, and then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/create-your-model-driven-app-2.png" alt-text="Enter a name and then select Create.":::

## Add pages to your app

Next, you add a new page to the model-driven app. 
1. Select **New page** from the **Pages** menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/add-pages-to-an-app-1.png" alt-text="Add a page to a model-driven app.":::

1. Select **Table based view and form**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/add-pages-to-an-app-2.png" alt-text="Select a table-based view and form.":::

1. Select the **Account** table, and then select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/add-pages-to-an-app-3.png" alt-text="Select the account table to add it to the app.":::

   The account form and view appear in the pages menu.

1. Select **Account view**, and then select **Manage views**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/add-pages-to-an-app-4.png" alt-text="Manage an account view.":::

1. Select the following views: **Active Accounts**, **All Accounts**, **My Active Accounts, Account Advanced** **Find**, and **Account Lookup**, and then select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/add-pages-to-an-app-5.png" alt-text="Select the views to add in the app.":::

1. On the app designer command bar, select **Save**.

## Publish your app

1. On the app designer command bar, select **Publish**.

After publishing the app, it's ready for you to run or share with others.

## Run your app on a desktop computer

1. To run your app, sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), and  on the left navigation pane, select **Apps**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-model-driven-app/run-your-app-on-desktop-1.png" alt-text="Select Apps.":::

1. Select the app from the app list. The app opens in your browser.  The chart will be visible based on toggling the show hide chart option.

   ![Run the app on a desktop](media/create-a-model-driven-app/run-your-app-on-desktop-2.png "Running the app on a desktop")

## Run your app on mobile

To run your app on your mobile device, follow these steps:

1. Download the app from your device's mobile app store:

   - IOS: [‎Power Apps on the App Store (apple.com)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/power-apps/id1047318566)

   - Android: [Power Apps - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps&hl=en_US&gl=US)

1. Open the app, tap **Sign in**, and then enter your Microsoft work or school account.

1. Select your app from the list to run it.
