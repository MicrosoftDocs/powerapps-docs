# Build your first model-driven app from scratch
Model-driven app design is a component-focused approach to app development. In this topic, you simplify how to create a model-driven app by using one of the standard entities that's available in your Power Apps environment.

> For detailed information about model-driven apps and how to build it, start here: [Understand model-driven app components](model-driven-app-components.md). 

## Sign in to Power Apps
Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/). If you don't already have a [!INCLUDE [powerapps](../../includes/powerapps.md)] account, select the **Get started free** link. 

## Create your model-driven app

1.    Select the environment you want, or go to the [Power Apps admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/) to create a new one.

2.  On the **Home** page, select **Model-driven app from blank**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > <img src="media/build-first-model-driven-app/start-from-blank-model-driven.png" alt="Start from blank model" height="429" width="673">

3.  Select **Create**.

3.    On the **Create a New App** page, enter the following details, and then select **Done**: 
  - **Name**: Enter a name for the app, such as *My first app*. 
  - **Unique Name**: By default, the unique name uses the name your specify in the **Name** box without spaces and preceded by the publisher prefix and an underscore (_). For example, *crecf_Myfirstapp*. More information: [Change the solution publisher prefix](../common-data-service/change-solution-publisher-prefix.md)
  - **Description**: Type a short description of what the app is or does, such as *This is my first app*.
For information about the additional app properties, see [Create an app](create-edit-app.md#create-an-app).

## Add components to your app
From the app designer you add components to your app.
1.    Select the **Open the Site Map Designer** edit button to open the sitemap designer.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Create-new-sitemap](media/build-first-model-driven-app/new-sitemap.png "Site Map Designer")

2.    On the sitemap designer select **New Subarea**, in the right pane select the **Properties** tab, and then select the following properties.
  - **Type**: Entity
  - **Entity**: Account

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Add components to sitemap](media/build-first-model-driven-app/sitemap.png "New Subarea")

3.    Select **Save And Close**.
4.    On the app designer canvas select **Forms**, and then on the right pane under the **Main Forms** group select the **Account** form.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Account main form](media/build-first-model-driven-app/main-form.png "App Forms")

5.    On the app designer canvas select **Views**, and then select the **Active Accounts**, **All Accounts**, and **My Active Accounts** views.<!-- All checkbox seems to be selected by default -->

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Account views](media/build-first-model-driven-app/views.png "App Views")

6. On the app designer canvas select **Charts**, and then select the **Accounts by Industry** chart.
7. On the app designer toolbar, select **Save**.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![App designer toolbar save](media/build-first-model-driven-app/app-designer-toolbar.png "Save the app")
 
<!-- ##  Validate your app
This step checks for component dependencies that are required for the app to work, but haven't yet been added to the app. 

1. On the app designer canvas, select the component that indicates a dependency, such as the **Forms** component. Then, on the right-pane select the **Required** tab, expand **Entity Dependencies** and then select all required dependencies. 

    ![Add dependencies](media/build-first-model-driven-app/resolve-dependencies.png)

2. Select **Add Dependencies**.
3. On the app designer toolbar, select **Save**.  -->

## Publish your app
On the app designer toolbar, select **Publish**.

After publishing the app it's ready for you to run or share with others.
