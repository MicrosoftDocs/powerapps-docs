# Add copilot for app users in model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Copilot for model-driven apps in Power Apps is a next-generation AI assistant for app users to get insights about the data in their apps through conversation in natural language. Copilot helps app users boost their productivity through AI-powered insights and intuitive app navigation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - To use this capability, your environment must be in the US region and have its language set to en-US.
> - You must allow data movement across regions for Generative AI features as a prerequisite for running copilot in Power Apps. This step is especially important if your organization and your environment are in different regions. More information: [Enable copilots and generative AI features](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#enable-data-movement-across-regions).
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - For more information, go to our [preview terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520).
> - This capability is powered by [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).
> - This capability  may be subject to usage limits or capacity throttling.

When enabled, copilot can be accessed through the copilot icon in the right navigation bar in a model-driven app. The copilot pane can be opened or minimized as desired.

Copilot in model-driven apps can answer questions about the Microsoft Dataverse table data in the environment. Copilot can also help you navigate the model-driven app. For example, when a user enters *take me to Online Cases* or *show me Cruise Support Tickets*, the copilot in the model-driven app automatically opens the relevant app screens.

## Enable copilot for model-driven apps feature for your environment

Power Platform administrators enable the copilot feature in model-driven apps for all the users in their environments from the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The copilot for app users in model-driven apps feature isn't enabled by default. Administrators must manually enable this feature for their environments in [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
> - Questions and answers for enterprise data environments that have [customer managed key](/power-platform/admin/customer-managed-key) or [Customer Lockbox](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox) won't use your data stored in Dataverse. You might get answers from copilot, but they won't be based on your Dataverse database.

1. Sign in to the Power Platform admin center at https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com.

2. In the navigation pane, go to **Environments** and select the environment where you want to enable copilot for app users in model-driven apps in. Select **Settings** for this environment on the command bar.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select environment Settings.](media/Environment_settings.png)
 
3. In **Settings** for the selected environment, select **Product** > **Features**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select copilot feature for the environment.](media/Environment_features.png)

4. In the **Features** section, set the value for **Allow users to analyze data using an AI-powered chat experience in canvas and model-driven apps** to **On**, and then **Save** your changes.

## Set your environment to receive monthly updates for model-driven apps

Makers must set their environment to receive monthly model-driven apps updates as a prerequisite for having copilot for end users in model-driven apps.

1. Sign in to the Power Platform admin center at https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com.
2. In the navigation pane, go to **Environments** and select the environment where you want to enable copilot for app users in model-driven apps. Select **Settings** on the command bar.
3. Select **Product** > **Behavior**.  Set **Release channel** for model-driven apps to **Monthly channel**, and then **Save** your changes.
   
  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

More information: [Behavior settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-behavior#settings) and [Changing release channels for model-driven apps](channel-change.md).

## Disable copilot for a model driven app

Makers can disable copilot for their model-driven app. In app designer, open your model-driven app for **Edit**, and then select **Settings** on the command bar. Select **Upcoming** on the **Settings** screen, and then set **Copilot Control** to **Off**. **Save** and **Publish** the model-driven app for the changes to take effect.
