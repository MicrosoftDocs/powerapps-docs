# Add Copilot to model-driven apps (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Copilot for model-driven apps in Power Apps is a next-generation AI assistant for app users to get insights about the data in their apps through conversation in natural language. Copilot helps app users boost their productivity through AI-powered insights and intuitive app navigation.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> - This is a preview feature.
> - To use this capability your environment must be in the US region.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - For more information, go to our [preview terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520).

> - This capability  may be subject to usage limits or capacity throttling.

When enabled, Copilot can be accessed through the Copilot icon in the right navigation bar when you play a model-driven app. The Copilot pane can be opened or minimized as desired. Copilot in model-driven apps answers questions about the configured Microsoft Dataverse table data in the app. Copilot can also help you navigate the app. For example, when a user enters *take me to Online Cases* or *show me Cruise Support Tickets*.

## Prerequisites

- Power Platform administrators enable the AI-powered chat experience for canvas and model-driven apps. From the Power Platform admin center, go  to **Environments** > open the environment you want > **Settings** > **Features**, under **Copilot** set **Allow users to analyze data using an AI-powered chat experience in canvas and model-driven apps**.
- Additionally, to enable Copilot for model-driven apps, the environment must have the release channel set to **Monthly channel**. More information: [Behavior settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-behavior#settings) and [Changing release channels for model-driven apps](channel-change.md).
- Choose the data you want available for answers. Copilot in a model-driven app can answer questions about all the Dataverse tables in the model-driven app, provided they have been configured for Copilot. More information: [Configure tables to use Copilot (preview)](../data-platform/table-settings-for-copilot.md)
  > [!NOTE]
  > Questions and answers for enterprise data environments that have [customer managed key](/power-platform/admin/customer-managed-key) or [Customer Lockbox](/power-platform/admin/about-lockbox) won't use your data stored in Dataverse. You might get answers from Copilot, but they won't be based on your Dataverse database.
