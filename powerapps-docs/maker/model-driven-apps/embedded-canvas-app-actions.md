# Perform predefined actions on the host model-driven form from within an embedded canvas app

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Embedded canvas apps provide the ability to perform predefined actions on the host model-driven form. These actions enable makers to navigate, refresh and save the host model-driven form. Using these actions, an embedded canvas app can act as a more integral part of the model-driven form and the model-driven app.  

The **ModelDrivenFormIntegration** object now includes the following new methods to enable makers to perform actions on the host model-driven form.  
  
### NavigateToMainForm(entityName, mainFormName, recordId)
Navigates the host model-driven form to a main form and displays the specified row.  
* **entityName** - A required string parameter that specifies the parent table of the main form.  
* **formName** - A required string parameter that specifies the name of the main form to navigate to.  
* **recordId** - A required string parameter, that specifies the ID of the row to display in the main form.  
 
Calling the NavigateToMainForm method can show the following error messages.
  
| Error message | Troubleshooting guidance |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Table not found: *[EntityName]*** | Please check the value of the *entityName* parameter and ensure it is a valid table name and that the user has access to it. |
|**Form not found: *[FormName]*** | Please check the value of the *mainFormName* parameter and ensure it is a valid main form name and that the user has access to it. |
|**There was a problem loading the row.** | Please check the value of the *recordId* parameter and ensure it is a valid row ID and that the user has access to it. |
  
  
### NavigateToView(entityName, viewName)
Navigates the host model-driven form to a view.  
* **entityName** - A required string parameter that specifies the parent table of the view.  
* **viewName** - A required string parameter that specifies the name of the main form to navigate to.  
 
Calling the NavigateToView method can show the following error messages.
  
| Error message | Troubleshooting guidance |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Table not found: *[EntityName]*** | Please check the value of the *entityName* parameter and ensure it is a valid table name and that the user has access to it. |
|**View not found: *[ViewName]*** | Please check the value of the *viewName* parameter and ensure it is a valid view name and that the user has access to it. |
  
  
### OpenQuickCreateForm(entityName)  
Opens the default quick create form for an table.  
* **entityName** - A required string parameter that specifies the parent table of the quick create form.  
 
Calling the OpenQuickCreateForm method can show the following error messages.
  
| Error message | Troubleshooting guidance |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Table not found: *[EntityName]*** | Please check the value of the *entityName* parameter and ensure it is a valid table name and that the user has access to it. |
  
  
### RefreshForm(showPrompt)  
Refreshes the data on the host model-driven form.  
* **showPrompt** - A required boolean parameter that indicates if a confirmation prompt should be displayed to the user before saving any unsaved data on the host model-driven form. Values should be "true" or "false".
 
Calling the RefreshForm method can show the following error messages.
  
| Error message | Troubleshooting guidance |
|:--------------|:-------------------------|
|**Please use "true" or "false" as the parameter value.** | Please check the value of the *showPrompt* parameter and ensure that it is either "true" or "false". |
  
  
### SaveForm()  
Saves the data on the host model-driven form.  


> [!NOTE]
> If you do not see the IntelliSense for the methods to perform predefined actions in embedded canvas apps that were created prior to the functionality being made available; save, close and re-open the app.
