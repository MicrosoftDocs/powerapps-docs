# Model-driven app managed properties for views

<a name="BKMK_ManagedProperties"></a>   
 
If a custom public view has been created for a table in Power Apps and is included in a managed solution, there is the option to limit the ability of anyone who is installing the solution from customizing the view.

Additionally, there are high-level options that can be applied to the table that apply to all views.
  
By default, most views have their **Customizable** managed property set to true so that people can customize them. Unless there is a good reason to change this, we recommend you allow people to customize views in the table.  
  
## Set managed properties for all views  

1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

2.  Select **Solutions**, and then open the solution you want. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

3. Select the table you want. Select **...**, and then select **Managed properties** on the command bar.

4. There are a range of options relevant to the current table to either prevent any customizations or to prevent the creation of new views.

5. Make any necessary changes and when finished, select **Done**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The setting does not take effect until the solution is exported from the development environment and imported as a managed solution into a new environment.

## Set managed properties for a view (classic)

With this approach, the ability for the view to be changed can be set at the level of the individual view.
  
1. Open [solution explorer](advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer), expand **Entities**, select the table required, and then select **Views**.  
  
2. Select a custom public view.  
  
3. On the command bar, select **More Actions** > **Managed Properties**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![managed properties menu.](media/managed-properties.png)
  
4. Set the **Customizable** or **Can Be Deleted** options to **True** or **False**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Set managed properties.](media/set-managed-properties.png)
