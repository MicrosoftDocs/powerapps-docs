# Set up and use the news control

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Gain valuable insights from the latest news about your customers, competitors,
and contacts. Staying on top of the news helps you stay ahead of your
competition by showing you real-time contextual information about your customers
and competitors. Install the news Power Apps component framework control, which
delivers relevant news from Bing News.

You can customize to support additional news sources, the look and feel
and the behavior of the PCF control. For more information, see the [readme in the news control GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/companynewspcfcontrol/blob/master/companynews/README.md). 

## Add the company news control to the account main form

The steps in this article add the company news control to the account main form
already configured to query news topics collected from Bing News. You can use
similar steps to add the control to the main form for other tables, such as
contact and competitor.

### Get the Bing News API key and URL

The news control requires a news API URL, API key, and more news URL. For Bing
News, the more news URL is preconfigured in the control to use
*https://www.bing.com/news/search*. For the News API URL, and API Key, youâ€™ll
need to provide these by creating a Cognitive Service component under your Azure
account. Once created, you will get the API key and API URL under the **Keys and Endpoint** section.

### Import the company news solution

2. Download Solutions.zip. To do this, open the **Solutions** folder, open
    **Solutions.zip**, and then select **Download**.

3. Sign-in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then in the upper right select the environment where you want to install the company news control.

4. Select **Solutions** on the left pane, and then select **Import** on the    command bar.

5. In the Import solution wizard, select **Choose File**, browse to and select *Solutions.zip*, and then select **Open**.

6. Select **Next,** and then select **Next** again to complete the import.

### Add the control to the account main form

2. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.

3. In the left navigation tree, expand **Tables** > **Account**, select **Forms**, and then open the **Account Main** form.

    settings as the default and then select **Save and Close**.

10. To provide API Key and Base URL default values, use business rules. Select     **Business Rules** from the form editor, and then select **New Business Rule** from the bottom of the right pane.

11. In the business rule designer, select **Condition** on the designer canvas,     set **Column** to **Account Name** and **Operator** to **Contains data,** and     then select **Apply**. Then, select the **Components** tab, drag a **Set Column Value** action, and provide a column value where **Column** is **newsapikey** and the value is the **Key** you copied from the Azure Cognitive Services properties. Create another **Set Column Value** action where **Column** is **newsurl** and add the value as the **Endpoint** you copied from the Azure Cognitive Services properties. Make sure to append *bing/v7.0/news/search* at the end of the news URL. The final URL should look like https://<yourservicename\>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/bing/v7.0/news/search.
