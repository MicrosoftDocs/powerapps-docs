# Embed a canvas app on a model-driven form

Canvas apps enable makers to easily design and create custom layouts using the low-code, WYSIWYG canvas app designer. Canvas apps also enable makers to connect and display data from over 200 data sources on their forms.

With embedded canvas apps, makers can bring the power of canvas apps to their model-driven forms. Using embedded canvas apps, you can easily create rich visual areas on a form and display data from a variety of sources right next to data from the Microsoft Dataverse.

Canvas apps are embedded in model-driven forms in the same way other custom controls are added. An embedded canvas app includes rich data integration capabilities that bring in contextual data from the host model-driven form to the embedded canvas app. More information: [Add an embedded canvas app on a model-driven form](embedded-canvas-app-add-classic-designer.md).

After you have added an embedded canvas app to your model-driven form, learn how to share your embedded canvas app with other users. More information: [Share an embedded canvas app](share-embedded-canvas-app.md).

For guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps as well as helpful tips to troubleshoot any issues you might encounter, please refer to: [Guidelines on working with embedded canvas apps](embedded-canvas-app-guidelines.md).
