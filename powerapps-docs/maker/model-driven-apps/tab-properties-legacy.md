# Tab properties for model-driven app forms overview

This article describes the classic form editor. We recommend that you u se the modern form designer to add and edit tabs for your model-driven app forms. More information: [Add, configure, move, or delete tabs on a form](add-move-or-delete-tabs-on-form.md)

These are the properties available to configure when using a tab on a form using the classic form designer. The following table shows properties that you can set for tabs on the form:
  
|Tab|Property|Description|  
|---------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Display**|**Name**|**Required**: The unique name for the tab that is used when referencing it in scripts. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.|  
||**Label**|**Required**: The localizable label for the tab visible to users.|  
||**Show the label of this tab on the Form**|When the label is displayed people can select it to toggle whether the tab is expanded or collapsed. Choose whether you want to show the label.|  
||**Expand this tab by default**|The tab state can toggle between expanded or collapsed using form scripts or by people selecting the label. Choose the default state for the tab.|  
||**Visible by default**|Showing the tab is optional and can be controlled using scripts. Choose whether to make the tab visible. More information: [Visibility options](visibility-options-legacy.md)|  
||**Availability**|Choose if you want the tab to be available on the phone.|  
|**Formatting**|**Layout**|Tabs may have up to three columns. Use these options to set the number of tabs and what percentage of the total width they should fill.|  
|**Events**|**Form Libraries**|Specify any JavaScript web resources that will be used in the tab `TabStateChange` event handler.<br /><br />|  
||**Event Handlers**|Configure the functions from the libraries that should be called for the tab `TabStateChange` event. More information: [Configure Event Handlers](configure-event-handlers-legacy.md)|
