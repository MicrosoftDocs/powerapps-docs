# Use Monitor tool to troubleshoot page behavior in model-driven apps

Monitor can help you debug and diagnose problems, which help you build faster, more reliable model-driven apps. Monitor provides a deep view into how an app runs by providing a log of all activities in your app as it runs.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Monitor must be run on the model-driven app and not directly on a custom page.

When you filter on model-driven app custom page-related events in Monitor, you can get information about related tables, tables, controls, and components on a custom page in Monitor as your app runs. More information: [Debug a model-driven app with Monitor](../monitor-modelapps.md)
