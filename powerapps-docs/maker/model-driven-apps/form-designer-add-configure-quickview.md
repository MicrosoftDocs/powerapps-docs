# Add and configure a quick view component on a form  
A main form that displays the details of a row can use a quick view component to display read-only details of a related row (lookup). The data displayed by the quick view component is defined by the quick view form of the related table. When there is no related row, such as a lookup, the quick view component is automatically hidden.

## Add a quick view component
You add a quick view component in the same way as you add any other component. More information: [Add, configure, move, or delete components on a form](add-move-configure-or-delete-components-on-form.md)

## Configure a quick view component
These are the properties available to configure when using a quick view component on a form using the form designer.


<!--note from editor: "Drop-down" should be used only as an adjective. In the following table, is it a list? A menu? (It's used three times in line 44.) --> 


|Area   |Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Display options** | **Label** | The localizable label for the quick view visible to users. <br /><br /> This property is required. |
| **Display options** | **Name** |  The unique name for the quick view that is used when referencing it in scripts. The name can contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores. <br /> <br />This property is required. |
| **Display options**  | **Hide label** |  When selected, the quick view label is hidden. |
| **Display options**  | **Quick view forms** |  A list of quick view forms that are displayed to app users. <br /><br />To configure the list of quick view forms <br /><br /> Select **Select forms ...**, and then in the **Lookup** drop-down select a lookup column where you want to display a quick view form. <br /><br />Depending on the lookup column you select in the **Lookup** drop-down, you will see drop-downs that will let you select quick view forms for one or more tables. |
