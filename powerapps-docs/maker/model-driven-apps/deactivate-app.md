# Hide a model-driven app from users

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Deactivate a model-driven app to hide it from users who otherwise would be able to find and run it. When you deactivate a model-drive app, it no longer appears in the common places where apps are found, such as from the list of model-driven apps displayed in the Power Apps mobile app or [Office apps](https://www.office.com/apps).

## Deactivate a model-driven app

1. Sign in to Power Apps.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Apps**.
1. Select the app that you want to hide from all users, and then select **Deactivate** on the command bar or app context menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Deactivated apps are still visible to other users from the **Apps** area of Power Apps.

You can activate a deactivated app by selecting the app, and then select **Activate**.
