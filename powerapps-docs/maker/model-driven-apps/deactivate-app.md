# Hide a model-driven app from users

Turn off a model-driven app to hide it from users who otherwise would be able to find and run it. When a model-driven app is turned off, it no longer appears in the common places where apps are found, such as the list of model-driven apps displayed in Power Apps Mobile or [Office apps](https://www.office.com/apps).

## Turn off a model-driven app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Select the environment where the app is located.
1. Select **Solutions**, and then open the solution you want.
1. Select the model-driven app to be hidden from all users, and then on the command bar select **...** > **Turn off**.

The **Status** of the app appears as **Off** from the solution's **Objects** view.

> [!NOTE]
> - Apps that are turned off are still visible to other users from the **Apps** area of Power Apps.
> - While a model-driven app is in a turned off state, it can't be played or shared.

## Turn on a model-driven app

An app that is turned off can be turned on by following the same steps described earlier and then selecting **Turn on**.
