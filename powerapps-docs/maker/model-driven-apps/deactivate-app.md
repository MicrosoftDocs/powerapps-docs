# Hide a model-driven app from users

Deactivate a model-driven app to hide it from users who otherwise would be able to find and run it. When you deactivate a model-driven app, it no longer appears in the common places where apps are found, such as the list of model-driven apps displayed in Power Apps Mobile or [Office apps](https://www.office.com/apps).

## Deactivate a model-driven app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. On the left pane, select **Apps**.
1. Select the app that you want to hide from all users, and then select **Deactivate** on the command bar or app context menu.

> [!NOTE]
> - Deactivated apps are still visible to other users from the **Apps** area of Power Apps.
> - While a model-driven app is in a deactivated state, it can't be played or shared.

You can activate a deactivated app by selecting the app and then selecting **Activate**.
