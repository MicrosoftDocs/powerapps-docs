# Add connectors to a custom page for your model-driven app (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This article outlines the use of Power Apps connectors within a custom page. The most common connectors are listed here. This article also includes the known issues for connectors in custom pages.

Publishing a model-driven app with custom pages will consolidate all of the connections within the app. This connector consolidation allows for a single consent prompt for all of the connectors at the start of the app.
