# Add geospatial components to your app


You can add a number of geospatial components to your canvas app to support scenarios that involve mapping locations and addresses.

Components are groups of controls that can answer the need for a specific scenario. You can read more about components and how to build your own in [the Power Apps developer library](../../developer/component-framework/custom-controls-overview.md).

The following prebuilt components can be used for geospatial and mapping scenarios:

- [Interactive map](geospatial-component-map.md)
- [Address input](geospatial-component-input-address.md)

## Prerequisites

1. An admin must [enable the geospatial features in the Power Platform admin center](#enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment) for the environment. This requires reviewing and agreeing to specific terms of service.
2. An admin must [ensure the geospatial components will not be blocked by the environment's data loss prevention policies](#review-the-environments-data-loss-prevention-policies).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >The components require the default **Organizations** data source to be present. This data source is included whenever you insert the components into an app, but if you manually delete it you'll need to add it before the components will work:
    >
    >1. With the component selected, go to the **Data sources** tab on the side navigation menu.
    >2. In the search field, enter **Organizations**, and then select the data source that appears. This will add it to the component.

### Enable the geospatial features for the environment

Before you can use geospatial features in your apps, an admin must enable access to the features for the environment where you want to create your app.

The geospatial features require additional terms of use that must be reviewed and agreed to.

1. Open the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

1. On the **Environments** tab, select the environment you want to use for your apps, and then select **Settings** from the top menu.

1. Expand **Product**, and then select **Features**.

1. Under **Geospatial services (preview)**, set the toggle switch to **On**. A terms of service notice will appear. Read through the terms of service, and if you agree, select the checkbox **I agree to the terms of service**, and then select **Enable**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >You must read and agree to the terms of service before you can use geospatial features. 
    >
    >The following are the terms of service:  
    >  
    >These features use mapping capabilities that are powered by a third party, TomTom(tm), and operate outside your tenant's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance.  
    >
    >Microsoft shares the address and location queries with TomTom(tm). The name of the customer or end user who entered the query is not shared.
    >
    >This feature is non-regional and the queries you provide may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its subprocessors operate.
    >
    >Additional licensing requirements might be required to enable this feature.  

    >[!NOTE]
    >Requests sent between TomTom(tm) and the Azure Maps service are not exposed over the public Internet.
    >
    >Requests between apps you create with the component and the Azure Maps service are sent over HTTPS.
    

1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the settings page.

### Review the environment's data loss prevention policies

The geospatial components require the Microsoft Dataverse and Spatial Services connectors. This connector is used by the Power Apps Maps and Address Input components to connect to Microsoftâ€™s Azure Maps service. It is used to fetch map tiles and satellite imagery, geocode addresses, and search for addresses. Thus, it is required for the Interactive Map and Address Input components to function.

For the components to function properly, these connectors must not have conflicting data loss prevention policies. An admin must review the environment's data loss prevention policies and ensure that these connectors are classified under the same data group, typically the **Business** data group. [Learn more about data loss prevention policies for Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/prevent-data-loss). 


### Next steps

Start installing the components in your apps:

- Visualize and interpret location data with the **[Interactive map](geospatial-component-map.md)** component.
- See dynamic address suggestions as you type with the **[Address input](geospatial-component-input-address.md)** component.
