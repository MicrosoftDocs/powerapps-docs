# Add pins to 3D models in Power Apps

Add pins (shown as circular markers) to 3D models in your canvas apps. Users can add their own pins and view information about pins they select.

## Add predefined pins to a 3D model from an Excel workbook

The easiest way to add pins to a 3D model is to load them from an Excel workbook.

The data source for the pins must be a named table in Excel. The table must have four columns. Each column corresponds to a property of the **3D object** control. Each row is plotted as a pin on the model. The rows determine the placement of the pins in a three-dimensional coordinate system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mixed-reality (MR) controls in Power Apps use a [left-handed coordinate system](/windows/uwp/graphics-concepts/coordinate-systems).

| Column | Corresponds to |
| - | - |
| Label | ItemsLabels |
| X | PinsX |
| Y | PinsY |
| Z | PinsZ |

Here's an example of a table named "TestPins" that contains coordinates to place four pins on a 3D model:

:::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-table-sample.png" alt-text="An example Microsoft Excel worksheet with a table named TestPins that contains Label, X, Y, and Z columns.":::

To try this example, start by creating a table in Excel.

1. Copy the following sample data and paste it in cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet.

    | Label | X Pins | Y Pins | Z Pins |
    | - | - | - | - |
    | Front Left | -0.2 | 0.01 | 0.2 |
    | Front Right | 0.2 | 0.01 | 0.2 |
    | Zero | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | X Point | 0 | 0.72 | -0.2 |

2. Select one of the pasted cells. On the **Home** tab, select **Format as Table**, choose a style, and then select **OK**.
3. On the **Table Design** tab under **Table Name**, enter a name such as *TestPins*.
4. Save the workbook and close it.

Next, add the table as a data source to display pins on a 3D model.

1. In Power Apps Studio, [insert a 3D model](mixed-reality-component-view-3d.md) or select an existing model.
2. [Set the **3D object** control's **Source** property](mixed-reality-component-view-3d-store.md) to *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/chair.glb* (or any other model file of your choosing).

> [!NOTE]
> The first instance of the **3D object** control is named *3DObject1* by default and that's the name we'll use in the following examples. Additional instances of the control would be referred to as *ViewIn3D2*, *ViewIn3D3*, and so on.

1. On the model's **Properties** tab, select the **Pins(Items)** dropdown list.
2. Type *excel* in the search box, and then select **Import from Excel**.
3. Locate the Excel workbook you saved earlier and open it.
4. Select the name you gave the table in Excel and then select **Connect**.
5. On the **Advanced** tab, find **PinsX**, **PinsY**, and **PinsZ** and enter the name of the corresponding column in the table. (In this example, enter *Label* in **ItemsLabels**, *X* in **PinsX**, and so on.) Enclose the column name in quotation marks.

Pins appear on the model at the locations described by the coordinates.

## Show the label and coordinates of pins on a 3D model

Use a data table to display the label and coordinates of selected pins in a canvas app.

:::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-all.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a 3D model under construction in Microsoft Power Apps Studio. Four pins have been placed on the model, and information about the pins is shown in a table below the model.":::

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Layout**.
2. Select **Data table** to place a table in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.
3. Choose to show information about all pins or only the selected pin. With the data table selected:

   - **Show all pins:** In the **Properties** pane, select the **Pins(Items)** dropdown list and select the Excel table you connected to earlier.

   - **Show the selected pin only:** In the Power Apps Studio expression editor, enter *3DObject1.SelectedItems*.

       :::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-label-selected.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Power Apps Studio expression editor showing the expression used to display information about a selected pin.":::

4. On the **Properties** pane, select **Edit fields**, and then select **Add field**.
5. Select the columns to show, and then select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-add-fields.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a 3D model under construction in Power Apps Studio, shown alongside a list of fields to add to a data table.":::

## Show the label of a selected pin on a 3D model

Use a text box to display just the label of the selected pin in a canvas app.

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Select **Text label** to place a text box in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.
3. In the expression editor, enter *3DObject1.Selected.Label*.

## Create a collection to let users add their own pins to a 3D model

If you want to allow users to place pins on a 3D model, [use a collection](create-update-collection.md).

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Select **Text input** to place a text entry box in the app screen.
3. Copy the text box and paste it three times to create four text input controls.
4. Set the **Default** property for each control to *X*, *Y*, *Z*, and *Label*, respectively.
5. Open the **Tree view** tab.
6. Rename each control, as appropriate, to *XCoordinate*, *YCoordinate*, *ZCoordinate*, and *LabelInput*.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-coords.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Power Apps Studio tree view that shows four renamed text input controls.":::

Next, add a button to append the user's data to the pin collection.

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Select **Button** to place a button in the app screen.
3. Set the button's **Text** property to *Add pin*.
4. Enter the following code in the button's **OnSelect** property, exactly as shown:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Collect( 
    PinsCollection,
      {
        X: XCoordinate.Text,
        Y: YCoordinate.Text,
        Z: ZCoordinate.Text,
        Label: LabelInput.Text
      }
    )
    ```

Now you'll change the data source of the pins from the Excel table to the new collection.

1. Select the 3D model.
2. On the **Properties** tab, select the **Pins(Items)** dropdown list, and then select **PinsCollection**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/augmented/pins-collect-connect.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Pins(Items) property of a 3D model in Power Apps Studio, with the data source PinsCollection selected.":::

3. On the **Advanced** tab, find **PinsX**, **PinsY**, and **PinsZ** and set them to *X*, *Y*, and *Z*, respectively.

When the user enters coordinates and a label and selects **Add pin**, a labeled pin is placed on the model at the entered coordinates.

## Show information about pins as they're added to a 3D model

Finally, combine the previous examples by displaying information about the pins as the user adds them.

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Add a data table to the screen.
2. On the **Properties** tab, select the **Pins(Items)** dropdown list and select **PinsCollection**.
3. Select **Edit fields**, and then select **Add field**.
4. Select the columns to show in the table, and then select **Add**.

## Other mixed reality controls

- View 3D content in mixed reality with the **[View in MR](mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md)** control.
- Measure distance, area, and volume with the **[Measuring Camera](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md)** control.
- Create and view predefined 3D shapes with the **[View shape in MR](mixed-reality-component-view-shape.md)** control.
- Paint 3D lines or draw 3D arrows to specify an area or asset in your environment with the **[Markup in MR](markup-in-mixed-reality.md)** control.
