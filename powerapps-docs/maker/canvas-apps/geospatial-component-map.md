# Interactive map control 

Easily bring dynamic mapping capabilities into your canvas apps by viewing the physical position of objects from a data source, or by inputting new physical locations.

Pan, tilt, zoom, and drag to center your map view. As you zoom out, the markers will optionally cluster to represent dense groups of data. 

The current location of the user can also be represented on the map on mobile devices or web experiences. 

The map control also supports road and satellite views.

![Map control.](./media/augmented-geospatial/geospatial-map-component.png "Map control")

To use the control, you need to [enable geospatial features for the environment](geospatial-overview.md#enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment).

Make sure you also [review the prerequisites for using geospatial controls](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites).

## Use the control

Insert the control into your app as you normally would for any other control or control.

With an app open for editing in the [Power Apps studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Media**.
3. Select the control **Map** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag it to position it anywhere on the screen.
4. To show the user's current location, 
	- Toggle **Show current location** to **On**. 
	- Under the property **Current location latitude**, insert **Location.Latitude**. 
	- Under the property **Current location longitude**, insert **Location.Longitude**. 
	- The current location pin should now appear on the map.
	
You can modify the control by using a number of [properties](#input-properties).

### Use the map control with data from Excel

You can load a table that contains existing data from an Excel workbook into the map control. The control will then plot each row in your table as a map pin.

Your workbook needs to contain a named table with the following columns that should then be mapped to the associated property in the control's **Advanced** pane.

Column description | Maps to property | Required
-- | -- | --
Label for the pin | ItemsLabels | Required
Longitude of the pin | ItemsLongitudes | Required
Latitude of the pin | ItemsLatitudes | Required
Color of the pin | ItemsColors | Optional
Icon for the pin | ItemsIcons | Optional



The color field accepts any CSS string, as defined in [Color enumeration and ColorFade, ColorValue, and RGBA functions in Power Apps](/functions/function-colors).

You can use the icons described in the [List of image templates](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-image-templates-web-sdk#list-of-image-templates) topic as your icon.


The following Excel table shows the required columns:

You can copy the following sample data to test this functionality:

Name | Longitude | Latitude | Color | Icon
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Fourth Coffee (sample) | -98.29277 | 26.2774 | Blue | marker-flat
Litware, Inc. (sample) | -96.85572 | 32.55253 | #ffefcd| hexagon-thick
Adventure Works (sample) | -96.99952 | 32.72058 | | car
Fabrikam, Inc. (sample) | -118.30746 | 34.86543 | |
Blue Yonder Airlines (sample) | -118.66184 | 34.17553 | |
City Power & Light (sample) | -113.46184 | 37.15363 | |
Contoso Pharmaceuticals (sample) | -80.26711 | 40.19918 | |
Alpine Ski House (sample) | -102.63908 | 35.20919 | |
A Datum Corporation (sample) | -89.39433 | 40.71025 | |
Coho Winery (sample) | -116.97751 | 32.87466 | |




1. Copy and paste the table into a new Excel workbook.

1. Select one of the cells, and then on the Home tab in the ribbon, select **Format as Table** and choose any style, and then **OK**.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the format as table option in Excel.](./media/geospatial/convert-table.png)

1. Select the table, and then go to the **Table Design** tab on the ribbon. Enter a name for the table under **Table Name:**, for example *TestData*.

    ![Screenshot highlighting the table name in Excel.](./media/geospatial/table-name.png)

1. Save the workbook.

1. Open or create a new app in Power Apps, and insert the map control.

1. On the **Properties** pane, select the **Locations(Items)** field and then search for *excel* and select **Import from Excel**.

4. To show the user's current location: 
	1. Switch **Show current location** to **On**. 
	2. Under the property **Current location latitude**, insert **Location.Latitude**. 
	3. Under the property **Current location longitude**, insert **Location.Longitude**. 
	4. The current location pin should now appear on the map.
