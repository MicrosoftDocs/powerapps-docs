# Interactive map control

Easily add an interactive map to your canvas apps. Plot markers from a data source containing addresses or latitude and longitude pairs. As you zoom out, the markers will optionally cluster to condense groups of data. On mobile devices and web experiences, a map can show the user's current position and calculate a route to the user's destination. Maps can be switched between road and satellite views.

## Interactive map features

- [Use a data source to insert pins](geospatial-map-excel.md)
- [Display information about map pins](geospatial-map-infocards.md)
- [Show routes between waypoints](geospatial-map-routing.md)
- [Draw and insert shapes](geospatial-map-draw-shapes.md)

## Prerequisites

You'll need to satisfy a few [prerequisites](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites-for-full-support) before you can use maps in your canvas apps. Refer to the [privacy and security table](geospatial-overview.md#privacy-and-security-considerations) for more details on how different map features use data.

## Add a map to an app screen

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Select the **Insert** tab and expand **Media**.
2. Select **Map** to place a map in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.

## Adding pins, routes, and shapes

Pins, routes, and shapes are data set properties that need to both identify a data source, which is a table from a collection or connector, and the relevant columns. The data source is set in the Items property (Items for pins, RouteWaypoints_Items for routes, Shape_Items for shapes) and the relevant columns are set in the related properties (e.g. ItemLatitudes, ItemLongitudes, etc for pins). The [Properties](#properties) section contains additional information about these data sets and their related properties.

For example, if you had a table collection named **Locations** with **Name**, **Longitude**, and **Latitude** columns:

| Name | Longitude | Latitude |
| - | - | - |
| Fourth Coffee (sample) | -98.29277 | 26.2774 |
| Litware, Inc. (sample) | -96.85572 | 32.55253 |
| Adventure Works (sample) | -96.99952 | 32.72058 |

To display these as labeled pins on the map:

1. Set the **Items** property to Locations
1. Set the **ItemLabels** property to "Name"
1. Set the **ItemLongitude** property to "Longitude"
1. Set the **ItemLatitude** property to "Latitude"

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >The relevant column names need to be in quotation marks in the related properties. The data source should not have quotation marks.

You can see how to do [display pins from an Excel sheet](geospatial-map-excel.md) or [build an app](how-to/mobile-apps-address-map.md) that uses the address input control to populate pins on the map control as additional examples.

 >[!NOTE]
 > Each map control can display up to 5000 pins from latitude or longitude and 50 pins from addresses. The pin limit is lower for addresses as the map needs to geocode these addresses into latitude or longitude to display them. We recommend not using addresses where possible. You can [save geocoded addresses back to your data source](geospatial-map-excel.md#save-geocoded-addresses-from-map-control-to-data-source).
 >
 > When both latitude or longitude and an address is given for a single pin, the map control will prioritize using the latitude or longitude to avoid geocoding the address.

## Properties

Change a map's behavior and appearance using properties. Some properties are only available on the **Advanced** tab.

:::image type="content" source="./media/augmented-geospatial/geospatial-controls.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a phone app in which a map control is shown next to the Properties tab in Microsoft Power Apps Studio.":::

The map control has six different types of properties:

1. [Styling properties](#styling-properties)
1. [Behavioral properties](#behavioral-properties)
1. [Pin properties](#pin-properties)
1. [Route properties](#route-properties)
1. [Shape properties](#shape-properties)
1. [Output properties](#output-properties)

### Pin properties

| - | - | - | - |
| Locations(Items) | Identifies a [data source](./geospatial-map-excel.md) (**Items**) in the form of a table from which to get locations to show on the map. The table lists sets of longitudes and latitudes, or physical addresses, to display as pins. Using latitude or longitude is recommended as addresses need to be geocoded and so have a more restrictive pin limit. The table can be a collection or from a data source like Excel Online. Each row must have an entry for label, longitude, and latitude, or a physical address, and optionally the pin color and icon. | Not applicable | Properties; Advanced: **Items** |
| ItemsLabels | Identifies the column in **Items** that contains the labels for the pins. | ColumnName | Advanced |
| ItemsLatitudes | Identifies the column in **Items** that contains the latitude position of the pins. | ColumnName | Advanced |
| ItemsLongitudes | Identifies the column in **Items** that contains the longitude position of the pins.  | ColumnName | Advanced |

We recommend geocoding your addresses to latitude, longitude pairs and using those to display pins when possible. | ColumnName | Advanced |
| ItemsColors | Identifies the column in **Items** that contains the colors of the pins. | ColumnName | Advanced |
| ItemsIcons | Identifies the column in **Items** that contains the icons of the pins. | ColumnName | Advanced |
| Cluster pins | Groups nearby map pins instead of displaying them individually. | Boolean | Properties; Advanced: **Clustering** |
