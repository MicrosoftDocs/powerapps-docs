# Interactive map component (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Easily bring dynamic mapping capabilities into your canvas apps by viewing the physical position of entities from a data source, or by inputting new physical locations.

Pan, tilt, zoom, and drag to center your map view. As you zoom out, the markers will optionally cluster to represent dense groups of data. 

The current location of the user can also be represented on the map on mobile devices or web experiences. 

The map component also supports road and satellite views.

![Map component](./media/augmented-geospatial/geospatial-map-component.png "Map component")

To use the component, you need to [enable geospatial features for the environment](geospatial-overview.md#enable-the-geospatial-features-for-the-environment) in addition to [enabling geospatial features for each app](geospatial-overview.md#enable-the-geospatial-features-for-each-app) that you want to use it in.

Make sure you also [review the prerequisites for using geospatial components](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites).

## Use the component

Insert the component into your app as you normally would for any other control or component.

With an app open for editing in the [Power Apps studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Media**.
3. Select the component **Map** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag it to position it anywhere on the screen.
4. (Optional) Select **Allow** in the window that asks to know your location. This enables the component to display the user's current location.

    ![Allow highlighted in the window that asks to know your location](./media/geospatial/address-allow.png "Allow highlighted in the window that asks to know your location")

You can modify the component by using a number of [properties](#properties).

### Use the map component with data from Excel

You can load a table that contains existing data from an Excel workbook into the map component. The component will then plot each row in your table as a map pin.

Your workbook needs to contain a named table with the following columns that should then be mapped to the associated property in the component's **Advanced** pane.

Column description | Maps to property
-- | -- 
Label for the pin | ItemsLabels
Longitude of the pin | ItemsLongitudes
Latitude of the pin | ItemsLattitudes

You can also use a string to denote the address, in which case ItemsLongitudes and ItemsLatitudes won't work.


The following is an example of an Excel table with the required columns:

![Sample excel file with a table named TestData and containing Name, Longitude, and Latitude columns](./media/geospatial/sample-excel.png)

You can copy the following sample data to test this functionality:

Name | Longitude | Latitude
-- | -- | --
Fourth Coffee (sample) | -98.29277 | 26.2774
Litware, Inc. (sample) | -96.85572 | 32.55253
Adventure Works (sample) | -96.99952 | 32.72058
Fabrikam, Inc. (sample) | -118.30746 | 34.86543
Blue Yonder Airlines (sample) | -118.66184 | 34.17553
City Power & Light (sample) | -113.46184 | 37.15363
Contoso Pharmaceuticals (sample) | -80.26711 | 40.19918
Alpine Ski House (sample) | -102.63908 | 35.20919
A. Datum Corporation (sample) | -89.39433 | 40.71025
Coho Winery (sample) | -116.97751 | 32.87466




1. Copy and paste the table into a new Excel workbook.

1. Select one of the cells, and then on the Home tab in the ribbon, select **Format as Table** and choose any style, and then **OK**.

    ![](./media/geospatial/convert-table.png)

1. Select the table, and then go to the **Table Design** tab on the ribbon. Enter a name for the table under **Table Name:**, for example *TestData*.

    ![](./media/geospatial/table-name.png)

1. Save the workbook.

1. Open or create a new app in Power Apps, and insert the map component.

1. On the **Properties** pane, select the **Data source(Items)** field and then search for *excel* and select **Import from Excel**.

    ![](./media/geospatial/select-excel.png)

1. Locate the Excel workbook and then select **Open**. Select the table that contains the information, **TestData**, and then **Connect**.

    ![](./media/geospatial/select-table.png)

1. On the **Properties** pane, go to the **Advanced** tab, and select **More options**.

1. Set the following properties:

    - **ItemsLabels** as *TestData.Name*
    - **ItemLatitudes** as *TestData.Latitude*
    - **ItemsLongitudes** as *TestData.Longitude*

1. The map component will now show each row in the table as a pin, labeled with its *Name* as defined in the Excel table.

### Properties

The following properties can be defined and configured in the component's **Properties** pane.

![Map component displayed next to its Properties pane](./media/augmented-geospatial/geospatial-controls.png "Map component displayed next to its Properties pane")

Some properties are only available on the **Advanced** tab in the **Properties** pane, in the **More options** section.

| Property | Description | Type | Location |
| - | - | - | - |
| Data source(Items) | Data source (table) that lists a predefined set of longitudes and latitudes to display as map pin on the map when it's loaded.
