# Create a canvas app from a template

Create a canvas app automatically based on a template for a specific scenario, such as tracking budgets and scheduling vacations, and then run the app to understand its default behavior.

To create an app from a template, you need a cloud-storage account (such as DropBox, OneDrive, or Google Drive) to store the template's sample data.

If you don't have a license for Power Apps, you can [sign up for free](../signup-for-powerapps.md).

## Create an app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Select **+ Create** from the left-pane.

1. Scroll down to **Start from template** section, and choose the template of your choice for canvas apps.

1. Update the app name, and then select **Create** to open the app in Power Apps Studio. For example, the following shows creating an app using the **Power Apps Training for Office** template.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may be prompted to create, or allow the connection using a connector that app you select is configured to use.

## Run the app

An app from a template opens in Power Apps Studio, where you'll spend most of your time customizing. Before you make any changes to the app, explore how the app works in **Preview** mode.

1. Press F5 to open the app in **Preview** mode. Alternatively, you can also select the play button on the top-right corner of the screen.

    The app is populated with sample data to demonstrate the functionality of the app.

1. Explore the app's default behavior by creating, updating, and deleting sample data, and then verify that the data in your cloud-storage account reflects your changes.

1. Return to the default workspace by pressing Esc (or by selecting **X** icon near the upper-right corner).

## Next steps

1. Press Ctrl-S, give your app a name, and then select **Save** to save your app to the cloud.

1. [Share your app](share-app.md) with other people in your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you share an app, make sure that the people with whom you're sharing it have access to the data. For example, you must [share an Excel or other file](share-app-data.md) in a cloud-storage account.
