1. From the home screen select, **Start with an app template** tile.
1. If your data is stored in Dataverse, select **From Dataverse**. Or choose from one of the external data sources:
      - **From SharePoint**
      - **From Excel**
      - **From SQL**

1. Select the data that will appear in your app. When you're ready, select **Create app**.

The app you created opens in Power Apps Studio, where you can customize it. Before you make any changes to the app, explore how the app works in [Preview](preview-app.md) mode.

1. Press F5 to open the app in preview mode. Alternatively, you can also select the play button on the top-right corner of the screen to [preview the app](preview-app.md).

1. Explore the app's default behavior by creating, updating, and deleting sample data, and then verify that the data in your cloud-storage account reflects your changes.

1. Return to the default workspace by pressing Esc (or by selecting **X** icon near the upper-right corner).

## Next steps

1. Press Ctrl-S, give your app a name, and then select **Save** to save your app to the cloud.

1. [Share your app](share-app.md) with other people in your organization.
