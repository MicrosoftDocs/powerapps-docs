# Create a canvas app from a template

Creating a canvas app using templates in Power Apps is a streamlined and efficient way to develop applications tailored to your needs. With templates, you can quickly create a mobile app with three screens or choose from various templates designed for real-world scenarios with fictitious data. These templates come with prebuilt layouts, controls, and sample data, allowing you to focus on customizing the app to meet your specific requirements.


## Create a three-screen mobile app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. From the home screen, select the **Start with an app template** tile.
1. If your data is stored in [Dataverse](data-platform-create-app-scratch.md), select **From Dataverse**. Or choose from one of the external data sources:
      - **From SharePoint**
      - **From Excel**
      - **From SQL**

1. Select the data that will appear in your app. When ready, select **Create app**.

1. The app opens in [Power Apps Studio](power-apps-studio.md), where you can customize it.

1. Preview the app by pressing F5 or selecting the play button near the upper-right corner.

1. When ready, [save and publish](save-publish-app.md) the app.

## Use other templates to create an app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. On the home screen, select the **Start from template** tile.

1. Select a template from the list of **other app templates**.

1. Update the **App name**, then select **Next**.

1. Select **Make my own app** to connect the app to data storage, such as OneDrive.

    :::image type="content" source="media/open-and-run-a-sample-app/make-my-own-app.png" alt-text="Make my own app.":::

1. After you select or connect to storage from the available choices, select **Done**.

The app opens in [Power Apps Studio](power-apps-studio.md) where you can customize it.

1. Preview the app by pressing F5 or selecting the play button near the upper-right corner.

When you're ready, [save and publish](save-publish-app.md) the app.
