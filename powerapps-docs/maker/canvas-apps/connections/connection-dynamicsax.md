# Connect from Microsoft Power Apps to Dynamics AX
![Dynamics AX Online](./media/connection-dynamicsax/dynamics-ax.png)

Use this connection to easily build apps that read, update, and delete data from these versions of Dynamics AX:

•    Dynamics AX Update1 + [hotfix-KB article](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Resolved?kb=3175021&bugId=3762232&qc=75f75fb7cb5de685683dafada9bdc618a7674bc4e299935b567a28ac02489b5c)

•    Dynamics AX Update 2 and later

For information about how to create an app, see [Generate an app automatically](../get-started-create-from-data.md) or [Create an app from scratch](../get-started-create-from-blank.md). These topics are written for Excel, but the same principles apply to Dynamics AX.

For information about how to add data from Dynamics AX to an existing app, see [Add a data connection](../add-data-connection.md).

See the [list of available connections](../connections-list.md), and learn how to [manage connections](../add-manage-connections.md) in Power Apps.

### Next steps
* Learn how to [show data from a data source](../add-gallery.md).
* Learn how to [view details and create or update records](../add-form.md).
