# Connect to Power BI from Power Apps
![Power BI](./media/connection-powerbi/powerbiicon.png)

Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools to analyze data and share insights. Monitor your business and get answers quickly with rich dashboards available on every device. In your app, you can check the status of the data alerts that you have set up in the Power BI service. For more information on data alerts in Power BI, head to the [documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-set-data-alerts).

This topic shows you how to use the Power BI connection in an app, and lists the available functions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI connection is not [delegable](../delegation-overview.md).

## Prerequisites
* [Sign up](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc)
* Add the Power BI [connection](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/add-manage-connections/)
* Create an app from a [template](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/get-started-test-drive/), from [data](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/get-started-create-from-data/), or from [scratch](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/get-started-create-from-blank/)

## Use the Power BI connection in your app
### List the alerts that you've set up in the Power BI service
1. On the **Insert** menu, select **Gallery**, and add any of the **Text galleries**.
2. To show the current user's alerts, set the [Items](../controls/properties-core.md) property of the gallery to the following formula:

   `PowerBI.GetAlerts()`

The gallery will update with the list of alerts. For each alert, you will receive the alert name, the ID number of the alert, and the ID of the group workspace in which the alert was configured. You will need the alert ID to get further information about the alert.

### View the status of an alert
To view the status of the alert, call the CheckAlertStatus function with the alert ID obtained from the step above.

The alert ID can be passed in either as a literal string (e.g. "1234") or as a reference to a gallery section populated using the GetAlerts() call (e.g. Gallery1.Selected.alertId)

To proceed, add a label, and then set its [Text](../controls/properties-core.md) property to one of these formulas:

* `PowerBI.CheckAlertStatus( /* alert ID that you received from GetAlert */ ).alertTitle`
* `PowerBI.CheckAlertStatus( /* alert ID that you received from GetAlert */ ).currentTileValue`
* `PowerBI.CheckAlertStatus( /* alert ID that you received from GetAlert */ ).alertThreshold`
* `PowerBI.CheckAlertStatus( /* alert ID that you received from GetAlert */ ).isAlertTriggered`

The label will update with the current status of the alert.
