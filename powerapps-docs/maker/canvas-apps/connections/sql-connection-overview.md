# Connect to SQL Server from Power Apps overview

There are different ways to connect to data in SQL Server in your app, using Power Fx formulas. You can access data directly or use a view or stored procedures to create, update, or delete data in your app.

## Prerequisites

To access data directly, you can create a *Start with data* app for your SQL Server data. This method lets you get a basic, working app that you can modify with views and stored procedures.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and go to the **Apps** page.
1. Select **New app** > **Start with data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-connection/new-app-start-with-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to create an app by starting with data under the New app menu.":::
1. From the **Start with data** page, choose **Connect external data**.
1. Under **Choose a data set to start** select **From SQL**.

   If you have an existing SQL Server connection, it loads.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't already have a SQL Server connection, you're prompted to create one.
1. Select your SQL connection.
1. Enter your **Server** name and **Database name**, then choose **Connect**. Choose a table from the list of tables that appear.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sql-connection/sql-server-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create an app page where you can choose a SQL Server connection, including a table.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only one connection is shown at a time. To use a different connection, select the **...** overflow menu on your SQL connection, then find a new one or create a new SQL connection.

1. Select **Create app**.

## Access data

Once your app is connected to SQL Server, you can access data: [Access data in SQL Server](sql-connection-access-data.md).

## View results

To view the results of your SQL queries, see: [View results in SQL Server](sql-connection-view-results.md).

## Power Apps data type mappings

| SQL Server | Power Apps |
| --- | --- |
| `bigint`, `decimal`, `int`, `money`, `numeric`, `smallint`, `smallmoney`, `tinyint`, `float`, `real` | Number |
| `char`, `nchar`, `varchar`, `nvarchar`, `text`, `ntext` | Text |
| `bit` | Boolean |
| `date`, `datetime`, `datetime2`, `smalldatetime`, `datetimeoffset`, `time` | DateTime |
| `uniqueidentifier` | Guid |

> [!NOTE]
> If a SQL Server data type doesn't appear in the previous table, that data type isn't supported.
> Unsupported data types include the following examples: `binary()`, `varbinary()`, `image`, `cursor`,
> `rowversion`, `hierarchyid`, `sql_variant xml`, Spatial Geometry Types, Spatial Geography Types, and table.

## Power Apps functions and operations delegable to SQL Server

Power Apps can delegate Power Fx query operations (for example, Filter) to the back-end data source for processing. Delegation allows the back-end data service (for example, SQL Server) to do the filtering work so that only a few records must be transferred to your device. 

This table shows which operations are delegable to SQL Server by data type. Expressions joined with `And`, `Or`, and `Not` are delegable.


| Operation or function    | Number | Text    | Boolean | DateTime | Guid |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----    | ------- | -------- | ---- |
| `*, +, -, /`             | Yes    | -       | -       | No       | -    |
| `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`     | Yes    | No      | No      | Yes      | -    |
| `=`, `<>`                | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      | Yes  |
| `Average`                | Yes    | -       | -       | -        | -    |
| `EndsWith`               | -      | Yes [1] | -       | -        | -    |
| `Filter`                 | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes [2]  | Yes  |
| `In` (substring)         | -      | Yes [3] | -       | -        | -    |
| `IsBlank` [4]            | No     | No      | No      | No       | No   |
| `Len` (length)           | -      | Yes [5] | -       | -        | -    |
| `Lookup`                 | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      | Yes  |
| `Max`                    | Yes    | -       | -       | No       | -    |
| `Min`                    | Yes    | -       | -       | No       | -    |
| `Search`                 | No     | Yes     | No      | No       | -    |
| `Sort`                   | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      | -    |
| `SortByColumns`          | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      | -    |
| `StartsWith`             | -      | Yes [6] | -       | -        | -    |
| `Sum`                    | Yes    | -       | -       | -        | -    |
| `UpdateIf, RemoveIf` [7] | Yes    | Yes     | Yes     | Yes      | Yes  |

### Notes

[1] Supported for `(EndsWith(\<column>, "string value"))` but not for `(EndsWith("string value", \<column>))`. If a char(10) column has a value of "hello", `EndsWith(\<column>, "llo")` returns false, by design. A char(10) column has 10 characters.

[2] Direct date filters don't work for SQL Server with an on premise Data Gateway. However, you can create a calculated column that works. For example, you can create: <br>`ALTER TABLE myTable ADD DateAsInt AS (YEAR([date]) * 10000 + MONTH([date]) * 100 + DAY([date]))` <br>And then filter on the calculated number column. 

[3] Supported for `("string value" in \<column>)`, but not for `(\<column> in "string value")`.

[4] An expression such as `Filter('[dbo].[MyOrders]', !IsBlank(CustomerId))` won't delegate to the server. However, you can use an expression such as `Filter('[dbo].[MyOrders]', CustomerId <> Blank())`, which does delegate to the server and is semantically close. The difference is that the second expression won't treat the empty string ("") as empty. Although the expressions aren't equivalent, the latter might work for your purposes. You can't use this method for the Guid data type. 

[5] Power Apps delegates the `Len` function, but the behavior might not work as you expect. In SQL Server, a char(10) column with value "hello" always has a length of 10. However, Power Apps treats that string as having a length of 5, which may cause discrepancies and confusion. Don't use `char`/`nchar` on SQL server, but use `varchar`/`nvarchar` instead.

[6] Supported for `(StartsWith(\<column>, "string value"))`, but not for `(StartsWith("string value", \<column>))`

[7] UpdateIf and RemoveIf work locally but simulate delegation to a limit of 500/2000 records. They successively bring down records beyond the initial 500/2000 record limit. Records that meet the **If** condition are collected. A maximum of 500/2000 records are collected and changed per execution.
