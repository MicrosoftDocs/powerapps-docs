# Connect to Dynamics 365 from Power Apps

If you want to connect to Dynamics 365 Business Central, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, or Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps, choose the relevant connector.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Dynamics 365 connector is deprecated. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 connector deprecation announcement](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#dynamics-365-connector-is-deprecated).
>
> - Use the [Microsoft Dataverse connector](connection-common-data-service.md) when connecting to the Microsoft Dataverse used for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation. 
> - To convert your app that uses the deprecated Dynamics 365 connector, go to [Converting canvas apps with the Dynamics 365 connector](../use-native-cds-connector.md#converting-canvas-apps-with-the-dynamics-365-connector).
