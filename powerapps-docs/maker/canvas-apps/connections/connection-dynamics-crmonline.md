# Connect to Dynamics 365 from Power Apps

If you want to connect to Dynamics 365 Business Central, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, or Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations apps, choose the relevant connector.

> The Dynamics 365 connector is deprecated. For more information, see [Dynamics 365 connector deprecation announcement](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#dynamics-365-connector-is-deprecated).
