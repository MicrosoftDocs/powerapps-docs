# System requirements, limits, and configuration values for canvas apps
This topic contains device platform and web browser requirements, limits, and configuration values for canvas apps.

## Supported platforms for running canvas apps using the Power Apps mobile app

| **Minimum required** | **Recommended** |
| --- | --- |
| iOS 12 or later |iOS 12 or later|
| Android 7 or later |Android 7 or later |

> [!NOTE]
> - On October 16, 2020 we will no longer support iOS 12. After October 16, 2020 iOS 13 or later will be supported. 
> - We currently don't support new features on Windows platform for [Power Apps mobile app](/powerapps/user/run-app-client). Features such as the Improved Microsoft Dataverse option, and guest access are not available on this platform. We recommend using a web player on Windows to leverage the full set of capabilities. Updates to the Power Apps mobile app for Windows platform will be announced in future.
> - Canvas apps running on Windows platform must use the legacy Microsoft Dataverse connector. A [warning is displayed](use-native-cds-connector.md) for apps that still use the legacy connector, but using it for Windows platform is supported.

## Request limits
These limits apply to each single outgoing request:

| Name | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Timeout |180 Seconds |
| Retry attempts |4 |

> [!NOTE]
> The retry value may vary. For certain error conditions, it's not necessary to retry.

## IP addresses
Requests from Power Apps use IP addresses that depend on the region of the [environment](../../administrator/environments-overview.md) that the app is in. We don't publish fully qualified domain names available for Power Apps scenarios.

Calls made from an API connected through an app (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from the IP address specified later in this topic.

For example, use these addresses when you must allow IP addresses for an Azure SQL database.
