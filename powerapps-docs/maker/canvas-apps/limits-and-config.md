> [!NOTE]
> The retry value may vary. For certain error conditions, it's not necessary to retry.

## IP addresses
Requests from PowerApps use IP addresses that depend on the region of the [environment](../../administrator/environments-overview.md) that the app is in. We don't publish fully qualified domain names available for PowerApps scenarios.

Calls made from an API connected through an app (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from the IP address specified later in this topic.

You should use these addresses if, for example, you must whitelist IP addresses for an Azure SQL database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>   If you have existing configurations, please update them as soon as possible before September 30, 2018 so they include and match the IP addresses in this list for the regions where your PowerApps apps exist.

## Size limits

You can find information about size limits on text, hyperlinks, images, and media in [Data types](functions/data-types.md#text-hyperlink-image-and-media).

## PowerApps per app plan

PowerApps per app plan allows individual users to run 2 applications on single portal for a specific business scenario based on the full capabilities of PowerApps. This plan provides an easy way for users to get started with the platform before broader scale adoption.

After an admin allocates PowerApps per app plan to an environment, they're assigned to users by default when app is shared with them.

Follow these steps to turn off the assigning per app plans for users when an app is shared with them:

- Choose the **App**.
- Select **Settings**.
- Change the **Auto assign per app passes** toggle under **Pass assignment**.

The **Auto assign per app passes** toggle appears in all app setting.

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling the per app plan is currently available for only canvas apps.  Model-driven apps and Portals will have this ability in the future.
