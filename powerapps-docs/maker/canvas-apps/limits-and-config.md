# System requirements, limits, and configuration values for canvas apps
This article contains information on supported device platforms, web browser requirements, limits, and configuration values for canvas apps. 

## Supported platforms for running canvas apps using the Power Apps mobile app

> [!NOTE]
> - As of October 16, 2020, we no longer support iOS 12. Only iOS 13 or later is supported. 
> - We currently don't support new features on Windows platform for [Power Apps mobile app](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/run-canvas-and-model-apps-on-mobile). Features such as the Improved Microsoft Dataverse option and guest access are not available on this platform. We recommend using a web player on Windows to leverage the full set of capabilities. Updates to the Power Apps mobile app for Windows platform will be announced in future.
> - Canvas apps running on Windows platform must use the legacy Microsoft Dataverse connector. A [warning is displayed](use-native-cds-connector.md) for apps that still use the legacy connector, but using it for Windows platform is supported.

> [!NOTE]
> The retry value may vary. For certain error conditions, it's not necessary to retry.

## IP addresses

Requests from Power Apps use IP addresses that depend on the region of the [environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) that the app is in. We don't publish fully qualified domain names available for Power Apps scenarios.

Calls made from an API connected through an app (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from these [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

## Required services
This list identifies all services to which Power Apps Studio talks and their usages. Your network must **not** block these services.

## Embedding limits for canvas apps

Power Apps doesn't support the nested embedding of canvas apps in native desktop, mobile, or other non-browser clients.

The following table shows some of the examples where embedding a canvas app isn't supported:

| Canvas apps embedded to | Unsupported client |
| - | - |
| A SharePoint page that is added as a tab in a Microsoft Teams channel | <ul> <li> Teams desktop </li> <li> Teams mobile </li> </ul> |
| A Power BI report that is added to a Teams team, or a SharePoint site | <ul> <li> Teams desktop </li> <li> Teams mobile </li> <li> SharePoint mobile </li> </ul> |
| A model-driven form that is added to Teams | <ul> <li> Teams desktop </li> <li> Teams mobile </li> </ul> |

## Size limits
