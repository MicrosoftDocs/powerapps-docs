## Request limits
These limits apply to each single outgoing request:

| Name | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Timeout |180 Seconds |
| Retry attempts |4 |

> [!NOTE]
> The retry value may vary. For certain error conditions, it's not necessary to retry.

## IP addresses
Requests from Power Apps use IP addresses that depend on the region of the [environment](../../administrator/environments-overview.md) that the app is in. We don't publish fully qualified domain names available for Power Apps scenarios.

Calls made from an API connected through an app (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from the IP address specified later in this topic.

You should use these addresses if, for example, you must allow IP addresses for an Azure SQL database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have existing configurations, please update them as soon as possible before September 30, 2018 so they include and match the IP addresses in this list for the regions where your Power Apps apps exist.
