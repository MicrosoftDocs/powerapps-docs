| Metric | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **App open success rate**  | Indicates the percentage of app launch attempts that successfully allowed end-users to access the app. This metric is calculated once every 24 hours.|
| **Time to interact**  | Measures the time end-users wait to access the first screen of an app. It doesn't include the time users wait to see all data presented on the first screen, such as filling in rows of a gallery. This metric is calculated every 24 hours and is measured using percentiles, with the 75th percentile being reported. |
| **Time to full load**  | Measures the time end-users wait to see all data displayed on the first screen of an app. In the app launch lifecycle, this metric follows the **Time to interact** phase. This metric is calculated every 24 hours and is measured using percentiles, with the 75th percentile being reported.|


### View metrics and recommendations for an app

  When you select an app on the  **Monitor** page a side pane opens and display more data for each metric, including a data chart for the last 30 days.

1. On **Monitor** page, select an app.
