# Understand record references and polymorphic lookups in canvas apps

When you wrote a research paper in school, you probably provided a list of your references at the end. You didn't include a copy of the actual background material you used but rather a web link, book title and author, or other information so that someone could track down the original source. You mixed different kinds of sources in a single list, newspaper articles next to audio recordings, each with their own specific details for a proper citation. For example, Wikipedia articles often include a [long list of references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#References).

In canvas apps, you often work with copies of records downloaded from data sources. You use the [**LookUp**](functions/function-filter-lookup.md) and [**Filter**](functions/function-filter-lookup.md) functions and the [**Gallery**](controls/control-gallery.md) control's **Selected** property to identify the specific record that you want. All the records from **Filter** or **Selected** will be of the same entity type, so you can use fields with a simple .*Field* notation. These copies often include reference information so you can use the [**Patch**](functions/function-patch.md) function to update the original source.

Canvas apps also support *record references*. Much like a research-paper reference, a record reference refers to a record without including a complete copy of it. Such a reference can refer to a record in any entity. Also like research-paper references, you can mix records from different entities in a single column.

Many operations on record references are identical to working with records. You can compare record references to each other and to full records. You can set a record reference's value with the **Patch** function just as you would a lookup with a full record.

There is one important usage difference: you can't directly access the fields of a record reference without first establishing to which entity it refers. This is because canvas apps require that all types be known when you write formulas. Because you don't know the type of a record reference until the app is running, you can't use the simple .*Field* notation directly. You must first dynamically determine the entity type with the [**IsType**](functions/function-astype-istype.md) function and then use .*Field* notation on the result of the [**AsType**](functions/function-astype-istype.md) function.

*Entity type* refers to the schema of each record in an entity. Each entity has a unique set of fields with different names and data types. Each record of the entity inherits that structure; two records have the same entity type if they come from the same entity.

## Polymorphic lookups

Microsoft Dataverse supports relationships between records. Each record in the **Accounts** entity has a **Primary Contact** lookup field to a record in the **Contacts** entity. The lookup can only refer to a record in **Contacts** and can't refer to a record in, say, the **Teams** entity. That last detail is important because you always know what fields will be available for the lookup.

Dataverse also supports polymorphic lookups, which can refer to a record from any entity in a set. For example, the **Owner** field can refer to a record in the **Users** entity or the **Teams** entity. The same lookup field in different records could refer to records in different entities. In this case, you don't always know what fields will be available.

Canvas record references were designed for working with polymorphic lookups in Dataverse. You can also use record references outside of this context, which is how the two concepts differ.

In the next section, you'll start to explore these concepts by working with the **Owner** lookup.

## Show the fields of a record owner

Every entity in Dataverse includes an **Owner** field. This field can't be removed, you can't add another, and it always requires a value.

To show that field in the **Account** entity:

1. Open [this Power Apps site](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. In the left navigation bar, select **Data** > **Entities**.
1. In the list of entities, select **Account**.
1. In the upper-right corner, open the filter list (which is set to **Default** by default), and then select **All**.
1. Scroll down until the **Owner** field appears.

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Owner field on Account entity](media/working-with-references/owner-field.png)

This lookup field can refer to a record from either the **Teams** entity or the **Users** entity. Not every record in these entities has permission to be an **Owner**; check the supported roles if you run into a problem.

This graphic shows a simple gallery of **Accounts**, where the **Accounts** entity has been added to the app as a data source:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Accounts shown in a Gallery control](media/working-with-references/accounts-gallery.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughout this topic, the graphics show some names and other values that aren't part of the sample data that ships with Dataverse. The steps accurately demonstrate how to configure controls for a particular result, but your experience will vary based on the data for your organization.

To show the owner of each account in the gallery, you might be tempted to use the formula **ThisItem.Owner.Name**. However, the name field in the **Team** entity is **Team Name**, and the name field in the **User** entity is **Full Name**. The app can't know which type of lookup you're working with until you run the app, and it can vary between records in the **Accounts** entity.

You need a formula that can adapt to this variance. You also need to add the data sources for the entity types that **Owner** could be (in this case, **Users** and **Teams**). Add these three data sources to your app:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Accounts, Teams, and Users entities in the Data pane](media/working-with-references/accounts-datasources.png)

With these data sources in place, use this formula to display the name of either a user or a team:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsType( ThisItem.Owner, Teams ),
    "Team: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Teams ).'Team Name',
    "User: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Users ).'Full Name' )
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Accounts shown in a Gallery control with Owner field displayed](media/working-with-references/accounts-displayowner.png)

In this formula, the **IsType** function tests the **Owner** field against the **Teams** entity. If it's of that entity type, the **AsType** function casts it to a **Team** record. At this point, you can access all the fields of the **Teams** entity, including **Team Name**, by using the *.Field* notation. If **IsType** determines that the **Owner** isn't a record in the **Teams** entity, that field must be a record in the **Users** entity because the **Owner** field is required (can't be *blank*).

To use any fields of a record reference, you must first use the **AsType** function to cast it to a specific entity type. You can't access fields directly from the **Owner** field because the system doesn't know what entity type you want to use.

The **AsType** function returns an error if the **Owner** field doesn't match the entity type being requested, so you can use the **IfError** function to simplify this formula. First, turn on the experimental feature **Formula-level error management**:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Experimental switch to turn on formula-level error management](media/working-with-references/accounts-iferror.png)

Then replace the previous formula with this one:

```powerapps-dot
IfError(
    "Team: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Teams ).'Team Name',
    "User: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Users ).'Full Name' )
```

## Filter based on an owner

Congratulationsâ€”you've finished the hardest aspect of working with a record reference. Other use cases are more straightforward because they don't access fields of the record. As a case in point, take filtering, which you'll explore in this section.

Add a **Combo box** control above the gallery, and set these properties of the new control:

- **Items**: `Users`
- **SelectMultiple**: `false`

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Added combo-box control above gallery with Items property set to Users](media/working-with-references/filter-insert-combobox.png)

To filter the gallery by a specific user selected from this combo box, set the gallery's **Items** property to this formula:

```powerapps-dot
Filter( Accounts, Owner = ComboBox1.Selected )
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Filtered gallery based on value set in the combo-box control](media/working-with-references/filter-accounts.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The instructions in this topic are accurate if you follow the steps exactly. However, any formula that refers to a control by its name fails if the control has a different name. If you delete and add a control of the same type, the number at the end of the control's name changes. For any formula that shows an error, confirm that it contains the correct names of all controls.

You don't need to use **IsType** or **AsType** because you're comparing record references to other record references or to full records. The app knows the entity type of **ComboBox1.Selected** because it's derived from the **Users** entity. Accounts for which the owner is a team won't match the filter criterion.

You can get a little fancier by supporting filtering by either a user or a team.

1. Make some space near the top of the screen by resizing the gallery and moving the combo box, insert a [**Radio** control](controls/control-radio.md) above the gallery, and then set these properties for the new control:

    - **Items**: `[ "All", "Users", "Teams" ]`
    - **Layout**: `Layout.Horizontal`

1. For the **Combo box** control, set this property (if the combo box disappears, select **Users** in the radio control):

    - **Visible**: `Radio1.Selected.Value = "Users"`

1. Copy and paste the **Combo box** control, move the copy directly over the original, and then set these properties for the copy:

    - **Items**: `Teams`
    - **Visible**: `Radio1.Selected.Value = "Teams"`

    The app will display only one combo box at a time, depending on the state of the radio control. Because they're directly above one another, they'll appear to be the same control that changes its contents.

1. Finally, set the **Items** property of the **Gallery** control to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Filter( Accounts,
        Radio1.Selected.Value = "All"
        Or (Radio1.Selected.Value = "Users" And Owner = ComboBox1.Selected)
        Or (Radio1.Selected.Value = "Teams" And Owner = ComboBox1_1.Selected)
    )
    ```

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Filtered gallery showing all records or a specific user or team](media/working-with-references/filter-combobox.png)

With these changes, you can show all records or filter them based on either a user or a team:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation showing different filtered results based on the radio control and combo boxes](media/working-with-references/filter-allthree.gif)

The formula is fully delegable. The portion that's comparing the radio-button values is a constant across all records and is evaluated before the rest of the filter is sent to Dataverse.

If you want to filter on the type of the owner, you can use the **IsType** function, but it's not yet delegable.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Filter by owner type by using IsType](media/working-with-references/filter-bytype.png)

## Update the owner by using Patch

You can update the **Owner** field in the same manner as any other lookup. To set the currently selected account's owner to the first team:

```powerapps-dot
Patch( Accounts, Gallery1.Selected, { Owner: First( Teams ) } )
```

This approach doesn't differ from a normal lookup because the app knows the type of **First( Teams )**. If you want the first user instead, replace that portion with **First( Users )**. The **Patch** function knows that the **Owner** field can be set to either of these two entity types.

To add this capability to the app:

1. In the **Tree view** pane, select the **Radio** control and the two **Combo box** controls at the same time.

1. On the ellipsis menu, select **Copy these items**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Copy of multiple controls using the tree view](media/working-with-references/patch-copy.png)

1. On the same menu, select **Paste**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Paste of multiple controls using the tree view](media/working-with-references/patch-paste.png)

1. Move the copied controls to the right of the gallery.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Moved copied controls to the right of the gallery](media/working-with-references/patch-position.png)

1. Select the copied **Radio** control, and then change these properties:

    - Items: `[ "Users", "Teams" ]`
    - Default: `If( IsType( Gallery1.Selected.Owner, Users ), "Users", "Teams" )`

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Removed the all choice from the radio control](media/working-with-references/patch-noall.png) 

1. In the **Radio** control, select **Users** so that the **Combo box** control that lists users is visible.

1. Select the visible **Combo box** control, and then set the **DefaultSelectedItems** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If( IsType( Gallery1.Selected.Owner, Users ),
        AsType( Gallery1.Selected.Owner, Users ),
        Blank()
    )
    ```

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Default property set for the Users combo box](media/working-with-references/patch-default-users.png)

1. In the **Radio** control, select **Teams** so that the **Combo box** control that lists teams is visible.

1. Select the **Radio** control to take selection away from the now-invisible **Combo box** control for users.

1. Select the visible **Combo box** control for teams, and then set its **DefaultSelectedItems** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If( IsType( Gallery1.Selected.Owner, Teams ),
        AsType( Gallery1.Selected.Owner, Teams ),
        Blank()
    )
    ```

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Default property set for the Teams combo box](media/working-with-references/patch-default-teams.png)

1. Insert a **Button** control, move it under the **Combo box** control, and then set the button's **Text** property to `"Patch Owner"`.

1. Set the **OnSelect** property of the button to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Patch( Accounts, Gallery1.Selected,
        { Owner: If( Radio1_1.Selected.Value = "Users",
                     ComboBox1_2.Selected,
                     ComboBox1_3.Selected ) } )
    ```

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Formula set on Button control](media/working-with-references/patch-button.png)

The copied **Radio** and **Combo box** controls show the owner for the currently selected account in the gallery. With the same controls, you can set the owner of the account to any team or user by selecting the button:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation showing patch of Owner with either a User or a Team](media/working-with-references/patch-allthree.gif)

## Show the owner by using a form

You can show an **Owner** field inside a form by adding a custom card. As of this writing, you can't change the value of the field with a form control.

1. Insert an **Edit form** control, and then resize and move it to the lower-right corner.

1. On the **Properties** tab near the right side of the screen, open the **Data source** list, and then select **Accounts**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Form control showing additional fields with blank values](media/working-with-references/form-insert.png)  

1. Set the form's **Item** property to `Gallery1.Selected`.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Form control showing additional fields populated from the selected item in the gallery](media/working-with-references/form-item.png)

1. On the **Properties** tab near the right side of the screen, select **Edit fields**.

1. In the **Fields** pane, select the ellipsis, and then select **Add a custom card**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Command for adding a custom card](media/working-with-references/form-customcard.png)

    The new card appears at the bottom of the form control.

1. Resize the card as needed to show all the text.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Inserted custom card, blank](media/working-with-references/form-inserted-customcard.png)

1. Insert a **Label** control into the custom card, and then set the label's **Text** property to the formula that you used in the gallery:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If( IsType( ThisItem.Owner, Teams ),
        "Team: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Teams ).'Team Name',
        "User: " & AsType( ThisItem.Owner, Users ).'Full Name' )
    ```

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Custom card showing the Owner field in a label control](media/working-with-references/form-displayowner.png)

For each selection in the gallery, more fields of the account, including the record's owner, appear in the form. If you change the owner by using the **Patch** button, the form control also shows that change.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation showing the form control responding to changes in the gallery](media/working-with-references/form-allthree.gif)

## Show the fields of a customer

In Dataverse, the **Customer** lookup field is another polymorphic lookup that's very similar to **Owner**.

**Owner** is limited to one per entity, but entities can include zero, one, or more **Customer** lookup fields. The **Contacts** system entity includes the **Company Name** field, which is a **Customer** lookup field.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Contact entity showing Company Name field as a Customer data type that isn't required](media/working-with-references/customer-companyname.png)

You can add more **Customer** lookup fields to an entity by selecting the **Customer** data type for a new field.

![Customer data type from the list of data types when creating a field](media/working-with-references/customer-datatype.png)

A **Customer** lookup field can refer to a record from either the **Accounts** entity or the **Contacts** entity. You'll use the **IsType** and **AsType** functions with these entities, so now is a good time to add them as data sources (you can leave **Teams** and **Users** in place).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Accounts, Teams, Users, and Contacts entities in the Data pane](media/working-with-references/customer-datasources.png)

The treatment of the **Customer** and **Owner** fields is so similar that you can literally copy the app (**File** > **Save as**, and then specify a different name) and make these simple replacements:

| Location | **Owner** sample | **Customer** sample |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Throughout | **Owner** | **'Customer Name'** |
| Throughout | **Users** | **Accounts** |
| Throughout | **Teams** | **Contacts** |
| Gallery's **Items** property | **Accounts** | **Contacts** |
| Form's **Items** property | **Accounts** | **Contacts** |
| The first argument of **Patch**<br>in the button's **OnSelect** property | **Accounts** | **Contacts** |
| Filter radio's **Items** property | **[&nbsp;"All",&nbsp;"Users",&nbsp;"Teams"&nbsp;]** | **[&nbsp;"All",&nbsp;"Accounts",&nbsp;"Contacts"&nbsp;]** |
| Patch radio's **Items** property | **[ "Users", "Teams" ]** | **[ "Accounts", "Contacts" ]** |
| Combo box's **Visible** property | **"Users"** and **"Teams"** | **"Accounts"** and **"Contacts"** |

For example, the new gallery should have this **Items** property:

```powerapps-dot
Filter( Contacts,
    Radio1.Selected.Value = "All"
    Or (Radio1.Selected.Value = "Accounts" And 'Company Name' = ComboBox1.Selected)
    Or (Radio1.Selected.Value = "Contacts" And 'Company Name' = ComboBox1_1.Selected)
)
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Customer app derived from the Owner app with simple changes applied](media/working-with-references/customer-simple-update.png)

Two important differences between **Customer** and **Owner** require an update to the formulas inside the gallery and the form:

1. One-to-many relationships between **Accounts** and **Contacts** take precedence when you refer to these entity types by name. Instead of **Accounts**, use **\[\@Accounts]**; instead of **Contacts**, use **\[\@Contacts]**. By using the [global disambiguation operator](functions/operators.md#disambiguation-operator), you ensure that you're referring to the entity type in **IsType** and **AsType**. This problem exists only in the record context of the gallery and form controls.

1. The **Owner** field must have a value, but **Customer** fields can be *blank*. To show the correct result without a type name, test for this case with the [**IsBlank** function](functions/function-isblank-isempty.md), and show an empty text string instead.

Both of these changes are in the same formula, which appears in the custom card in the form, as well as in the **Text** property of the gallery's label control:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsBlank( ThisItem.'Company Name' ), "",
    IsType( ThisItem.'Company Name', Accounts ),
        "Account: " & AsType( ThisItem.'Company Name', Accounts ).'Account Name',
    "Contact: " & AsType( ThisItem.'Company Name', Contacts ).'Full Name'
)
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Update to Text property of subtitle label control in the gallery](media/working-with-references/customer-update.png)

With these changes, you can view and change the **Company Name** field in the **Contacts** entity.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation that shows how selecting a contact changes the other controls and the form](media/working-with-references/customer-allthree.gif)

## Understand Regarding lookup fields

The **Regarding** lookup field differs a little from those that you've already worked with in this topic. You'll start by applying the patterns that this topic described earlier, and then you'll learn other tricks.

You can start simply with the **Faxes** entity. This entity has a polymorphic **Regarding** lookup field, which can refer to **Accounts**, **Contacts**, and other entities. You can take the app for **Customers** and modify it for **Faxes**.

| Location | **Customer** sample | **Faxes** sample |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Throughout | **'Customer Name'** | **Regarding** |
| Gallery's **Items** property | **Contacts** | **Faxes** |
| Form's **Items** property | **Contacts** | **Faxes** |
| The first argument of **Patch**<br> in the button's **OnSelect** property | **Contacts** | **Faxes** |

Again, you'll need to add a data source: this time for **Faxes**. On the **View** tab, select **Data sources**:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Data pane showing Accounts, Teams, Users, Contacts, and Faxes entities](media/working-with-references/faxes-datasources.png)

An important difference for **Regarding** is that it isn't limited to **Accounts** and **Contacts**. In fact, the list of entities is extensible with custom entities. Most of the app can accommodate this point without modification, but you must update the formula for the label in the gallery and the form:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsBlank( ThisItem.Regarding ), "",
    IsType( ThisItem.Regarding, Accounts ),
        "Account: " & AsType( ThisItem.Regarding, Accounts ).'Account Name',
    IsType( ThisItem.Regarding, Contacts ),
        "Contacts: " & AsType( ThisItem.Regarding, Contacts ).'Full Name',
    ""
)
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Updated Text property for the subtitle control for Regarding lookups](media/working-with-references/regarding-label.png)

After you make these changes, you work with the **Regarding** lookup just as you did the **Owner** and **Customer** lookups.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation that shows how selecting an item in the gallery changes the other controls and the form](media/working-with-references/regarding-allthree.gif)

## Understand Regarding relationships

**Regarding** differs from **Owner** and **Customer** because the former involves a many-to-one relationship. By definition, a reverse, one-to-many relationship allows you to write **First( Accounts ).Faxes**.

Let's back up and look at the entity definitions. In Dataverse, entities such as **Faxes**, **Tasks**, **Emails**, **Notes**, **Phone Calls**, **Letters**, and **Chats** are designated as [*activities*](../../developer/data-platform/activity-entities.md). You can also create your own [custom activity entities](../../developer/data-platform/custom-activities.md). When you view or create an activity entity, its settings appear under **More settings**.

![Activity entity setting when creating an entity](media/working-with-references/activity-entitytype.png)

Other entities can be related to an activity entity if they're enabled as an *activity task* in the entity's settings. **Accounts**, **Contacts**, and many other standard entities are so designated (again, under **More settings**).

![Activity task setting when creating an entity](media/working-with-references/activity-entityuse.png)

All activity entities and activity-task entities have an implied relationship. If you change the filter to **All** at the top of the screen, select the **Faxes** entity, and then select the **Relationships** tab, all entities that can be a target of a **Regarding** lookup appear.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Relationships of the Faxes entity showing Regarding many-to-one relationships](media/working-with-references/activity-manytoone.png)

If you show the relationships for the **Accounts** entity, all the entities that can be a source of a **Regarding** lookup field appear.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Relationships of the Account entity showing Regarding one-to-many relationships](media/working-with-references/activity-onetomany.png)

What does it all mean?

- When you write formulas, you must consider that the list of activity entities isn't fixed, and you can create your own. The formula must appropriately handle an activity entity that you didn't expect.
- Activity tasks and activities have a one-to-many relationship. You can easily ask for all faxes that relate to an account.

To explore this concept in the app:

1. Add another screen.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Insert a blank screen](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-newscreen.png)

1. Insert a gallery control, resize it, and then move it to the left side of the screen.

1. On the **Properties** tab near the right side of the screen, set the gallery's **Items** to **Accounts**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Set Items to Accounts in property pane](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-accounts.png)

1. Set the gallery's layout to **Title**, and then set the title field to **Account Name**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Set Layout to Title for gallery control in the properties pane](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-account-name.png)

1. Add a second gallery, resize it, and then move it to the right side of the screen.

1. Set the new gallery's **Items** property to `Gallery2.Selected.Faxes`.

    This step returns the filtered list of faxes for a given account.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Set the Items property of the gallery that shows faxes](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-faxes.png)

1. Set the gallery's layout to **Title and subtitle**, and then set the title field to show the **Subject** field (which might be lowercase **subject**).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Set title to Subject field](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-subject.png)

As you select an item in the list of accounts, the list of faxes shows faxes for only that account.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Animation showing selection in the accounts gallery driving the list of faxes](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-allthree.gif)

## Activity entity

As the previous section describes, you can show all the faxes for an account. However, you can also show all the activities for an account, including faxes, email messages, phone calls, and other interactions.

For the latter scenario, you use the **Activity** entity. You can show this entity by turning on **All** in the upper-right corner to remove the filter from the list of entities.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![List of entities showing the Activity entity](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-entity.png)

The **Activity** entity is special. Whenever you add a record to the **Faxes** entity, the system also creates a record in the **Activity** entity with the fields that are common across all activity entities. Of those fields, **Subject** is one of the most interesting.

You can show all activities by changing only one line in the previous example. Replace `Gallery2.Selected.Faxes` with `Gallery2.Selected.Activities`.

> ![Change of Items property for the second gallery, changing from faxes to activities](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-gallery.png)

Records are coming from the **Activity** entity, but you can nevertheless use the **IsType** function to identify which kind of activity they are. Again, before you use **IsType** with an entity type, you must add the data source.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Data pane showing all the entities required for the IsType function](media/working-with-references/activity-datasources.png)

By using this formula, you can show the record type in a label control within the gallery:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsType( ThisItem, Faxes] ), "Fax",
    IsType( ThisItem, 'Phone Calls' ), "Phone Call",
    IsType( ThisItem, 'Email Messages' ), "Email Message",
    IsType( ThisItem, Chats ), "Chat",
    "Unknown"
)
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Set text property to formula to show information for faxes, phone calls, and other activities](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-type.png)

You can also use **AsType** to access the fields of the specific type. For example, this formula determines the type of each activity and, for phone calls, shows the phone number and call direction from the **Phone Numbers** entity:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsType( ThisItem, Faxes ), "Fax",
    IsType( ThisItem, 'Phone Calls' ),
       "Phone Call: " &
       AsType( ThisItem, 'Phone Calls' ).'Phone Number' &
       " (" & AsType( ThisItem, 'Phone Calls' ).Direction & ")",
    IsType( ThisItem, 'Email Messages' ), "Email Message",
    IsType( ThisItem, Chats ), "Chat",
    "Unknown"
)
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Expanded text property with more information for a phone call](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-phonecall.png)

As a result, the app shows a complete list of activities. The **Subject** field appears for all types of activities, whether the formula takes them into account or not. For types of activities that you know about, you can show their type names and type-specific information about each activity.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Completed screen showing information for different kinds of activities](media/working-with-references/activitypointer-complete.png)

## Notes entity

So far, all of the **Regarding** examples have been based on activities, but the **Notes** entity represents another case.

When you create an entity, you can enable attachments.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Enabling attachments and notes when creating an entity](media/working-with-references/notes-entity.png)

If you select the check box for enabling attachments, you'll create a **Regarding** relationship with the **Notes** entity, as this graphic shows for the **Accounts** entity:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Account entity showing relationship to Notes through a one-to-many relationship](media/working-with-references/notes-relationships.png)

Other than this difference, you use the **Regarding** lookup in the same manner in which you use activities. Entities that are enabled for attachments have a one-to-many relationship to **Notes**, as in this example:

`First( Accounts ).Notes`

> [!NOTE]
> As of this writing, the **Regarding** lookup isn't available for the **Notes** entity. You can't read or filter based on the **Regarding** field, and you can't set the field by using **Patch**.
>
> However, the reverse **Notes** one-to-many relationship is available, so you can filter a list of notes for a record that's enabled for attachments. You can also use the [**Relate**](functions/function-relate-unrelate.md) function to add a note to a record's **Notes** table, but the note must be created first, as in this example:
>
>`Relate( ThisItem.Notes, Patch( Notes, Defaults( Notes ), { Title: "A new note" } ) )`

## Activity parties

As of this writing, canvas apps don't support activity parties.
