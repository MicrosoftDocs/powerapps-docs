# Create a canvas app with data from a list

In this article, you can create a canvas app in Power Apps from Lists or SharePoint. You can create the app from within Power Apps or SharePoint. Alternatively, you can create the app based on a list in an on-premises SharePoint site if you [connect to it](connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md#create-a-sharepoint-connection) through a data gateway.

The app you create contains three screens:

- **Browse screen**: scroll through all items in the list.
- **Details screen**: show all information about a single item in the list.
- **Edit screen**: create an item or update information about an existing item.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create or view a list in SharePoint, you're automatically redirected to Microsoft Lists. The list can always be found in both Lists and SharePoint. Learn more in [What is a list in Microsoft 365?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-a-list-in-microsoft-365-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5)

## Prerequisites

You need access to SharePoint and Power Apps through a [subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering) to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/Microsoft365/all) and [Microsoft Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/productoffering/MicrosoftPowerPlatform/all).

## Create a list

1. [Create a list](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-0d397414-d95f-41eb-addd-5e6eff41b083) in Sharepoint or Lists named **SimpleList**.
1. In the list's **Title** column, add items for **Vanilla**, **Chocolate**, and **Strawberry**.

## Create an app in Power Apps

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. To create a single-page gallery app select **Start with a page design** > **Gallery connected to external data** > **From SharePoint**.
1. To create a three screen mobile app, select **Start with an app template** > **From SharePoint**.

   You see a SharePoint connection appear or are prompted to create a connection. To select a different connection, select on the **...** option to switch accounts or create a new connection.
1. Enter the SharePoint URL and then select **Connect**. Or, select a recent site.
1. Select a list and then select, **Create app**.

   Your app opens in Power Apps Studio where you can design, build, and manage your app. Learn more in [Understand Power Apps Studio](power-apps-studio.md).

1. Save your work by selecting the **Save** icon in the upper-right corner. Give your app a name, and then select **Save**.

## Create an app from a list

If you create an app from a list in SharePoint or Microsoft Lists, the app appears as a view of that list. You can also run the app on an iOS or Android device, in addition to a web browser.

1. Sign in to SharePoint: `https://yourorganizationname.sharepoint.com`

1. Open a list in either SharePoint or Microsoft Lists. If you open the list from SharePoint, you're taken to Lists to view the list.
1. Select **Integrate** > **Power Apps** > **Create an app**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/app-from-sharepoint/generate-new-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Integrate menu in Lists that lets you create an app in Power Apps.":::

   You're taken to Power Apps Studio and can see your list in an app as a vertical gallery on the **BrowseScreen1** screen.

1. Select the **Save** icon in the upper-right menu bar and name your app **SimpleApp**. Select **Save**.

## Manage your app

Once you create an app, you can play it, save, share, and publish it.
