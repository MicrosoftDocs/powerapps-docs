# Create a canvas app from a sample in Power Apps
In this quickstart, you'll create a canvas app from a sample so that you can explore design possibilities and discover concepts that you can apply as you develop your own canvas apps.

Each sample showcases a real-world scenario but uses fictitious data. 

If you don't have a license for Power Apps, you can [sign up for free](../signup-for-powerapps.md).

## Open a sample app
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. Select **All templates**.

1. Choose a sample app from the list of sample apps, such as **Cost Estimator**.

1. Update the app name and select **Create** to create the app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some sample apps may be available in only phone or tablet layouts. Read [create responsive layouts in canvas apps](create-responsive-layout.md) for more details regarding layouts. If the sample app you selected has phone and tablet as layout options, select a layout of your choice.

1. Open Preview mode by pressing F5 (or by selecting the play button near the upper-right corner).

	Each sample represents a different scenario with a variety of screens and other controls. If you opened the Cost Estimator sample, you can use the default app to perform these tasks:

	- Create an appointment for estimating the cost of installing a flooring product in a room of a particular size.
	- Capture details such as address and square footage, and calculate the price based on discounts and tax rates.
	- Filter a list of appointments to show those for which estimates have been created, for which estimates haven't been created, or all appointments.
	
1. When you finish exploring the app, close Preview mode by pressing Esc (or by clicking or tapping the close icon near the upper-right corner, under the title bar for Power Apps).

## Save the app
1. Near the upper-left corner, select **File** tab.

1. In the **Settings** page, review the default settings.

1. Near the left edge, click or tap **Save**. 

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you created a sample that uses fictitious data. For more help learning how to create an app, you can also automatically generate an app based on data in other sources such as Common Data Service, SharePoint, or Excel.
