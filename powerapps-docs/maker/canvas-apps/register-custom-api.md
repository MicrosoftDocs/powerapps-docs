# Custom connectors for canvas apps

Without writing any code, you can build workflows and canvas apps with [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps), [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com), and [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com). To help you integrate your data and business processes, these services offer [180+ connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/) - for Microsoft services and products, as well as other services, such as GitHub, Salesforce, and Twitter.

Sometimes though, you might want to call APIs, services, and systems that aren't available as pre-built connectors. To support more tailored scenarios, you can build *custom connectors* with their own triggers and actions. We have a complete set of basic and advanced tutorials for custom connectors on the Connectors documentation site. We recommend that you start with the [custom connector overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/), but you can also go straight to the following topics for details on a specific area:

* [Create a custom connector from an OpenAPI definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition)

* [Create a custom connector from a Postman collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/define-postman-collection)

* [Create a custom connector from scratch](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/define-blank)

* [Use a custom connector from a PowerApps app](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/use-custom-connector-powerapps)

* [Share custom connectors in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/share)

* [Submit your connectors for Microsoft certification](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification)

* [Custom connector FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/faq)
