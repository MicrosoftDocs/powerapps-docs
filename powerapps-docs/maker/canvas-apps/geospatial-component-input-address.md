# Use the address input control to easily enter addresses

Entering addresses can be frustrating and error-prone, particularly in mobile apps. Use the address input control to make address entry easier. The control uses fuzzy logic to suggest potential matches as you type. Select the one you want to quickly and easily enter an accurate address.

The control returns the address as structured data. Your app can extract information such as city, street, municipality, and even latitude and longitude coordinates. The data is in a format that's friendly to many locales and international address formats.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the control in your apps, you'll need to [enable geospatial features for the environment](geospatial-overview.md#enable-geospatial-features-for-the-environment). Make sure you also [review the prerequisites for using geospatial controls](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites-for-full-support). Refer to the [privacy and security table](geospatial-overview.md#privacy-and-security-considerations) for more details on the address input control's data usage.

## Add an address input control to your app

With your app open for [editing](./edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Input**.
1. Select **Address input** to place an address input box in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely. You must enter at least three characters including one number for the address input control.

## Set a default search radius

By default, the control will search around the user's location. You can refine the default search area to help narrow the initial results.

1. On the address input control's **Properties** tab, turn on the **Search within radius** property.
1. Enter a longitude, latitude, and radius in meters.

The control will start searching at the given latitude and longitude, out to the distance specified.

## Use the map control with the address input control

You can add a button to your app to save entered addresses as a data collection. Then you can retrieve the addresses and display them in [the map control](geospatial-component-map.md).

1. Add a map control and an address input control to your app.

1. Insert and place a **Button** control.

1. Change the **OnSelect** property of the button control as follows. (Hint: Copy the formula and paste it in the formula bar or on the **Advanced** properties tab, whichever you prefer.)

1. Enter a longitude, latitude, and radius (in meters).

    The control will start searching at the latitude and longitude, out to the distance specified in the radius field.


    ```powerapps-dot
    If(IsBlank(AddressInput1.SearchResultJson), "", Collect(locations, {Latitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLatitude, Longitude: AddressInput1.SelectedLongitude}))
    ```

    The formula saves the current latitude and longitude to a collection named *locations*, as long as the search results aren't blank.

1. Select the map control. Change its properties as follows:

    | Property name | Value | Where |
    | - | - | - |
    | Items | "Locations" | **Properties** tab |
    | ItemsLatitudes | "Latitude" | **Advanced** tab |
    | ItemsLongitudes | "Longitude" | **Advanced** tab |

When the user selects the button, the result from the address input control is added to the map as a new pin.
