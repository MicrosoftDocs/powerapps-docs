# Test whether an object will fit in a space using mixed reality

You can use the [Measure in MR](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md) control to determine whether an object of a known size will fit in a particular space. In this article, we'll create a canvas app to do just that.

> [!TIP]
> The mixed-reality (MR) controls work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. Tracking is better on LIDAR-enabled devices.

## Add minimum dimensions input fields to a canvas app

First, we’ll create a blank canvas app. Then we'll add a way for the user to enter the minimum dimensions to test against (that is, the smallest space that will hold the object we want to fit).

1. [Create a blank canvas app](./create-blank-app.md).

2. Select the **Insert** tab. Insert and place three **Text label** controls on the screen.

3. Change the **Text** property of the labels to **Minimum Width**, **Minimum Depth**, and **Minimum Height**, respectively.

4. Select the **Insert** tab. Insert three **Text Input** controls, and place them to the right of the three labels.

5. Rename the text input controls to **minWidth**, **minDepth**, and **minHeight**, respectively.

6. Select all three text input controls. Change the group's **Format** property to **Number** and set the **Default** property to **1.0**.

## Add and bind the **Measure in MR** control

Next, we’ll add the **Measure in MR** control to allow the user to measure a three-dimensional space. We'll bind the measurements to a data table for later use.

1. Select the **Insert** tab, and expand **Mixed Reality**.

2. Select **Measure in 3D** to place the control in the app screen. Drag the control near the bottom of the screen.

3. Change the control's properties as follows:

    | Property name | Value | Where |
    | - | - | - |
    | Unit of measurement | Feet or Meters | Select on the **Properties** tab |
    | Measurement type | Volume | Select on the **Properties** tab |
    | Box draw | On | Select on the **Properties** tab |
    | Items | **Table({label:"Test Volume"})** | Enter on the **Advanced** tab |
    | ItemsLabels | **"label"** | Enter on the **Advanced** tab |
    | OnMixedRealitySelect | **Set(testVolume, LookUp(MeasureInMR1.Measurements, Label = "Test Volume"));** | Enter on the **Advanced** tab |

The **Items**, **ItemsLabels**, and **OnMixedRealitySelect** properties of the **Measure in MR** control should look like the following examples when you're done:

:::image type="content" source="media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-advanced-properties-items.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a Measure in 3D control under construction in Microsoft Power Apps Studio, shown alongside its Items and ItemsLabels properties.":::

:::image type="content" source="media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-advanced-properties-onmixedrealityselect.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a Measure in 3D control under construction in Microsoft Power Apps Studio, shown alongside its OnMixedRealitySelect property.":::

The formula in **Items** captures the dimensions of the measured space in a data table named "Test Volume." The formula in **OnMixedRealitySelect** sets a variable named "testVolume" to the values captured in the "Test Volume" table.

## Display the results

Finally, we'll add text labels to display the measurements that were taken and the result of the test (that is, whether the object will fit in the measured space).

1. Select the **Insert** tab. Insert and place four **Text label** controls on the screen.

2. Change the **Text** property of the label controls as follows. (Hint: Copy each formula and paste it in the formula bar or on the **Advanced** properties tab, whichever you prefer.)

    - First label:

        ```powerapps-dot
            If(IsBlankOrError(testVolume), "No Measurement captured",
                If(testVolume.Height >= Value(minHeight.Text) &&
                ((testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Value(minWidth.Text) && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Value(minDepth.Text)) ||
                (testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Value(minDepth.Text) && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Value(minWidth.Text))),
                "Fit Test Succeeded", "Fit Test Failed"))
        ```

        This formula sets the label text according to whether the test succeeded or failed, based on the minimum dimensions required to hold the object we want to fit. If the test didn't run, either because no measurements were captured or an error occurred, the label text reflects that.

        :::image type="content" source="media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-output-label.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a text label control under construction in Microsoft Power Apps Studio, shown with its Text property in the formula bar and advanced properties tab.":::

    - Second label:

        ```powerapps-dot
            Concatenate("Bounding Width: ", Text(testVolume.BoundingWidth))
        ```

        This formula sets the label text to "Bounding Width:" followed by the width dimension of the measured space.

    - Third label:

        ```powerapps-dot
            Concatenate("Bounding Depth: ", Text(testVolume.BoundingDepth))
        ```

        This formula sets the label text to "Bounding Depth: " followed by the depth dimension of the measured space.

    - Fourth label:

        ```powerapps-dot
            Concatenate("Bounding Height: ", Text(testVolume.Height))
        ```

        This formula sets the label text to "Bounding Height: " followed by the height dimension of the measured space.

The app screen should now look like this:

## Test the app

Select the preview button to run the app in preview mode. Select **Measure in MR** to populate the labels with data. To verify that the label bindings are working, enter new values in the text input fields.

:::image type="content" source="media/augmented-measure-fit-test/fit-test-succeeded.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the app screen in preview mode after new minimum dimensions have been entered.":::

The values for **Bounding Width** and **Bounding Depth** can be swapped when you perform the test.

[Save and publish](save-publish-app.md) your app. Open it on a mixed-reality–enabled device to test whether an object with the specified dimensions will fit within the bounds of any measurement captured.

## Filtering a data source


The app we created tests a single set of dimensions that are specified by the user when the app runs. However, you can extend it to test against any data source by applying the formula as a **Filter** predicate.

For example, let's say that our app contains a reference to a Dataverse table named **Products** that includes three columns: **Width**, **Depth**, and **Height** (corresponding to each product's dimensions). To filter the collection to show only the measurements that would fit in a measured volume, we can apply the following formula.

```powerapps-dot
    If(IsBlankOrError(testVolume), Products,
    Filter(Products, testVolume.Height >= Height &&
        ((testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Width && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Depth) ||
        (testVolume.BoundingWidth >= Depth && testVolume.BoundingDepth >= Width))))
```
