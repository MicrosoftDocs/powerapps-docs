# Use the Measure in MR control to take measurements

Measure the distance, area, and volume of your physical space using your device camera.

To use the measurement feature, your app maker needs to enable the [Measure in MR](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md) control for your canvas app. Depending on how your app maker has configured the app, the type of measurements can vary as shown in the example below.

## Basic navigation

It's easy to get around and take measurements of your space. The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements.

Legend

1. **Camera**: Take a picture of your current view. The picture can be used by your
canvas app but isn't viewable when you're in a mixed reality experience.
1. **Undo**: Rewinds the last measurement action taken and returns to the state before the last add, reset, or delete.
1. **Add**: Select to start a new measurement or add a new measurement point. When you're done measuring the button changes to a checkmark button that you select to complete your measurement.
1. **Overview**: Opens a list with details of the items you have measured.
1. **Submit**: When you're done taking your measurement(s), use the Submit button to close the mixed reality experience and send the measurement(s) to your canvas app. The button is grayed out if there are no measurements or when you're in the process of taking measurements.
1. **Overview**: Opens a list with details of the items you have measured.
1. **Reset**: Clear all your measurements at once.
1. **Exit**: Leave the mixed reality experience and return to your canvas app.

## Take a measurement

1. Open your canvas app and select the **Measure in MR** button.

2. Follow the instructions on the screen by moving your device until it vibrates, and white dots appear. The white dot with a circle is the starting point of your measurement.

         > ![Add point to outline the base of the volume.](./media/mr-measurement/volume-add-points-15.png)

      1. Connect the last dot to the first dot to complete the measurement.

          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Continue taking volume measurements or submit the measurements.](./media/mr-measurement/area-submint-18.png)  

          > [!NOTE]
          > If your app has **Box Draw** enabled then you can only measure volume by a rectangular prism. To take this measurement select four points; three to draw the base and one for the height.<br><br>
            ![Measure four points.](./media/mr-measurement/measure-four-points.png)

          > ![Freeform measurement.](./media/mr-measurement/measure-freeform.png)  

       1. Keep the dot at the last point and tap the green checkmark to finish your current measurement. Continue taking other measurements, or if you are done, select **Submit** to return to your canvas app.

          > ![Continue taking freeform measurements or submit the measurements.](./media/mr-measurement/measure-form-submint.png)  

          The same rectangle can be part of a volume measurement. Instead of selecting the last point you added, rotate your phone upwards to select a height and then  tap the green checkmark. Continue taking other measurements, or if you are done, select **Submit** to return to your canvas app.

> If your app has **Box Draw** enabled, then in freeform you can only measure in a rectangular area and volume.
