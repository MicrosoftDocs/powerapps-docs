# View 3D content or images in the real word

You can use the **View in MR** component in your app to let users see how a particular item might fit within a specified space.

The component creates a button in your app. When app users click the button, it overlays a selected 3D model (in the .glb file format) or image (in .jpg or .png file formats) onto the live camera feed of the device.

You can also take photos and [upload them to OneDrive](mixed-reality-take-upload-photos.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your 3D content must be in the .glb file format.  
> You can [convert your existing 3D models into the .glb file format](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/3d-content-guidelines/) from a variety of 3D formats.


> [!TIP]
> The MR components work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. When establishing tracking, point the device at the surface you would like to track and slowly pan the device from right to left in broad arm motions. If tracking fails, exit and enter the MR view to reset the tracking and try again.  
>
> LIDAR-enabled devices will also result in better tracking.

> [!TIP]
> The MR components in Power Apps leverage Babylon and Babylon React Native. As a result of this shared MR platform, 3D content that works in the [Babylon sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) should work in Power Apps. 

## Use the component

Insert the component into your app as you normally would for any other button control or component.

With an app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Mixed reality**.
3. Select the component **View in MR** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

You can modify the component with several properties.

### Properties

The following properties are on the component's **View in MR** pane on the **Properties** and **Advanced** tabs.

![Properties on the View in MR pane.](./media/augmented-view-mr/augmented-view-mr-properties.png "Properties on the View in MR pane")

Some properties are only available under **More options** in the **Advanced** tab on the **View in MR** pane.

Property | Description | Type | Location

OnChange | Behavior that is triggered when any property on the button is changed. | Defined action | **Advanced**

### How object scaling is handled

When you insert a model with the **View in MR** component, it will follow the model's inherent dimensions. Alternatively, you can specify some or all of the dimensions - these dimensions are labelled as the **Object width**, **Object height**, and **Object depth** properties.

If you want to change the size of the model, we apply certain scaling techniques depending on how many dimensions you change:

- If no dimensions are set, we assume the model is already at its intended scale and leave it as is.  

- If one dimension is set, and the others are left at the default `0`, we scale the whole object equally based on the set dimension.  
  This behavior is similar to using a setting such as "keep aspect ratio" when resizing an image.  

- If two dimensions are set, we force the model to match the given dimensions and average the scale for the third dimension.  
  - For example, say you had a model with an **Object height** of `12`, an **Object width** of `6`, and an **Object depth** of `3`.  
  You set **Object height** to `24`, and **Object width** to `9`, but leave **Object depth** unchanged.  
  The height has increased by a factor of 2, but the width has increased by a factor of 1.5 - we average these two measurements to come to 1.75 and then scale the depth by that amount.  
  The final scaled model would have an **Object height** of `24`, **Object width** of `9`, and **Object depth** of `5.25`.  

- If all three dimensions are set, we match the size of the model to what you specify.

> [!NOTE]
> If the measurements don't adhere to the original aspect ratio, you could end up with a squashed or distorted model when you view it in MR.
