# View 3D content or images in the real word (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use the **View in MR** component in your app to let users see how a particular item might fit within a specified space.

The component creates a button in your app. When app users click the button, it overlays a selected 3D model (in the .glb file format) or image (in .jpg or .png file formats) onto the live camera feed of the device.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4vvwR]

You can also take photos and [upload them to OneDrive](mixed-reality-take-upload-photos.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your 3D content must be in the .glb file format.  
> You can [convert your existing 3D models into the .glb file format](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/) from a variety of 3D formats.

To use the component, you need to [enable the mixed reality (MR) features for each app](mixed-reality-overview.md#enable-the-mixed-reality-features-for-each-app) that you want to use it in.

Make sure to also [review the prerequisites for using MR components](mixed-reality-overview.md#prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> The MR components work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. When establishing tracking, point the device at the surface you would like to track and slowly pan the device from right to left in broad arm motions. If tracking fails, exit and enter the MR view to reset the tracking and try again.

## Use the component

Insert the component into your app as you normally would for any other button control or component.

With an app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Mixed reality**.
3. Select the component **View in MR** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

   ![Insert the View in MR component into the app](./media/augmented-view-mr/augmented-view-mr.png "Insert the View in MR component into the app")

You can modify the component with a number of properties.

### Properties

The following properties are on the component's **View in MR** pane on the **Properties** and **Advanced** tabs.

![Properties on the View in MR pane](./media/augmented-view-mr/augmented-view-mr-properties.png "Properties on the View in MR pane")

Some properties are only available under **More options** in the **Advanced** tab on the **View in MR** pane.

Property | Description | Type | Location

Text | Label for the button | String | Properties (also in **Advanced**)
Display type | Whether the button shows just an icon, text, or both. | Drop-down selection | Properties (also in **Advanced**)
Source | Data source that identifies the .glb file to display. The **View in MR** component supports loading models from:<br/><ul><li>Publicly accessible, CORS-compliant URLs.</li><li>Base64-encoded URIs.</li><li>Attachments or media content accessed through data connectors.</li></ul><br/>For more information, see [Define where the 3D content is stored](mixed-reality-component-view-3d.md#define-where-the-3d-content-is-stored) in the **View in 3D** component's topic. | Not applicable | **Properties** (also in **Advanced**)
Object width | Width of the displayed image or 3D content. | Integer | **Properties** (also in **Advanced**)
Object height | Height of the displayed image or 3D content. | Integer | **Properties** (also in **Advanced**)
