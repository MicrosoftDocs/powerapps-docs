# View 3D content or images in mixed reality

Use the **View in MR** control to place a 3D model of an object or an image in a real-world space. For instance, preview a painting on a wall before you hang it, or see whether a 3D virtual bookcase will fit where you intend it to go.

What if you don't have a 3D model of the object? Load an image of the object and set its dimensions to the object's size. The control applies the image as the face of a virtual cube of the desired size. Place this stand-in for the 3D model in your space.

The **View in MR** control adds a button to your app. When a user selects the button, the app overlays a selected 3D model (in .glb, .stl, or .obj file formats) or image (in .jpg or .png file formats) on the device camera feed.

:::image type="content" source="./media/augmented-overview/view-in-mixed-reality.png" alt-text="A photo of a tablet screen that shows a 3D model of a forklift overlaid on a warehouse interior view.":::

You can also take photos using the **View in MR** control and [upload them to OneDrive](mixed-reality-take-upload-photos.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your 3D content must be in the .glb, .stl, or .obj file formats.
> You can [convert your existing 3D models into the .glb file format](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/3d-content-guidelines/) from a variety of 3D formats.
> 3D content compressed with Draco compression Draco is not supported.

> [!TIP]
> - Make sure your 3D models are [optimized for use with Power Apps](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/3d-content-guidelines/optimize-models) to minimize load times.
>
> - The mixed-reality (MR) controls work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. Tracking is better on LIDAR-enabled devices.
>
> - The MR controls in Power Apps use Babylon and Babylon React Native. Mixed reality content that works in the [Babylon sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) should work in Power Apps through this shared MR platform. If your content works in Babylon but not in Power Apps, ask a question in the [Power Apps Community Forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Get-Help-with-Power-Apps/ct-p/PA_General). (Tag it with "mixed reality.")

## Add a View in MR button to an app screen

With your app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Mixed Reality**.

1. Select **View in MR** to place the control in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.

The control is a button that's labeled with an icon of a cube and the text *View in MR*. Change the label and hide the icon if you like in the **Text** and **Display type** properties.

## View different models in a single session

The View in MR control displays one media file by default. To view different media files selected through a media gallery during the MR experience, use the control's *Items* advanced property. This property creates a table that lists media files the user can choose from in the mixed reality experience.

When you use the *Items* property, you need to set a value for the following additional advanced properties to map the columns of your table:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ItemsSource** (required) | Specifies which column in *Items* identifies the 3D model or image to show in the mixed reality view. See [Connect 3D models to Power Apps](mixed-reality-component-view-3d-store.md) to learn more about bringing models into Power Apps. |
| **ItemsLabel** | Specifies which column in *Items* contains the label to show in the media gallery. The *Alternative text* property is used for items that don't have a label specified. |
| **ItemsThumbnail** | Specifies which column in *Items* identifies the thumbnail to show in the media gallery. A default thumbnail is provided for items that don't have one specified. |
| **ItemsObjectWidth, ItemsObjectHeight, ItemsObjectDepth** | Specifies an explicit size for each media item in the table. *Object width*, *Object height*, and *Object depth* are used for items that don't have a specific size.

To test it, let's create a media gallery that shows three different plants in a room setting. Our *Items* table looks like this:

| label | source | thumbnail |

| Small Palm Tree | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/palm_green.glb | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/palm_green.png |

:::image type="content" source="./media/augmented-3d/multi-model-selection-tray.gif" alt-text="Video that shows a media gallery in a mixed reality experience.":::

With your app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Mixed Reality**.

2. Select **View in MR** to place the control in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.

3. On the **Advanced** properties tab, select the *Items* property and type or paste the following code:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Table(
    {
    label: "Birds of Paradise",
    source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/bird_of_paradise_blue.glb",
    thumbnail: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/bird_of_paradise_blue.png"
    },
    {
    label: "Fiddle Leaf Fig",
    source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/flf_orange.glb",
    thumbnail: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/flf_orange.png"
    },
    {
    label: "Small Palm Tree",
    source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/palm_green.glb",
    thumbnail: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/palm_green.png"
    }
    )
    ```

4. Set the *ItemsLabel* property to `"label"`.

5. Set the *ItemsSource* property to `"source"`.

6. Set the *ItemsThumbnail* property to `"thumbnail"`.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/augmented-view-mr/source-list.png" alt-text="A screenshot of View in MR control properties.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The *Items* property is set to your data source which can be a collection, from a connector, or a hardcoded table like in this example. The *ItemsSource*, *ItemsLabel*, and *ItemsThumbnail* properties are set to the column names of that data source within quotation marks.

7. Save and publish the app, then open it on your mobile device to try it out.

## How objects are scaled if you resize them

If you don't specify dimensions when you place a model, the **View in MR** control follows the dimensions given in the object file. You can resize the model by entering a value other than 0 in one or more of the control's width, height, and depth properties (**Object width**, **Object height**, and **Object depth**). How the model is scaled depends on how many dimensions you change.

- If all dimensions are *0* (the default), the model's size is left as it's set in the object file.  

- If one dimension is set, the model is scaled equally based on the changed dimension, similar to setting "keep aspect ratio" when you resize an image.

- If two dimensions are set, the model scales to the two given dimensions and an average of the first two.  
  For example, say you have a model that is 12 m high, 6 m wide, and 3 m deep. You set the **View in MR** control's properties as follows: **Object height**: **24**, **Object width**: **9**, **Object depth**: **0** (unchanged). The height increases by a factor of 2, and the width increases by a factor of 1.5. The increase in height and width is averaged to find the factor by which the depth should be increased: 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. The final dimensions of the model are **Object height** 24, **Object width** 9, and **Object depth** 5.25 (3 x 1.75).  

- If all three dimensions are set, the model's size is changed to what you specified.

> [!NOTE]
> If the measurements don't adhere to the original aspect ratio, the model could be squashed or distorted when it's viewed in MR.
