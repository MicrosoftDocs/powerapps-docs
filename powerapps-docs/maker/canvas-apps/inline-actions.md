# Use inline actions in Power Apps Studio 

Use inline actions to update layouts, work with data, collaborate with your colleagues, and use Copilot directly on the canvas for specific controls. This means you can build and modify your app without navigating away from your current view in Power Apps Studio. This provides a more streamlined and efficient way to work.

## Use Copilot inline

Use Copilot inline to help you write Power Fx formulas. Use Copilot to apply conditional formatting, sort and filter your data, and more with the help of Power Apps Ideas. The Copilot button appears where applicable, offering suggestions for supported controls such as **Gallery**, **Data table**, **Text input**, **Drop down**, **Combo box**, and **Text label**. For more information, see [Power Apps Ideas](power-apps-ideas.md).

## Choose a layout

Use inline actions to select layout options for certain controls to create the look you want.

### Blank screen template

Use inline actions to apply a layout to blank screens. 

Add a blank screen, select **Templates** and then select a new layout. 

> [!NOTE]
> Once you add content to a screen, the **Templates** button won't be available.

### Gallery control (classic) layouts

Add a gallery control and then use the **Layout** button to change the layout for the control. Different layout options appear when you add  a **Vertical gallery** or **Horizontal gallery**.

When you add or remove controls after applying a layout, changing the layout removes your customizations.

### Form control (modern or classic) layouts

To access the **Layout** button on a modern or classic **Form** control, you must first link it to a data source. Once linked, the **Layout** button appears in the inline actions. You can then use the **Layout** option to select whether the labels and inputs are arranged vertically or horizontally.

- Select the **Vertical** layout to place the label above the corresponding input control.
- Select the **Horizontal** layout to place the label to the left of the input control.

## Add Data and Fields

Maintain your workflow using inline actions to bind data to a control and then add fields.

### Gallery, Table, and Form

 When you add a **Gallery**, **Table**, or **Form** control, the **Data** button is automatically selected. You can then add a data source to the control. Once the data source is added, the control displays the data.

 Use the **Fields** button to select which fields are shown on the control from the selected data source.

 In a **Table** control, you can drag and drop the fields to change the order that they appear in the table.

In a **Form** control, if you choose a new data source, you're prompted to replace the data card. When you confirm your selection, it removes any customizations and generates a new form with fields corresponding to the new data source.  

You can always access the **Data** and **Fields** buttons from inline actions to modify the information used in the **Form**, **Gallery**, or **Table**  control.

## Add comments

Comments allow you to tag peers in your app to ask questions, leave instructions, and propose next steps. You can add and read
comments on a screen and any control from inline actions.  

The following images show how the comment button looks when there's no comment and when a comment is added.

- Comment button when a comment is added: :::image type="content" source="media/inline-actions/comment-added.png" alt-text="Comment button when there's a comment":::

 When you select **Comments**, it opens the **Comments** pane where you can add and view comments.
