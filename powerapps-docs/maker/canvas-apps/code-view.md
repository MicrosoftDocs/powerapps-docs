# Use code view for canvas app controls 

Use the code view feature to look at the underlying code for each control on your app's screens. The code uses an improved format that's a subset of YAML.

With code view you can:

- View the code for each control on your screen.
- Copy the code for a control and share it outside of Power Apps Studio.
- Paste the code for a control and create a new control based on it.

## View, copy, and paste code

Code view shows the code for the selected control and all its child controls.

Code view lets you copy and paste code to any screen in your app, or outside of Power Apps, to duplicate the control. This duplication feature is helpful when controls are highly customized and you want to share or duplicate it.

### View code

1. Open your app for [editing](edit-app.md) in Power Apps Studio.

1. Right-click the control in the tree view or on the screen, and then select **View code**.

> [!TIP]
> Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+F` to find a specific string in the code.

### Copy and paste code

1. To copy the code of a selected control, you can:
   - Use the menu to copy.
   - Use the shortcut "ctrl + c"
   - When viewing your code in the code view popup, select **Copy code**.
1. To add a new control from the code:

   - Use the menu to paste.
   - Use the shortcut "ctrl + v"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must use the YAML format that Power Apps Studio generates. The code is validated before the new control is created.

## Known limitations

- You can't copy and paste or view the code for the **App Object**.
- You can't edit the code in the code view.
