# Common canvas apps performance issues and resolutions

You can build canvas apps with diverse options of data sources. Choose the right data source and a connector depending on the business needs and scenarios that the app is designed for. For enterprise apps, Microsoft Dataverse is the recommended data source since it comes with several performance benefits. For apps with small number of transactions, you can go with any other available data sources in your environment.

For performance considerations of an app, think about the number of users who will use the app when it has published, the volume of CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) transactions, type of data interactions, geographical access, and user’s devices.

In this article, you'll learn about some of the most common performance issues that can make canvas apps to run slowly, and how to resolve them. This information will help you to improve the app performance with your business plan and growth in mind.

We'll begin with some of the common performance issues, and resolutions regardless of the connector being used. In the later sections, you'll learn about performance issues and resolutions more specific to the referenced connectors.

Before you begin, ensure you [understand canvas apps execution phases and data call flow](execution-phases-data-flow.md). Also, [the possible sources of slow performance for canvas apps](slow-performance-sources.md) outline common pitfalls you can avoid while designing, or updating canvas apps.

## Large data sets loading slowly on different platforms

Performance of an app may vary when loading large sets of data on different platforms like iOS or Android. This variation happens because of different network request limitations on each platform.

For example, the number of concurrent network requests allowed may be different by platforms. This difference can have a major impact on the data load time for large data sets.

As a recommendation, restrict loading of the data to only what you need to display on the screen immediately. For other data, paginate, and [cache](performance-tips.md#cache-lookup-data) your data. You can also refer to the [performance tips and best practices](performance-tips.md) for additional ways to improve the app performance.

## Too many columns retrieved

It's recommended to select only the necessary columns for the app. Adding more, or all columns from the data source downloads all column data. This action results in a high number of network overhead calls, and therefore high memory usage in the client device. This problem can impact users with mobile devices even more if the network bandwidth is limited, or if a device has limited memory, or a legacy processor.

For example, if you use Microsoft Dataverse as the data source for your app, make sure you've enabled the [Explicit column selection](use-native-cds-connector.md) feature. This feature allows Power Apps to restrict the data retrieval for only the columns used in the app.

To turn the **Explicit Column Selection** feature on the canvas app, go to **File** -> **Settings** -> **Advanced Settings** -> Turn **Explicit column selection** feature *On*.

## Unsupported or legacy browsers

Users using unsupported, or legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer 11 may experience performance issues. Ensure the users only use the [supported browsers for running canvas apps](limits-and-config.md#supported-browsers-for-running-canvas-apps).

## Slow performance because of geographical distance

Geographical location of the Dataverse environment, and the proximity of the data source to the end-users impacts performance.

Having an environment close to users is recommended. Though Power Apps uses Content Delivery Network (CDN) for content, data calls still get the data from the data source. Data source located in another geographical location may adversely impact the performance of the app.

Geographical location distances impact performance in different forms, such as latency, reduced throughput, lower bandwidth, and packet loss.

## Allow list not configured

Ensure that you don't block the required service URLs, or add them to your firewall's allow list. For a complete list of all service URLs required to be allowed for Power Apps, go to [Required services](limits-and-config.md#required-services).

## Use of non-delgable functions and inappropriate data row limit for non-delegable queries

Delegable functions delegate the processing of data at the data source, minimizing the overhead at the client-side. When delegation is not possible, you can restrict the data row limit for non-delegable queries so that the number of rows returned from a server-based connection remain optimum.

Use of non-delegable functions, and inappropriate [data row limit for non-delegable queries](delegation-overview.md#non-delegable-limits) add extra overhead on data transfer. This overhead results in manipulation of the received data to [JS heap](#memory-pressure-at-the-client-side) at the client-side. Ensure to use delegable functions for the app whenever available, and the optimum data row limit for non-delegable queries.

More information: [Use delegation](performance-tips.md#use-delegation), [Delegation overview](delegation-overview.md).

## OnStart event needs tuning

The OnStart event runs when the application is loading. Calling large amounts of data using the functions in [OnStart property](functions/object-app.md#onstart-property) of the app will cause app to load slowly. A screen with heavy dependency of controls and values defined on another screen will be affected with slow screen navigation.

Some of the most common problems experienced in many such situations are:

### High number of calls in OnStart event causing app to start slowly

In an enterprise, volume of data calls to a central data source can drive server bottleneck, or resource contention.

Use [cache mechanism](performance-tips.md#cache-lookup-data), and optimize data calls. A single app may be used by many users, resulting in many data calls per user that reach at the server’s endpoints. These data calls can be a spot where the bottleneck, or throttling can happen.

### Latency on OnStart event because of heavy scripts

Heavy scripts at OnStart event are one of the most common mistakes while designing canvas apps. Makers should only get the necessary data required for the app to start.

Optimize formula in an OnStart event. For example, move some functions to [OnVisible](controls/control-screen.md#additional-properties) property instead. This way, you can let the app start fast, and other steps can continue while the app launches.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about OnStart optimization, you can also read [Optimize the OnStart property](performance-tips.md#optimize-the-onstart-property).

## Memory pressure at the client-side

A check on memory consumption of a canvas apps becomes important as most of the times, the app run on mobile devices. Memory exceptions in the heap are the most likely cause behind a canvas app that crashes or freezes (hangs) on certain devices.

JavaScript (JS) heap may hit the ceiling because of heavy scripts running at client side for adding columns, joining, filtering, sorting, or grouping.

In most cases, out-of-memory exception at the heap in client may trigger the app to crash, or hang.

Profile the app performance using a browser such as [developer tools for Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/). Check the scenarios that hit the ceiling of JS heap. More information: [Fixing memory problems using Microsoft Edge DevTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/memory-problems/)

When using data from the sources such as Microsoft Dataverse, or SQL Server, you can use a **View** object to ensure joining, filtering, grouping, or sorting occurs at the server-side instead of the client-side. This approach reduces client overhead of scripting for such actions.

If client-heavy operations like JOIN, or Group By happened at the client-side with a data set having 2000 records or more, the objects in the heap will increase resulting in hitting the ceiling.

Developer tools for most browsers allow you to profile memory. It would visualize heap size, document, nodes, and listeners.

## Performance considerations when using the SQL Server connector

You can use [SQL Server connector for Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/sql/) to connect to SQL Server on-premises, or Azure SQL Database.
In this section, you'll learn about the common performance-related problems and resolutions when using SQL Server as the connector for a canvas app. To learn more about using SQL Server on-premises, or Azure SQL Database with canvas apps, refer to [Connect to SQL Server from Power Apps](connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase.md), and [Create a canvas app from Azure SQL Database](app-from-azure-sql-database.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Though this section references SQL Server connector for performance issues and resolutions, most of the recommendations also apply when using any database type as the data source&mdash;such as MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

Let's take a look at the common performance problems and resolutions when using the SQL Server connector for canvas apps.

### N+1 query

Galleries generating too many requests to servers caused N+1 query problem. **N+1** query problem is one of the most commonly experienced problems when using the [gallery](add-gallery.md) control.

Use View objects in SQL backend to avoid the N+1 query problem. Or, change the UI (user interface) scenarios to avoid the problem.

### Table SCAN instead of Index SEEK

An app may slow down if the functions used by the app run queries in database resulting in table scans instead of index seek. More information: [Hints, Table SCAN, and Index SEEK](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-table)

To resolve such problems, use [StartsWith](functions/function-startswith.md) instead of [IN](functions/operators.md#in-and-exactin-operators) in formula. When using a SQL data source, the `StartWith` operator results in an index seek; but the `IN` operator results in an index or table scan.

### Slow queries

Profile and tune slow queries and indexes on the SQL database. For instance, if there's a formula getting certain data with descending (DESC) order on a certain column, that sorting column should have an index with descending order. Index key creates ascending (ASC) order by default.

You can also check the URL address of data requests. For example, the following data request snippet (partial OData call) asks SQL to return 500 records matching column to *Value* and order by *ID* in descending order.

`Items? \$filter=Column eq ‘Value’ & Orderby = ID desc & top 500`

This helps understand index requirements to cover such request conditions. In this example, the ID column should have an index with descending order to perform the query faster.

Check the execution plan of slow queries to see if any table or index scan exists. Monitor any excessive costs of Key Lookup in the execution plan. For more information, read [monitor and tune database for performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitor-and-tune-for-performance).

- [Use Extended Events to identify, or troubleshoot performance problems](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/extended-events/extended-events)

### Database resource contention

Ensure the data source&mdash;SQL database has no resource contentions such as processor bottleneck, I/O contention, memory pressure, or *tempDB* contention. Also check for Locks, Waits, Deadlock, and query timeouts.

> [!TIP]
> Use [automatic tuning](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning) for insights into potential query performance problems, recommended solutions, and to automatically fix the identified problems.

### Thick client or excessive requests

An app running Group By, Filter By, or JOIN operations at the client-side uses processor, and memory resources from the client devices. Depending on the data size, these operations may take more scripting time at the client-side, increasing the [JS heap](#memory-pressure-at-the-client-side) size on the client. When using on-premises data source, this problem increases since each lookup data call travels to the data source through the data gateway.

In such situations, use the **View** object in SQL database for Group By, Filter By, or JOIN operations. Views can use selective columns, and remove unnecessary columns with big data types such as NVARCHAR(MAX), VARCHAR(MAX), and VARBINARY(MAX).

> [!TIP]
> This approach also helps address the [N+1 query problem](#n1-query).

### Data size transferred to the client

By default, a canvas app shows data using the tables, or views from the available database objects. Retrieving all columns from a table may result in a slow response, especially when using big data types such as NVARCHAR(MAX).

Transferring large amounts of data to clients take time. This transfer also results in more scripting time with large amounts of data in the [JS heap](#memory-pressure-at-the-client-side) at the client-side.

To reduce data size transferred to the client, use Views with selective columns required for the app, and ensure [Explicit Column Selection](#too-many-columns-retrieved) is enabled.

### Considerations specific to SQL Server on-premises

Performance of a canvas apps using SQL Server connector with an on-premises data gateway may get affected in various ways. This section lists the common performance issues and resolutions specific to using an on-premises database source.

#### Unhealthy on-premises data gateway

Organizations can define multiple nodes for on-premises data gateways. Even if one of the nodes is unreachable, data requests onto the unhealthy node won't return the result within a decent time frame, or cause `unreachable` error messages after waiting for a while.

Ensure all on-premises data gateway nodes are healthy, and configured with a minimum network latency between the nodes and the SQL instance.

#### Location of on-premises data gateway

Data gateway requires network calls to on-premises data sources to interpret the OData requests. For instance, data gateway needs to understand the data entity schema to translate OData requests into SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements. Extra overhead is added when the data gateway is configured in a separate location with high network latency between the data gateway and the SQL instance.

In an enterprise environment, having a scalable data gateway cluster is recommended when heavy data requests are expected. Check how many connections are established between the data gateway nodes and the SQL instance.

By checking the concurrent connections in an on-premises data gateway or in a SQL server, your organization can decide the point when the data gateway needs to scale out, and with how many nodes.

#### Data gateway scalability

If you expect to access a large volume of data from the on-premises data gateway, just a single node of the on-premises data gateway can become a bottleneck to cover such large volume of requests.

A single node of the on-premises data gateway may be sufficient to deal with 200 or less concurrent connections. Furthermore, if all these concurrent connections are executing queries actively, other requests end up waiting for an available connection.

To ensure on-premises data gateway scales as per the volume of data and requests, [monitor and optimize on-premises data gateway performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-performance).

### Considerations specific to Azure SQL Database

Canvas apps can connect to Azure SQL Database using the SQL Server connector. A common performance problem can be introduced when using Azure SQL Database is the selection of an incorrect tier depending on the business requirement.

Azure SQL Database is available in different service tiers, with varied capabilities for matching different business requirements. For more information about tiers, go to [Azure SQL Database documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview).

With heavy data requests, the resources on the tier you select may get throttled once the threshold value is hit. Such throttling compromises the performance of the next set of queries.

Check the service tier of Azure SQL Database. Lower tier would have some limitations and constraints. From a performance perspective, CPU, IO throughput, and latency are important. Hence, check the performance of the SQL database periodically, and check if resource usage exceeds the threshold. For example, on-premises SQL Server normally sets the threshold of CPU usage to around 75%.

## Performance considerations when using the SharePoint connector

SharePoint connector can be used to create apps with data from SharePoint lists. You can also create canvas apps directly from the SharePoint list view. Let's take a look at the common performance problems and resolutions when using a SharePoint data source with canvas apps.

### Too many dynamic lookup columns

SharePoint supports various data types&mdash;including dynamic lookups such as *Person*, *Group*, and *Calculated*. If a SharePoint list defines too many dynamic columns, it takes more time to manipulate these dynamic columns within SharePoint before returning data to the client running the canvas app.

Don't overuse the dynamic lookup columns in SharePoint. This overuse may result in avoidable and extra overhead on the SharePoint side for manipulation of data. For example, you can use static column to keep email aliases, or names of the people instead.

### Picture column and Attachment

Size of an image, and attached file can attribute to a slow response while retrieving to the client.

Review your SharePoint list, and ensure only the necessary columns have been defined. The number of columns in the list affects performance of the data requests. This effect is because of the matched records, or the records up to the defined data row limits is retrieved, and transmitted back to client with all columns defined in the list&mdash;whether the app uses all of them, or not.

Enable the [Explicit column selection](#too-many-columns-retrieved) feature to only query the columns used by the app.

### Large lists

If you have a large list with hundreds of thousands of records, consider partitioning the list, or split the list into several lists based on parameters such as the categories, or date and time.

For instance, your data could be stored on different lists on a yearly, or monthly basis. Then, you can implement the app to let a user select a time window to retrieve the data within that range.

Within a controlled environment, the performance benchmark has proved that the
performance of OData requests against SharePoint lists is highly related to the number of columns in the list, and the number of rows being retrieved (limited by [data row limit for non-delegable queries](delegation-overview.md#changing-the-limit)). Lower number of columns, and lower data row limit setting can make a canvas app to perform better.

In the real-world though, apps are designed to meet certain business requirements. It may not be quick or simple to reduce the data row limit, or the number of columns in a SharePoint list. However, it's recommended to monitor the OData requests at the client side, and tune the data row limit for non-delegable queries and the number of columns in a SharePoint list.

## Performance considerations when using Microsoft Dataverse as the data source

When you use the [Common Data Service connector](connections/connection-common-data-service.md) to access a Microsoft Dataverse environment, data requests go to the environment instance directly—without passing through API management. More information: [Data call flow with Common Data Service connector](execution-phases-data-flow.md#data-call-flow-with-common-data-service-connector-for-microsoft-dataverse-environment)

> [!TIP]
> When using a custom entity in Dataverse, additional security configuration may be required for users to be able to view the records using canvas apps. More information: [Security concepts in Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/wp-security-cds), [Configure user security in Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/database-security), [Security roles, and privileges](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

Canvas app connected to Dataverse may perform slowly if it runs client-heavy scripting such as Filter By, or Join at the client-side instead of server-side.

Use [Dataverse views](../model-driven-apps/create-edit-views.md) when possible. A view with the required join or filter criteria helps reduce the overhead of using an entire table. For instance, if you need to join entities, and filter their data, you can [define a view](../model-driven-apps/create-edit-views.md#places-where-you-can-access-the-view-editor-to-create-or-edit-views) by joining them and define only the required columns. Then, use this view in your app that creates this overhead at the server-side for join/filter instead of the client-side. This method not only reduces the extra operations, but also data transmission. For information about editing filter and sort criteria, go to [Edit filter criteria](../model-driven-apps/edit-filter-criteria.md).

## Performance considerations when using the Excel connector

[Excel connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/excel/) provides connectivity from a canvas app to the data in a table inside an Excel file. This connector has limitations compared to other data sources&mdash;for example, limited [delegable](delegation-overview.md) functions&mdash;enabling the canvas app to load data from the table only up to [2000 records](#use-of-non-delgable-functions-and-inappropriate-data-row-limit-for-non-delegable-queries). To load more than 2000 records, partition your data in different data tables as additional data sources.

Let's take a look at the common performance problems when using Excel as the data source for canvas apps, and how to resolve such problems.

### Too many data tables and large data size

Slowness in the app can be experienced when it uses Excel file with too many data tables, or data tables having an immense size of data over several columns. Excel file isn't a relational database, or a data source that provides [delegable](delegation-overview.md) functions. Power Apps has to load data from the defined data tables first. And then, use functions such as Filter, Sort, JOIN, Group By, and Search.

Too many data tables, with high number of rows and columns affects app performance and the client-side overhead because each data table needs to be manipulated within the [JS heap](#memory-pressure-at-the-client-side). This effect also leads to the app consuming more client-side memory.

To ensure your app doesn't get affected by such behaviors, define only the necessary columns on the data table in an Excel file.

### Heavy transactions

Since Excel data source deals with spread sheets, it's not a relational database system. Any changes from an app are managed by Excel in the same way as a user changing data in an Excel file. If the app has high number of reads, but less CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations, it may perform well. However, if the app makes heavy transactions, it may adversely affect the performance of the app.

There's no specific threshold value for the number of transactions since it also relates to the data being manipulated. Several other aspects also impact the app performance, such as the network overhead, or the user's device.

If you have read-only data, you can import such data into the app locally instead of loading it from the data source. For enterprise apps, use data sources such as Dataverse, SQL Server, or SharePoint instead.

### File size

You can choose from a wide-range of [cloud storage](connections/cloud-storage-blob-connections.md) options with varying, or configurable storage capacity for the Excel file. However, a single large Excel file with all tables defined in one file adds an extra overhead for the app while downloading the file, and reading the data to load at the client-side.

Instead of using one large file, split the data into multiple Excel files with minimum data tables. And then, connect to the file only when required. This way, loading the data from the data table happens in fragments, reducing the overhead of many tables, or large data set.

### File location

Geographic location of the data source, and the proximity to the [client locations](slow-performance-sources.md#client-browsers-devices-and-locations) can result in a common performance bottleneck for the app, and induce network latency. This effect can get amplified with a mobile client having limited bandwidth for connectivity.

It's better to keep the file near your end users (or, most of the end users&mdash;for global audience) so that the file can be downloaded quickly.
