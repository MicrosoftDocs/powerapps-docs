# Use Power Automate pane (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

You can now create new flows, or add existing flows, and even edit existing flows using Power Automate pane within Power Apps Studio. You don't have to browse to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) to work with flows and then return to Power Apps Studio for app editing. In order to use this capability, you'll have to enable the **Power Automate pane** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> - This feature must be enabled on a per-app basis.
> - Flows that you create or edit, and save from inside Power Apps Studio are also visible and available in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
> - Saved changes to the flows using Power Apps Studio will remain intact even if you close Power Apps Studio without saving changes to the app.
> - Removing a flow from a canvas app doesn't delete the flow from [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

## Enable Power Automate pane

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature is being rolled out and depending on your region, it may not be available for your tenant yet.
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Power Automate pane needs to be enabled manually through the feature switch. To enable the feature:

1. Open a [new](data-platform-create-app.md) or an [existing](edit-app.md) app in Power Apps Studio.

1. Select **Settings** at the top.

1. Select **Upcoming features**.

1. Under the **Preview** tab, select **Enable Power Automate pane** to turn on this feature. You may be prompted to close and reopen your canvas app to see the change.

    Save the app and relaunch Power Apps Studio. The Power Automate pane now appears in Power Apps Studio.

   :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/power-automate-button.png" alt-text="A screenshot highlighting the Power Automate option in the left pane":::

## Create a new flow

To start with flows inside Power Apps Studio, select **Create new flow** in the Power Automate pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/create-new-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing Create your flow screen having several options to choose a flow template from.":::

This action opens the **Create your flow** modal dialog within Power Apps Studio. You can choose to create the flow from the available templates, or create a flow from scratch.

### Start with a template

Power Automate provides several flow templates that you can choose from by default. This section explains how to create a flow using such available templates from within Power Apps Studio.

1. From the list of available templates, select a template of your choice. For this example, we'll use **Click a button in Power Apps to send an email**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/selected-flow-template.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing Click a button in Power Apps to send an email template.":::

1. The next step shows the connections required to create a flow based on the  selected template. More information: [Connectors overview](connections-list.md)

   :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/connections.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing connections required by the flow.":::

1. (Optional) If you want, you can use **Edit in advanced mode** to update the connection, and customize the flow template. When done, select **Save** to save the flow. Skip the next step since this completes your flow creation process.

1. Select **Next** > **Create** to create the flow.

    The flow now appears in the list of flows inside the Power Automate pane, under the **In your app** section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/flow-in-your-app.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the flow added to your app.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > For more information about creating cloud flows from templates, see [Create a cloud flow from a template](/power-automate/get-started-logic-template).

### Create from blank

Instead of using the available templates, you can also create a flow from scratch, and customize the steps as per your requirement.

1. Select **Create from blank**.

1. Add and customize the flow with steps and actions, as shown in the below example.

    :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/customize-blank-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing example workflow.":::

1. When done, select **Save** from top-right corner of the screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > For more information about customizing and configuring cloud flows, see **How-to** articles starting from [Add multiple actions and advanced options to a cloud flow](/power-automate/multi-step-logic-flow).

## Add an existing flow

You may have access to the existing flows in the environment where you're creating your app. To add and use these flows in your app, select **Add flow**, and then choose the flow from the **Add a flow from this environment** section.

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/add-existing-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the option to add existing flows from the current environment.":::

> [!TIP]
> You can hover over the flow to see more details before adding to your app.

You must meet the following requirements to be able to add an existing flow to a canvas app:

- You must have access to the flow.
- If the canvas app is part of a solution, you'll only see the flows that are part of the same solution.
- Flows must have a Power Apps trigger.

After added, the flow will appear under **In your app** section inside the Power Automate pane.

## Reference a flow

To reference the added flow, update the formula bar for the control or component within Power Apps Studio with the flow details. For example, to reference a flow named "PowerAppsbutton" that triggers an email without accepting any input parameters, use the following formula on the button's **OnSelect** property:

```powerapps-dot
PowerAppsbutton.Run()
```

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/reference-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing flow added to OnSelect property of the button with the above formula.":::

This behavior is different from how the reference to a flow works within Power Apps Studio if the Power Automate pane is disabled.

When you add a flow with Power Automate pane disabled, you must choose a behavior property of the control or the component that you want to associate with the flow. Adding flow in this case clears any formula already associated with the chosen property (when the flow reference is added). This means that any existing formula would be removed, and you have to carefully make a copy of the existing formula before adding the flow in order to preserve it. You can then paste your copied formula back after the flow reference has been added.

For example, on a button's OnSelect property, adding the flow removes your existing formula, and you have to carefully make a copy of the existing formula before adding the flow. The following example shows the process with Power Automate pane disabled. In this case, the formula added for the button property is removed to reference the added flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/old-method.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing flow added to OnSelect property of the button that replaces existing formula for the button property." border="false":::

Whereas with the Power Automate pane enabled, any existing formula is preserved automatically (isn't removed). You can add the flow reference in the formula for a behavior property as per your requirement.

The following example shows the process with Power Automate pane enabled. When the flow is added, the existing formula for the button's OnSelect property is preserved, and the flow reference isn't added automatically.

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/new-method.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing flow added to OnSelect property of the button that doesn't get replaced after the flow addition." border="false":::

Now you can reference the flow through regular process of updating the formula for the control or component&mdash;as explained earlier.

## Edit an existing flow

You can now edit flows added to your app without leaving Power Apps Studio.

1. Under the **In your app** section of the Power Automate pane, select **..** (ellipsis) to the right of a flow.

1. Select **Edit**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/edit-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the option to edit an existing flow.":::

    Flow opens inside the editor.

    :::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/edit-flow-editor.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the flow open in editor for customization.":::

1. Make your changes, and then select **Save**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To avoid losing unsaved changes, ensure you select **Save** before closing the editor.

## Refresh a flow

If any changes are made to the flow in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) (instead of using Power Apps Studio) while you're editing the app, you'll need to refresh your flow to get the latest changes.

To refresh the flow and pull the latest changes, select **...** (ellipsis) to the right of your flow, and then, select **Refresh**.

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/refresh-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the option to refresh the flow and pull in the latest changes.":::

A loading spinner will appear, and the flow will be refreshed.

## Remove a flow

To remove a flow from your app, select **...** (ellipsis) to the right of your flow, and then, select **Remove from app**.

:::image type="content" source="media/working-with-flows/remove-flow.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the option to remove the flow from the app.":::

This action only removes flow from the app, while the flow remains intact in the environment. You can add the flow again to the same app, or use in other apps.
