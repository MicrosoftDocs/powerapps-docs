> [!NOTE]
> This sample app includes locally saved information using [collections](create-update-collection.md). To use the app for business purpose, customize the app to store information using [connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors).

## How do I build the app myself?

Expense Report sample app includes the functionality commonly used in Power Apps. You can extend the app functionality by using connectors and connect the app to a data source instead of the default [collections](create-update-collection.md) used by the sample app.

[Save](save-publish-app.md#save-changes-to-an-app) the app, and update the app to use data source such as [SharePoint](connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md), or [Microsoft Dataverse](connections/connection-common-data-service.md).

You can also enable the capability to send emails or approval routing using [Power Automate flow](using-logic-flows.md) or [Approvals connector](/connectors/approvals).
