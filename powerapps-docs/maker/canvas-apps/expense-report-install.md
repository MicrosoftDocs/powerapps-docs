# Set up and explore the Expense Report sample template in Power Apps

In Power Apps, the Expense Report sample template is a tool for helping you track expense reports from submission to approval. By running the app, you can tally line items as individual expenses accrue and submit them for approval when youâ€™re ready. This app requires a small amount of setup to make it your own.

## Where can I run the app?

You can run this sample app in your browser, on a tablet, or on another device that has a similar form factor.

## How do I open the template and run the app?

The Expense Report sample app is available in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Follow these steps to open and run the sample app:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. On the left pane, select **Create**.

1. On the right side of the screen, scroll down to the **Start from template** section.

1. Enter a name.

1. Select **Create**.

1. When prompted, select **Allow** to let the app use the connections.

1. Press **F5** on the keyboard or use ![Preview button](./media/expense-report-install/preview.png "Preview button") to play the app.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample app includes locally saved information using [collections](create-update-collection.md). To use the app for business purposes, customize the app to store information using [connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors).

## How do I build the app myself?

The Expense Report sample app includes a lot of the functionality commonly used in Power Apps. You can extend the app functionality by using connectors to connect the app to a data source instead of the default [collections](create-update-collection.md) used by the sample app.

[Save the app](save-publish-app.md#save-changes-to-an-app) and update it to use a data source such as [SharePoint](connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md) or [Microsoft Dataverse](connections/connection-common-data-service.md).

You can also enable the capability to send emails or approval routing using [Power Automate flow](using-logic-flows.md) or [Approvals connector](/connectors/approvals).

Additionally, you can also read [Microsoft Learn: Create an expense report app from start to finish in Power Apps](/learn/paths/expense-canvas-app-start-finish/) to create a custom expense report app.
