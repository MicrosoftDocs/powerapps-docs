# Publish the Power BI project report and create a dashboard
> [!NOTE]
> This article is part of a tutorial series on using Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI with SharePoint Online. Make sure you read the [series introduction](sharepoint-scenario-intro.md) to get a sense of the big picture, as well as related downloads.

In this task, we'll publish our dataset and report to the Power BI service; then we'll create a dashboard based on the report. In many cases a report has a large number of visualizations and only a subset are used in a dashboard. In our case, we'll add all four visualizations to the dashboard.

## Step 1: Publish the dataset and report
1. In Power BI Desktop, on the **Home** tab, click or tap **Publish**.
   
    ![Publish dataset and report](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-01-publish.png)
2. If you're not already signed in to the Power BI service, enter an account, then click or tap **Sign in**.
   
    ![Sign in to account](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-02-account.png)
3. Enter a password, then click or tap **Sign in**.
   
    ![Enter account password](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-03-password.png)
4. Choose a destination for the report, then click or tap **Select**. We recommend publishing to a group workspace to simplify access to the report in SharePoint. In this case, we are publishing to the **Project Management** group workspace. For more information, see [Collaborate in your Power BI app workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace).
   
    ![Destination workspace](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-04-workspace.png)
5. After publishing completes, click or tap **Open 'project-analysis.pbx' in Power BI**.
   
    ![Publishing success](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-05-open-report.png)
6. The Power BI service loads the report in a browser. If the left navigation pane isn't expanded, click or tap the menu at the top left **(a)** to expand it.
   
    ![Report in Power BI service](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-06-service-report.png)
   
    You can see that when we published, Power BI Desktop uploaded a dataset **(d)** and a report **(c)**. You create dashboards in the service, not Power BI Desktop, and this workspace doesn't have any dashboards yet **(b)**. We'll create one shortly.

## Step 2: Configure credentials for refresh
1. In the service, click or tap ![Gear icon](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/icon-gear.png) in the top right corner, then click or tap **Settings**.
2. Click or tap **Datasets**, then **project-analysis**.
   
    ![project-analysis dataset](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-07-dataset.png)
3. Expand **Data source credentials**, then click or tap **Edit credentials**.
   
    ![Edit data source credentials](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-08-credentials.png)
4. Select **OAuth2** for Authentication method, then click or tap **Sign in**.
   
    ![Sign in to SharePoint](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-09-sign-in.png)
5. Select or sign in to an account that has permissions for the SharePoint lists.
   
    ![Signed into Office 365](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-10-account.png)
   
    When the process completes, you'll get the following message in the service.
   
    ![Data source updated](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-11-updated.png)

## Step 3: Create a dashboard

1. To get back to your report, under **REPORTS** click or tap **project-analysis**.

1. Click or tap the chart on the upper left, then click or tap ![Pin icon](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/icon-pin.png).
   
    ![Pin chart](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-12-pin-projected.png)
2. Enter a name for the dashboard you want to pin to, then click or tap **Pin**.
   
    ![Pin chart to new dashboard](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-13-pin-new.png)
3. Click or tap the chart on the upper right, then click or tap tap ![Pin icon](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/icon-pin.png).
   
    ![Pin chart](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-14-pin-variance.png)
4. Select the existing dashboard, then click or tap **Pin**.
   
    ![Pin chart to existing dashboard](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-15-pin-existing.png)

5. Repeat the pinning process for the other two visuals.

6. In the left navigation pane, click or tap the dashboard name.
   
    ![New dashboard in site navigation](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-16-dashboard-menu.png)

7. Review the dashboard. If you click on a tile, you will go back to the report.
   
    ![Completed dashboard](./media/sharepoint-scenario-publish-report/06-01-17-dashboard-completed.png)

That wraps up most of the work in Power BI. If that was your first experience creating reports and dashboards, congratulations! If you're already a pro, we hope you could move through it quickly. Now we will add alerting to make sure we know if the dashboard needs our attention.

## Next steps
The next step in this tutorial series is to [set up data alerts for the Power BI project report](sharepoint-scenario-alerts-flow.md).
