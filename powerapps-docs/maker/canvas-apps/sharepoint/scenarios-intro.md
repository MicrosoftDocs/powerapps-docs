# Scenarios for integrating SharePoint with Power Apps

You can connect a canvas app with sites from SharePoint Online, or on-premises SharePoint farms using the on-premises data gateway. Create different connections for different lists or libraries from the SharePoint sites.

In this section, you'll learn about common scenarios when working with an app that connects to SharePoint.

## Getting started with scenarios

Articles in this section explain individual and short scenarios when working with SharePoint integration with canvas app.

- [Filter a search list in an app](scenarios-filter-search-list.md)
- [Use drop-down lists with choices from lookup columns in a SharePoint list](scenarios-choice-to-lookup.md)
- [Customize an app screen based on column status inside a SharePoint list](scenarios-customize-view-based-on-column-status.md)
- [Work with permissions in a lookup list from a SharePoint site](scenarios-lookup-list-permissions.md)
- [Create SharePoint integrated canvas apps from scratch to view, edit, add, and delete SharePoint list items](scenarios-sharepoint-form-from-scratch.md)
