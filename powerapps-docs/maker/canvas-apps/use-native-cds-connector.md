# Common Data Service and the improved data source experience

## Overview

If you created a canvas app with a Common Data Service connector before November 2019, then you might not have the benefit of the most current version of the Common Data Service. 

The **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** option has following benefits:

1. Significant speed gains.
2. Increased reliability.
3. Access to Common Data Service **views** and **File and Image field attributes**.

The **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** option appears in the Advanced settings section:

![Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views](media/use-native-cds-connector/improved-data-source-setting.png)

The **Relational data, option sets, and other new features for Common Data Service** now appears in the Deprecated features section.

## How do I upgrade?

Upgrade your app by inspecting the settings of the features and then by following the directions below:

### *Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views* is On:

Either you already converted your canvas app to use this feature, or you started an app with default setting of *On* for this feature. No further actions required. 

You may also want to enable the **Explicit Column Selection** feature:

![Explicit column selection](media/use-native-cds-connector/explicit-column-selection.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** is not supported on [Power Apps for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-apps/9nblggh5z8f3). You must turn this feature *Off* when using Power Apps for Windows.

### *Relational data, option sets and other new features for Common Data Service* is Off:

Check *Deprecated features* section under *Advanced settings*.  If set to *Off*, continue with the following instructions as a first step in the conversion. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't see **Relational data, option sets and other new features for Common Data Service** in *Advanced settings*, or if it’s already *On*, skip the following steps and continue to the [next section](#improve-data-source-experience-and-common-data-service-views-is-off).

- **Step 1**: Turn **Use display names** feature **On**:
    
    1. Turn **Use display names** feature *On*.
    1. Wait for the health monitor to finish analyzing your app.
    1. Save, close, and reopen your app.
    1. Resolve all formula errors.
    1. Save, close, and reopen your app.
    
    *Possible errors and suggestions*:
    
    It’s possible that some of the newly shown display names may conflict with the display names for other entities, fields, or controls. For example, you may have a control and a field with the same name. You can change the name of the control with a unique value to fix.
    
    For any field and entity display name conflict, you may see a formula that expects an entity but resolves to a locally scoped field name.

    Use the square bracket with an **@** symbol to indicate a global scope so it resolves to the entity; for example, **[@entityName]**.
    
    
- **Step 2**: Turn **Relational data, option sets and other new features for Common Data Service** and **Use GUID data types instead of strings** features **On**:
    
    1. Turn **Relational data, option sets and other new features for Common Data Service** feature *On*.
    1. Turn **Use GUID data types instead of strings** feature *On*.
    1. Wait for the health monitor to finish analyzing your app.
    1. Resolve all formula errors.
    1. Save, close, and reopen your app.  
    
    *Possible errors and suggestions*:
    
    It’s possible to have errors at this stage if you're using an option set field or hard-coded GUID text values.  <br><br> 
    
    - *Option Set values*: If you're using an option set field with a text identifier for the option set value, use the dot notation instead to reference the option set value. For example, change `Patch(Accounts, OptionSet1 = “12345”)` to `Patch(Accounts, OptionSet.Item1)` where `Item1` corresponds to the `12345` value. <br>
    See the [Detailed Examples](#detailed-examples) section for more information.
    - *GUIDs*: If you're using a static GUID string such as `015e45e1044e49f388115be07f2ee116`, convert it to a function that returns a GUID object; for example `GUID(“015e45e1044e49f388115be07f2ee116”)`. 
    - *Lookups*: If you're using Lookup functions to get first-level lookup values such as `Lookup(Contacts, ‘contactID’ = ThisItem.ContactID”)`, consider using `ThisItem.PrimaryContacts` (where PrimaryContacts is the name of the entity) instead.

### *Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views* is Off:

Use the following instruction to turn **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** feature *On*:

1. Remove your existing Common Data Service data source connections. 
1. Turn *On* the **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** feature.
1. Add the Common Data Service connection using the new data source selection experience.
1. Save your application.

> [!NOTE]
> If your application is extremely large, adding your data source connections back may take a while. Don't close the application during this process.

## Converting canvas apps with the Dynamics 365 connector

To convert your app that uses the Dynamics 365 connector, you'll need to remove and add the connections to your data sources. Use the steps below to convert your connections to your data sources.

1. Ensure the **Improve data source experience and Common Data Service views** feature is turned *On*.
2. Remove your existing Dynamics 365 data source connections.
3. Add the connections to your data sources to the Common Data Service using the new data source selection experience. 

    > [!NOTE] 
    > If you have connections to other environments (other than current), select the *Entity* category and then the *More* (...) option to change the environment. You can then select an entity from a different environment to add to your application. Cross-tenant connections don't work with the improved native connector. You'll need to use data integration to access data cross-tenant.
4.	Save your application.

*Possible errors and suggestions*:

It’s possible to have errors as you convert if: you aren't using Display Names, if you are using GUID strings, or if you are using an option set field.

- If control name conflicts, change the name of the control to be different and unique. 
- For field and entity display name conflicts, you may see a formula that is expecting an entity but is resolving to a more locally scoped field name. Use the square bracket with an *@* symbol to indicate a global scope so it resolves to the entity; for example, **[@entityName]**.
- *Option Set values*: If you are using an option set field with a text identifier for the option set value, use the dot notation instead to reference the option set value. For example, change `Patch(Accounts, OptionSet1 = “12345”)` to `Patch(Accounts, OptionSet.Item1)` where `Item1` corresponds to the `12345` value. <br>
See the [Detailed Examples](#detailed-examples) section for more information.
- *GUIDs*: If you are using a static GUID string such as `015e45e1044e49f388115be07f2ee116`, convert it to a function that returns a GUID object; for example `GUID(“015e45e1044e49f388115be07f2ee116”)`. 
- *Lookups*: If you are using Lookup functions to get first-level lookup values such as `Lookup(Contacts, ‘contactID’ = ThisItem.ContactID”)`, consider using `ThisItem.PrimaryContacts` (where PrimaryContacts is the name of the entity) instead.
- For any Polymorphic references, refer to the Detailed Examples section below. 

## Detailed Examples

Converting your app to use the new **Option sets** and **Two options** data types with supporting controls can be challenging while upgrading an app to use the new *Improved data source experience and Common Data Service views* feature.

### Option Sets

Separate `_myfield` and `_myfield_label` fields were used for an Option set earlier. Now, there is a single `myfield` that can be used both for locale-independent comparisons and to obtain the locale-specific label.

#### Removing and adding Option set Data cards

It's recommended to remove existing data cards and add them back to work with your Option set. For example, if you are working with the Account entity and the Category Option set, you'll see that the *DataField* property of the data card was set to `_accountcategorycode_label`. In the field list you can see that the data card has a type of *String*:

![OptionSet with old style name](./media/use-native-cds-connector/OptionSet-with-old-style-name.png)

With the new *Improved data source experience and Common Data Service views* feature, you no longer see `_accountcategorycode_label`. It's replaced by `accountcategorycode`. Your card is now be marked as **custom** and you'll see errors. Remove the old data card and add the *Option Set* back. The new data card is *Option Set* aware.

![OptionSet with old style name](./media/use-native-cds-connector/OptionSet-with-new-style-name.png)

#### Editing the Option Set Filter expressions to use new syntax

Previously, if you wanted to use an Option Set value in a Filter expression you would need to use the *Value* field. For example:

```powerapps-dot
Filter(Account,'Category Value' = "1")
```

You'll need to edit this formula. Option set text identifer is no longer used for the value. This expression should be updated to look the following:

```powerapps-dot
Filter(Account, Category= ‘Category (Accounts)’.’Preferred Customer’)
```

'Category(Accounts)' is the name of enum used in the Category field of the Accounts entity. This is a local option set.  You can read more about local and global option sets here: [Global option sets.](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/create-edit-global-option-sets)

#### Editing Option Set Patch statements to use new syntax

Following is an example of earlier Patch statement for Option Set:

```powerapps-dot
Patch( Accounts, First(Accounts), { ‘Category Value’: 1 } ) )
```

You'll need to update your statements to follow this form:

```powerapps-dot
Patch( Accounts, First(Accounts), { Category: ‘Category (Accounts)’.’Preferred Customer’ } )
```

#### Option Set disambiguation

If the display name of an Option set **field** and the name of the Option set are the same, you'll need to disambiguate the formula. To continue using the Accounts Category Code example, the **@** implies to use the Option Set, not the field.

```powerapps-dot
Filter(Accounts, 'Category Code' = [@’Category Code’].'Preferred Customer')
```

### Two Options

#### Removing and adding Two Option set Data cards

You should remove existing data cards and add them back to work with your Two Option set. The data types were earlier recognized as simple boolean - such as true/on and false/off with no labels:

![Two Option Set - old style](./media/use-native-cds-connector/TwoOptionSet-Old.png)

With the new *Improved data source experience and Common Data Service views* feature, your card will now be marked as **custom** and you'll see errors.  Remove the old data card and add the Option Set back. You'll see an edit control with two options by default after you add.

![TwoOptionSet-New](./media/use-native-cds-connector/TwoOptionSet-New.png)

If you prefer the toggle switch for your boolean field, you can unlock the data card and replace the control in the data card with a toggle instead.  You'll also need to set these properties on the Toggle.

```powerapps-dot
Toggle1.Default = ThisItem.’Do not allow Bulk Emails’
Toggle1.TrueText = ‘Do not allow Bulk Emails (Accounts)’.’Do Not Allow’
Toggle1.FalseText = ‘Do not allow Bulk Emails (Accounts)’.Allow
DataCard.Value = If( Toggle1.Value,
    ‘Do not allow Bulk Emails (Accounts)’.’Do Not Allow’,
    ‘Do not allow Bulk Emails (Accounts)’.Allow )
```

![Two option Toggle switch](./media/use-native-cds-connector/TwoOption-Toggle.png)

#### Refining Two Option Patch statements

Using the [Patch](./functions/function-patch.md) function with Two option should work 'as is'. It supports direct use of true and false, similar to Boolean. The only difference is being if you had put the value in a Label control earlier that showed true and false, it will now show the Two option labels instead.

### Polymorphic lookups

Following guidelines help to upgrade your application if it referenced [polymorphic](working-with-references.md) fields. Polymorphic lookups, from the same field, support references to a restricted set of multiple entities.  Similar to references in other languages, a record reference is a pointer to a specific record in a specific entity. A record reference carries with it the entity information allowing it to point to a record in several different other entities, which differs from a normal lookup that can only point to records in one entity.  

#### Access, Set, and Filter on the Owner field of a record

For instance, the Owner field in an entity can refer to a record in the Users entity or the Teams entity. The same lookup field in different records could refer to records in different entities.
 
![Polymorphic Owner field](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Polymorphic1.png)
 
##### Polymorphic with Filter and Patch

Record references can be used just like a full record:

```powerapps-dot
Filter( Accounts, Owner = First( Teams ) )
Patch( Accounts, First( Accounts ), { Owner: First( Users ) })
```

##### Polymorphic with a Gallery displaying Owner name

Since a reference can point to different entities, you must be specific. You can't use **ThisItem.Owner.Name**, as the name field in the **Team** entity is **Team Name**, and the name field in the **User** entity is **Full Name**. Power Apps won’t know which type of lookup you're referring to, until you run the app.

To fix this issue: 

1. Add the data sources for the entity types that Owner could be; in current example, Users and Teams).
2. Use additional functions to make your intent clear.

There are two new functions you can make use of:

- IsType – Checks if a record reference is of a particular entity type.
- AsType – Casts a record reference to a particular entity type.

With these functions, you can write a formula that displays the name of the Owner taken from two differently named fields, based on the entity type of the Owner:

```powerapps-dot
If( IsType( ThisItem.Owner,  [@Teams]), 
    AsType( ThisItem.Owner, [@Teams]).'Team Name', 
    AsType( ThisItem.Owner, [@Users]).'Full Name' )
```

![Gallery with As Type](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Polymorphic-And-AsType-in-Gallery.png)

Global disambiguation operator for `[@Teams]` and `[@Users]` is used to ensure that you reference the global entity type. Though in this case it's not necessary, it's a recommended to always be clear. One-to-many relationships often conflict in the gallery's record scope, and this practice avoids that confusion.
 
#### Access and set the Company Name field (a Customer data type) of the Contacts entity

Customer lookup field is another polymorphic lookup that's similar to Owner. You can only have one Owner field per entity. But an entity can include zero, one, or more Customer lookup fields. The Contacts system entity includes the Company Name field, which is a Customer lookup field. Read [show the fields of a customer](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-references#show-the-fields-of-a-customer) for more details.
 
#### Access and set the Regarding field of activity entities such as Faxes, Phone Calls, Email Messages

Polymorphic lookups aren't limited to Accounts and Contacts. The list of entities is extensible with custom entities. For example, the Faxes entity has a polymorphic Regarding lookup field, which can refer to Accounts, Contacts, and other entities. If you have a gallery with data source set to Faxes, you can use the following formula to display the name associated with the Regarding lookup field. 
 
 ```powerapps-dot
If( IsBlank( ThisItem.Regarding ), "",
    IsType( ThisItem.Regarding, [@Accounts] ),
        "Account: " & AsType( ThisItem.Regarding, [@Accounts] ).'Account Name',
    IsType( ThisItem.Regarding, [@Contacts] ),
        "Contacts: " & AsType( ThisItem.Regarding, [@Contacts] ).'Full Name',
    "" )
```

![Gallery with Regarding](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Polymorphic-With-Regarding.png)
 
Read [Regarding lookup fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-references#understand-regarding-lookup-fields) and [Regarding relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-references#understand-regarding-relationships) for more details.

#### Access the list of all Activities for a record

In Common Data Service, entities such as Faxes, Tasks, Emails, Notes, Phone Calls, Letters, and Chats are designated as [activities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/activity-entities). You can also create your own [custom activity entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/custom-activities).

You can show activities of a specific type (such as Faxes or Taxes), or all activities associated with an entity such as account. Add the Activities entity and other individual entities whose data you plan to display in the canvas app.

Each time you add a record to (for example the Tasks entity), a record in the Activity entity with the fields common across all activity entities is created. Read [activity entity](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-references#activity-entity) for more details.

The following example shows that as you select an Account, all the Activities associated with that account will be displayed:
 
![Polymorphic Activities](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Polymorphic-Activities.png) 
 
The records are being displayed from the Activity entity. But you can still use the [IsType](./functions/function-astype-istype.md) function to identify which kind of activity they are. Again, before you use IsType with an entity type, you must add the necessary data source.
 
By using this formula, you can show the record type in a label control within the gallery:

 ```powerapps-dot
If( IsType( ThisItem, [@Faxes] ), "Fax",
    IsType( ThisItem, [@'Phone Calls'] ), "Phone Call",
    IsType( ThisItem, [@'Email Messages'] ), "Email Message",
    IsType( ThisItem, [@Chats] ), "Chat",
    "Unknown")
```

 ![Polymorphic-IsType](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Polymorphic-IsType.png)

#### Access the list of Notes for a record

When you create an entity, you can enable attachments. If you select the check box for enabling attachments, you'll create a Regarding relationship with the Notes entity, as this graphic shows for the Accounts entity:

![Notes-Field](./media/use-native-cds-connector/Notes-Field.png)

##### Filtering

You can't read or filter based on the Regarding field. However, the reverse Notes one-to-many relationship is available. To list all the Notes associated to an Account entity, you can use the following formula:

```powerapps-dot
First( Accounts ).Notes
```

##### Patch

You can't set the Notes field on an entity by using Patch. To add a record to an entity's Notes table, you can use the Relate function. Create the note first, as in this example:

```powerapps-dot
Relate( ThisItem.Notes, Patch( Notes, Defaults( Notes ), { Title: "A new note", isdocument:'Is Document (Notes)'.No } ) )
```
