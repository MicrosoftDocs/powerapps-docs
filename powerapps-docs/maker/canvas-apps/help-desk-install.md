# Set up and explore the Help Desk sample template in Power Apps

In Power Apps, the Help Desk sample template is a tool thatÂ provides a user-friendly experience to connect end users with support professionals. By running the app, you can quickly find answers to the most important questions, track progress of open tickets, and review details of previous requests. This app requires a small amount of setup to make it your own.

## Where can I run the app?

You can run this sample app in your browser, on a tablet, or on another device that has a similar form factor.

## How do I open the template and run the app?

The Help Desk sample app is available in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Follow these steps to open and run the sample app:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. On the left pane, select **Create**.

1. On the right side of the screen, scroll down to the **Start from template** section.

1. Select **Help Desk** from the available sample app templates.

1. Enter a name.

1. Select **Create**.

1. When prompted, select **Allow** to let the app use the connections.

1. Press **F5** on the keyboard or use ![Preview button](./media/help-desk-install/preview.png "Preview button") to [preview the app](preview-app.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This sample app includes locally saved information using [collections](create-update-collection.md). To use the app for business purposes, customize the app to store information using [connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors).

## How do I build the app myself?

The Help Desk sample app includes a lot of the functionality commonly used in Power Apps. You can extend the app functionality by using connectors to connect the app to a data source instead of the default [collections](create-update-collection.md) used by the sample app.

[Save the app](save-publish-app.md) and update it to use a data source such as [SharePoint](connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md) or [Microsoft Dataverse](connections/connection-common-data-service.md).

You can also enable the capability to send emails or approval routing using [Power Automate pane](working-with-flows.md) or [Approvals connector](/connectors/approvals).
