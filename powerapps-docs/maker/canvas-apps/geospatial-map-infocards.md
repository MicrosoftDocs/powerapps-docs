# Add informational cards to pins on a map


Easily add cards to maps in your canvas apps to show details about pinned locations. When a user selects a pin, a card pops up with information from the [data source you bound to the map control](./geospatial-map-excel.md). Any column in the data source (for example, an Excel table) can be shown as a field on the card.

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a canvas app](./create-blank-app.md) and make sure it meets the [geospatial prerequisites](./geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites-for-full-support).
1. [Insert a map](./geospatial-component-map.md).


## Add info cards to pins

1. [Bind the map to a data source](./geospatial-map-excel.md).
1. In the map control's **Properties** pane, select **Show info cards**. Select **On click** to show the info card when the user selects a pin, or **On hover** if it should appear when the user hovers over the pin.

1. In the **Properties** pane, next to **Fields**, select **Edit**.
1. Select **Add field**, and then select the fields from the data source that you want to show in the card. Select **Add**.

When the user selects a pin, an info card shows the fields you selected.

## Other interactive map features

- [Use data from Excel to insert pins](./geospatial-map-excel.md)
- [Show routes between waypoints](geospatial-map-routing.md)
- [Draw and insert shapes onto maps](./geospatial-map-draw-shapes.md)

## Other geospatial controls

To see dynamic address suggestions as you type, use the **[Address input](geospatial-component-input-address.md)** control.
