# Add informational cards to pins

You can add informational cards to each pin on the map. 

When a user selects the pin (either by hovering over it or selecting it directly), a small card will pop-up with information taken from the dataset you bound to the component, as described in the topic [Use data from Excel to insert pins](geospatial-map-excel.md#add-pin-data-from-an-excel-workbook).

Any column you add to the table in the data source (for example, the Excel table) will be available as a field to show on the card.

## Prerequisites
1. Create a Canvas app and make sure it meets the [Geospatial prerequisites](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites). 
2. In your app, [insert a map](geospatial-component-map.md#use-the-component). 


**To add informational cards to pins:**

1. First, bind the map to a dataset as described in [Use data from Excel to insert pins](geospatial-map-excel.md#add-pin-data-from-an-excel-workbook).

2. In the **Properties** pane, select **Show info cards** and choose whether they should appear when a user hovers over the pin, or if the user has to select the pin.

3. In the **Properties** pane, next to **Fields**, select **Edit**.

4. Select **Add field**, and then select each of the fields you want to show in the card. Select **Add**.

5. Each pin will now show the fields associated with that pin in an informational card.
