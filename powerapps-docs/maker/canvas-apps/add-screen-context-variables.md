# Add a screen

Prebuilt screens allow makers to easily create modern, responsive app by simply selecting a screen. The screens are designed with common app scenarios and compositions in mind, and feature responsive containers and modern controls.

> ![Screen layouts.](./media/add-screen-context-variables/add-a-screen.png)


The following new screens are available:

- [Welcome screen](add-screen-context-variables.md#welcome-screen)
- [Header and gallery](add-screen-context-variables.md#header-and-gallery-screen)
- [Approval request](add-screen-context-variables.md#approval-request-screen)


## Add a new screen

When you add a new screen, you can also select a screen layout such as blank or split screen that adapt to different screen sizes.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
2. Create a canvas app in tablet format.
3. In Power Apps Studio, on the command bar, select **New screen** and then select a screen.
1. When you're done, preview the app and see how the app displays on different devices. More information, see [Preview an app](preview-app.md).


When the **[Scale to fit](create-responsive-layout.md#disable-scale-to-fit)** option is turned off, the screen layout of the app adapts to the size of the device's screen it's being run on.


## Welcome screen 

The **Welcome screen** is ideal for the starting screen of an app. It contains individual tiles that you can customize with an image, a title, and a description text. The number of tiles on the screen can be easily changed by adding or removing the tiles within the body container. Each tile can be used to navigate users to other parts of the app.  

The **Welcome screen** contains the following controls:

- Header container
    - Header 
- Body container
    - Container 
        - Image container
            - Image (Classic)
        - Title container 
          - Feature item button 
          - Text 

#### Add and customize the Welcome screen

1. To remove a tile, in the tree view right click a **Container** and select **Delete**.  


## Header and gallery screen

Use the **Header and gallery** screen to showcase a wide range of product or service information, like a product catalog. When you connect a gallery control to a data source, a catalog is automatically generated with little customization required.

The [gallery control](controls/control-gallery.md) in **Header and gallery** screen is a classic control. However, when the modern gallery control is released, the **Header and gallery** screen use the modern gallery control. For more information, see [Overview of modern controls and themes in canvas apps](controls/modern-controls/overview-modern-controls.md).

## Approval request screen

The **Approval request** screen includes a header, a form featuring a submit button, and a gallery with predefined stages.

         - Gallery (Classic) 


#### Add and customize Approval request screen

1. In the tree view, select **Approval form** and connect it to a data source such as Dataverse.
1. To view the details of the approval stages, in the tree view, select **ReviewersGallery** and in the properties pane select the **Advanced** tab and go to **Items**. 

    The following details are part of the approval stage:
   - **Name**: Name of the stage or approver.

## Reorder screens

When you have more than one screen, you can reorder them.

In the left pane, hover over a screen that you want to move up or down, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the **[StartScreen](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/object-app#startscreen-property)** property to set which screen will be displayed first.

## Add navigation

When you create a canvas app with multiple screens, you can add navigation so your users can navigate between screens.


1. With the screen selected, select **Insert** and in the search box type **Next arrow** and then select it.

2. (optional) Move the arrow so that it appears in the lower-right corner of the screen.

3. With the arrow selected, set the **[OnSelect](controls/properties-core.md)** property to the **Navigate** function.

    ![OnSelect property set to Navigate function.](./media/add-screen-context-variables/onselect-default.png)

    When a user selects the arrow, the **Target** screen fades in.

4. On the **Target** screen, add a **Back arrow** icon, and set its **[OnSelect](controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    `Navigate(Target, ScreenTransition.Fade)`

   > [!NOTE]
   > In the formula above where it says **Target** enter the name of the screen that you're navigating to.
