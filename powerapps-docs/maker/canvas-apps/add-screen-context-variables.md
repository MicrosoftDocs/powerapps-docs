# Add and navigate screens in canvas apps

Create modern, responsive apps by adding prebuilt screens for common app scenarios. The screens feature responsive containers and modern controls that adapt to different screen sizes. You can also add custom screens with different layouts and controls.

The following new prebuilt screens are available:

- [Approval request](add-screen-context-variables.md#approval-request-screen)
- [Welcome screen](add-screen-context-variables.md#welcome-screen)
- [Header and gallery](add-screen-context-variables.md#header-and-gallery-screen)
- [Header and form](add-screen-context-variables.md#header-and-form)
- [Header and table](add-screen-context-variables.md#header-and-table)

:::image type="content" source="./media/add-screen-context-variables/add-a-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the New screen menu in Power Apps Studio showing available layouts.":::

## Add a new screen

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. Create a canvas app or open one for editing.

1. On the [command bar](power-apps-studio.md#1--power-apps-studio-modern-command-bar), select **New screen**, and then select a screen layout.

1. [Preview](power-apps-studio.md#preview) the app to determine how it looks on different devices. Learn more in [Preview an app](preview-app.md).

> [!TIP]
> To make the app adapt to the size of the device display it's being run on, turn off the **[Scale to fit](create-responsive-layout.md#disable-scale-to-fit)** option.

## Welcome screen

The **Welcome screen** is ideal for the first screen of an app, where you can customize tiles such as an image, a title, and a description. You can  change the number of tiles by adding or removing them in the main container. Use the tiles to navigate users to other parts of the app.  

The **Welcome screen** has the following template for controls:

- Screen container
  - Header container
    - Header
  - Main container
    - Container
      - Image container
        - Image
      - Title container
        - Feature item button
        - Description text

:::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/welcome-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows what appears when you add a Welcome screen layout from the New screen button." lightbox="media/add-screen-context-variables/welcome-screen.png":::

### Add and customize the Welcome screen

1. Select **New screen** > **Welcome screen**.

1. To change the image of a tile, select it and then select **Edit**.

1. Select the **Feature Item** button control and add your own text in the [Properties pane](power-apps-studio.md#8--properties-pane).

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/edit-featured-item-text.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to edit the text of the Featured item tile.":::

1. Select the **Short description or engaging message** text and add your own.

1. Add and remove tiles if needed.

    - To add tiles in the tree view, copy and paste a **Container** item.

    - To remove a tile in the tree view, right-click a **Container**, and then select **Delete**.  

## Header and gallery screen

Use the **Header and gallery** screen to show a range of product or service information, like a product catalog. When you connect a gallery control to a data source, a catalog is automatically created with little customization required.

The [gallery control](controls/control-gallery.md) in the **Header and gallery** screen is a classic control. When the modern gallery control is released, the **Header and gallery** screen uses it. Learn more in [Overview of modern controls and themes in canvas apps](controls/modern-controls/overview-modern-controls.md).

The **Header and gallery** screen has the following template for controls:

- Screen container
  - Header container
    - Header
  - Main container
    - Gallery
      - Gallery container
        - Image container
          - Image
        - Title container
          - Title text
          - Description text
        - Button container
          - Button

:::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/header-and-gallery-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Header and gallery screen." lightbox="media/add-screen-context-variables/header-and-gallery-screen.png":::

### Add and customize the Header and gallery screen

1. Select **New Screen** > **Header and gallery**.

1. In the tree view, select **Gallery** and connect it to a data source such as Dataverse.

1. Select specific controls inside the gallery, such as the image, title text, and text description. In the control's properties, use the *ThisItem* syntax to set the desired image, title text, and description.

   For example, to add the **Account name** to the title text control, find it by typing `ThisItem` in the formula bar to see a list of available items to add from your data set.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/thisitem-property.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to use ThisItem in the formula bar." lightbox="media/add-screen-context-variables/thisitem-property.png":::

## Approval request screen

The **Approval request** screen has a header, a form with a submit button, and a gallery with predefined stages. The **Approval request** screen is useful for scenarios where actions are triggered by form submissions, such as submitting an approval request or displaying a workflow process for a business.

   - **Current**: Whether this stage is the current stage of the approval request

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/items-reviewers-gallery.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Items advanced property.":::

You can add a Power Automate approval workflow in the button to notify the approver. Learn more in [Create and test an approval workflow with Power Automate](/power-automate/modern-approvals).

### Add and customize Table and form screen

In Power Apps Studio:

1. Select **New Screen** > **Table and form**.
1. Select **Data** in the inline action bar.

   :::image type="content" source="media\add-screen-context-variables\select-data-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the location of the Data button, where you can select a data source from a list.":::

   Once connected, the table and form controls are both bound to the data source.

You can select a record in the table control and the form displays the details of the selected record.

All buttons in this template have prebuilt Power Fx, so there's no need for further customization. When you connect the screen to the selected data source, the screen is now fully functional.

:::image type="content" source="media\add-screen-context-variables\screen-view-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the screen view when connected to a data source: a data list and its form elements with a submit button." lightbox="media\add-screen-context-variables\screen-view-connected.png" :::

## Reorder screens

When you have more than one screen in your app, you can put them in a different order in your tree view.

Select the overflow menu of a screen that you want to reorder, and then select **Move up** or **Move down**.

:::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/move-screen-up-down.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the overflow menu is located in order to move a screen up or down in your tree view.":::

Use the **[StartScreen](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/object-app#startscreen-property)** property to set the screen to be displayed first.

## Add navigation

When you have more than one screen in your app, you can add navigation so that your users can move between them.

1. With the screen selected, select **Insert**. In the search box, type **Next arrow** and then select it.

1. Move the arrow to where you want it to appear on the screen.

1. With the arrow selected, set the **[OnSelect](controls/properties-core.md)** property to the **Navigate** function; for example, **Navigate(*Target*, Fade)**.

    Replace *Target* with the name of the screen where you want to navigate.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-screen-context-variables/onselect-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the OnSelect property set to the Navigate function." lightbox="media/add-screen-context-variables/onselect-default.png":::

    In this example, when a user selects the arrow, the target screen fades in.

1. On the *Target* screen, add a **Back arrow** icon the same way. Set its [OnSelect](controls/properties-core.md) property, for example, `Navigate(Target, ScreenTransition.Fade)`.

   Replace *Target* with the name of the screen where you want to return.
