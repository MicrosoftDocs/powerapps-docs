# View predefined 3D shapes in mixed reality

Use the **View shape in MR** control in a canvas app to see whether a digital cube of a given size fits in a real-world space. (To compare a 3D model of an object instead, use the [**View in MR**](mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md) control.)

The **View shape in MR** control adds a button to your app. When a user selects the button, the app overlays a cube on the device camera feed. The cube's dimensions are set as a property on the control when you author the app in Microsoft Power Apps Studio. Users may not change the size of the cube while they use the app.

> [!TIP]
> The mixed-reality (MR) controls work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. Tracking is better on LIDAR-enabled devices.

> [!TIP]
> The MR controls in Power Apps use Babylon and Babylon React Native. Mixed reality content that works in the [Babylon sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) should work in Power Apps through this shared MR platform. If your content works in Babylon but not in Power Apps, ask a question in the [Power Apps Community Forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Get-Help-with-Power-Apps/ct-p/PA_General). (Tag it with "mixed reality.")

## Add a **View shape in MR** button to an app screen

With your app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Mixed Reality**.
2. Select **View shape in MR** to place the control in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.

The control is a button that's labeled with an icon of a cube and the text *Place a cube*. Change the label and hide the icon if you like in the **Text** and **Display type** properties.

### Properties

Change the **View shape in MR** button's behavior and appearance using properties. Some properties are only available on the **Advanced** tab.

### Output properties

Your app can make use of more properties when a user interacts with the **View shape in MR** control. These are known as output properties. You can use these properties in other controls or to customize the app experience.

| Property | Description | Type |
| - | - | - |
| Photos | Collects the photos captured during the mixed reality session. You can [upload the mixed-reality photos to OneDrive and show them in a gallery](mixed-reality-take-upload-photos.md). | Not applicable |

## Other mixed reality controls

- View 3D content with the **[3D object](mixed-reality-component-view-3d.md)** control.
- View images and 3D content in the real world with the **[View in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md)** control.
- Measure distance, area, and volume with the **[Measure in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md)** control.
