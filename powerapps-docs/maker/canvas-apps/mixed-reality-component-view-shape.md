# Create and view predefined 3D shapes in mixed reality (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use the **View shape in MR** component in your app to let users see if a simple cube might fit within a specified space. They might want to do this to see how a certain object that you provide would fit in their space. If you have a 3D model of your object, you might like to use [the **View in MR** component](mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md) instead.

The component creates a button in your app. When app users click the button, it overlays a cube onto the live camera feed of the device. You set up the dimensions of the cube when you edit the component in Power Apps.

To use the component, you need to [enable the mixed reality (MR) features for each app](mixed-reality-overview.md#enable-the-mixed-reality-features-for-each-app) that you want to use it in.

Make sure to also [review the prerequisites for using MR components](mixed-reality-overview.md#prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> The MR components work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. When establishing tracking, point the device at the surface you would like to track and slowly pan the device from right to left in broad arm motions. If tracking fails, exit and enter the MR view to reset the tracking and try again.

## Use the component

Insert the component into your app as you normally would for any other button control or component.

With an app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Mixed reality**.
3. Select the component **View shape in MR** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

You can modify the component with a number of properties.

### Properties

The following properties are on the component's **View shape in MR** pane on the **Properties** and **Advanced** tabs.
