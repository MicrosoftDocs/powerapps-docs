# Important upcoming changes and deprecations in canvas apps

The announcements for changes, and deprecations described in this article apply to canvas apps.

Makers, developers, and IT professionals can use this information to prepare for future releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Deprecated" means we intend to remove the feature or capability from a future major release. The feature or capability will continue to work and is fully supported until it is officially removed. This deprecation notification can span a few months or years. After removal, the feature or capability no longer work. This notice is to allow you sufficient time to plan and update your code before the feature or capability is removed.

## Map component fields using dropdown option

The capability to map component fields using dropdown option available through the **Advanced** tab for the selected component that's added to an app has been deprecated. To learn more about mapping component fields, alternatives, and this deprecation, go to [Map input fields of a component](map-component-input-fields.md).

## Rules feature in canvas apps is deprecated

Effective October 14, 2019, the [rules](working-with-rules.md) feature in canvas apps in Power Apps is deprecated. Few people have made use of rules in their canvas apps. From feedback collected through research and discussions with makers of Power Apps, the rules feature was confusing, and expressions were easier to learn, use, and debug. For more information about the rules feature deprecation, see [Blog: Canvas Rules feature deprecation](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/canvas-rules-feature-deprecation/).
