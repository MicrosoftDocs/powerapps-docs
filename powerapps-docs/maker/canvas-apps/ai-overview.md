# Copilot in Power Apps overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Copilot in Power Apps helps you build apps using natural language. You can build an app with a data model behind it, by having a conversation with Copilot. You don't need to write any code or design any screens. Copilot generates the app for you based on your description of the business solution.

Users can ask questions or give commands to the app, and Copilot responds with relevant insights or actions. All questions or commands can be in natural language, making your app more engaging and intuitive for your users.

In this article, you learn how to use Copilot features in Power Apps.
