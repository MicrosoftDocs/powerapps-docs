# What are canvas apps?


Canvas apps in Power Apps let you create business apps without coding. Power Apps provides a blank canvas where you can drag and drop components to design a user interface in any layout you prefer. Create Excel-like expressions for specifying logic and working with data. Build apps that integrate business data from a [wide variety of Microsoft and third-party sources](connections-list.md). Share your app so users can run it in a browser or on a mobile device, and embed your app so they can run it in SharePoint, Power BI, or Teams.

You can also create apps with Copilot in Power Apps by describing what you want the app to do using natural language, and AI handles the rest.


## Build an app

The following articles can help you build apps in different scenarios using Copilot:

- [Use the Plan designer (preview)](../plan-designer/plan-designer.md)
- [Build apps through conversation with Copilot](ai-conversations-create-app.md)
- [Edit your app with Copilot in Power Apps Studio (preview)](ai-edit-app.md)

You can also automatically generate an app from one of these sources:

- [A sample app](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md)
- [A template](get-started-test-drive.md)
- [Dataverse](data-platform-create-app.md)
- [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md)
- [Excel](get-started-create-from-data.md)

For more information on where makers can create apps, see [Get started with Power Apps](intro-maker-portal.md).

After generating an app automatically, customize its default appearance and behavior based on your users' workflows. For example, change which types of data appear, how they're sorted, or even whether users specify a number by typing it or adjusting a slider. Add and customize [screens](add-screen-context-variables.md), [galleries](customize-layout-sharepoint.md), [forms](customize-forms-sharepoint.md), and other controls.

After gaining some experience generating an app automatically and customizing it, you can create an app from scratch based on [Dataverse](data-platform-create-app-scratch.md), [Excel](get-started-create-from-blank.md), or another data source. By working from the ground up, you gain flexibility in app design, flow, and controls, and you can incorporate a larger variety of data sources.

If you're new to Power Apps and want to learn how to convert your ideas into a fully working solution, start with [Planning a Power Apps project](../../guidance/planning/introduction.md).

## Share and run an app
When you finish the app and save it to the cloud, [share it with others](share-app.md) in your organization. Specify which users or groups can run the app and whether they can also customize and share it with additional people in the organization.

Run your own apps (and any apps shared with you) on Windows, in a [web browser](../../user/run-app-browser.md), or on an [iOS or Android device](/powerapps/mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile).
