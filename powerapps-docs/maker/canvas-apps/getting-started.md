# What are canvas apps?


Canvas apps in Power Apps let you build business apps without coding. Power Apps gives you a blank canvas where you drag components to design a user interface in any layout you want. Use Excel-like expressions to specify logic and work with data. Build apps that use business data from a [wide variety of Microsoft and third-party sources](connections-list.md). Share your app so users run it in a browser or on a mobile device, and embed your app so they run it in SharePoint, Power BI, or Teams.

Create apps with Copilot in Power Apps by describing what you want the app to do in natural language, and AI handles the rest.


## Build an app

The following articles can help you build apps in different scenarios using Copilot:

- [Use the Plan designer (preview)](../plan-designer/plan-designer.md)
- [Build apps through conversation with Copilot](ai-conversations-create-app.md)
- [Edit your app with Copilot in Power Apps Studio (preview)](ai-edit-app.md)

You can also automatically generate an app from one of these sources:

- [A sample app](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md)
- [A template](get-started-test-drive.md)
- [Dataverse](data-platform-create-app.md)
- [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md)
- [Excel](get-started-create-from-data.md)

For more information on where makers can create apps, see [Get started with Power Apps](intro-maker-portal.md).

After you generate an app automatically, customize its default appearance and behavior based on your users' workflows. For example, change which types of data appear, how they're sorted, or whether users specify a number by typing it or adjusting a slider. Add and customize [screens](add-screen-context-variables.md), [galleries](customize-layout-sharepoint.md), [forms](customize-forms-sharepoint.md), and other controls.

After you generate and customize an app automatically, create an app from scratch based on [Dataverse](data-platform-create-app-scratch.md), [Excel](get-started-create-from-blank.md), or another data source. By working from the ground up, you get flexibility in app design, flow, and controls, and you can use a larger variety of data sources.

## Share and run an app
When you finish the app and save it to the cloud, [share it with others](share-app.md) in your organization. Specify which users or groups can run the app, and whether they can also customize and share it with more people in the organization.

Run your own apps, and any apps shared with you, on Windows, in a [web browser](../../user/run-app-browser.md), or on an [iOS or Android device](/powerapps/mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile).
