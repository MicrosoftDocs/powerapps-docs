# Delete a canvas app from PowerApps
This article shows you how to delete a canvas app from your PowerApps account and from the accounts of anybody with whom the app was shared.

## Delete an app from your account
1. Open [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Apps** in the left **Tree view** pane.
