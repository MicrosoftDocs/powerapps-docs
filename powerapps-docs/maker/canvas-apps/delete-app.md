# Delete a canvas app from PowerApps
This article shows you how to delete a canvas app from your PowerApps account and from the accounts of anybody with whom the app was shared.

## Delete an app from your account
1. Open [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Apps** in the left **Tree view** pane.

2. (optional) Near the upper-right corner, filter the list of apps to show only those apps that you own or only those apps to which you contribute.

    > [!NOTE]
   > If the app that you want to delete doesn't appear, make sure that you're in the right environment.
3. Select **More Commands** (...) for the app that you want to delete.
