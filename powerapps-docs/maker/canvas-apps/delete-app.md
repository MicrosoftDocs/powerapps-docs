1. Open [powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Apps** in the left **Tree view** pane.

2. (optional) Near the upper-right corner, filter the list of apps to show only those apps that you own or only those apps to which you contribute.

3. Select **More Commands** (...) for the app that you want to delete.
