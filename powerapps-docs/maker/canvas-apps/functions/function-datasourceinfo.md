# DataSourceInfo function in Power Apps
Provides information about a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md).

## Overview
Data sources can provide a wealth of information to optimize the user experience.

You can use [column](../working-with-tables.md#columns)-level information to validate user input and provide immediate feedback to the user before using the **[Patch](function-patch.md)** function. The **[Validate](function-validate.md)** function uses this same information.

You can use information at the data-source level, for example, to disable or hide **Edit** and **New** buttons for users who don't have permissions to edit and create [records](../working-with-tables.md#records).

Data sources vary in how much information they provide, including not providing any at all.  [Collections](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections) provide no information. If a piece of information isn't provided, a default is used, or *blank* is returned.

## Description
### Column information
You can use **DataSourceInfo** to obtain information about a particular column of a data source:  

| Information Argument | Result Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DataSourceInfo.DisplayName** |String |Display name for the column. If no display name is defined, returns the column name. |
| **DataSourceInfo.MaxLength** |Number |Maximum number of characters that the column can hold. Applies only to columns that contain strings. If a maximum isn't set, returns *blank*. |
| **DataSourceInfo.MaxValue** |Number |Maximum numeric value that a column can hold. Applies only to columns that contain numbers. If a maximum isn't set, returns *blank*. |
| **DataSourceInfo.MinValue** |Number |Minimum numeric value that a column can hold. Applies only to columns that contain numbers. If a minimum isn't set, returns *blank*. |
| **DataSourceInfo.Required** |Boolean |Is a value required for this column? If not set by the data source, returns **false**. |

The third argument is the name of a column as a string.  For example, column **Phone** in collection **People** would be passed as **"Phone"** including the double quotes.

### Data-source information
You can also use **DataSourceInfo** to obtain information about a data source as a whole:  

| Information Argument | Result Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DataSourceInfo.AllowedValues** |Boolean |What types of permissions can users be granted for this data source? If not set by the data source, returns *blank*. |
| **DataSourceInfo.CreatePermission** |Boolean |Does the current user have permission to create records in this data source? If not set by the data source, returns **true**. |
| **DataSourceInfo.DeletePermission** |Boolean |Does the current user have permission to delete records in this data source? If not set by the data source, returns **true**. |
| **DataSourceInfo.EditPermission** |Boolean |Does the current user have permission to edit records in this data source? If not set by the data source, returns **true**. |
| **DataSourceInfo.ReadPermission** |Boolean |Does the current user have permission to read records in this data source? If not set by the data source, returns **true**. |

## Syntax
**DataSourceInfo**( *DataSource*, *Information*, *ColumnName* )

* *DataSource* – Required. The data source to use.
* *Information* – Required. The type of information that you want to retrieve.
* *ColumnName* – Optional. For column-level information, the column name as a string. Column **Phone** would be passed as **"Phone"**, including the double quotes. For information at the data-source level, the *ColumnName* argument can't be used.
  
    > [!NOTE]
  > For SharePoint and Excel data sources that contain column names with spaces, specify each space as **"\_x0020\_"**. For example, specify **"Column Name"** as **"Column_x0020_Name"**.

## Examples
The examples in this section use this data source, named **IceCream**:

![Icecream](media/function-datasourceinfo/icecream.png "Icecream")

The data source has also provided this information:

* The display name for **Quantity** is "Quantity on Hand".
* The maximum length of **Flavor** is 30 characters.
* The **Flavor** column must contain a value. The **Quantity** column isn't required.
* The minimum **Quantity** is 0.
* The maximum **Quantity** is 100.
* The current user can read and edit the records of the **IceCream** data source but can't create or delete records.
