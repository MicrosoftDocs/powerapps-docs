# RecordInfo function in Power Apps
Provides information about a [record](../working-with-tables.md#elements-of-a-table) of a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md).

Use **RecordInfo** to obtain information about a particular record of a data source.  The data source must be tabular and compatible with the [**Remove**](function-remove-removeif.md) and [**Patch**](function-patch.md) functions.  

At this time, only Microsoft Dataverse is supported.  Records from all other data sources will result in a formula error.

The information available:

| Information argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **RecordInfo.DeletePermission** | Does the current user have permission to remove this record from the data source? |
| **RecordInfo.EditPermission** | Does the current user have permission to modify this record in the data source? |
| **RecordInfo.ReadPermission** | Does the current user have permission to read this record from the data source? |

**RecordInfo** returns a Boolean value:

| Return value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *true* | The user has the permission. |
| *false* | The user does not have permission.  If the record is *blank* then **RecordInfo** will also return *false*. |

**RecordInfo** takes into account permissions at the data source level too.  For example, if the user has permission at the record level to modify a record, but the user does not have permissions at the table level, then it will return *false* for **ModifyPermission**.  Use the [**DataSourceInfo**](function-datasourceinfo.md) function to obtain information about the data source as a whole.

## Syntax
**RecordInfo**( *Record*, *Information* )

* *Record* – Required. The record to test.
* *Information* – Required. The desired information for the record.

## Examples

```powerapps-dot
RecordInfo( First(Accounts), RecordInfo.EditPermission )
```
Checks the edit permission for the first record in the `Accounts` data source, which could be in Dataverse, SharePoint, SQL Server, or another tabular data source.  If the user has permission to edit this record and modify the `Accounts` data source in general, then **RecordInfo** will return *true*.  

```powerapps-dot
With( { MyRecord: First( Accounts ) }, 
      RecordInfo( MyRecord, RecordInfo.EditPermission ) )
```
Captures a record using the [**With**](function-with.md) function and then passes this value to the `RecordInfo` function.  The result will be the same as the last example.

```powerapps-dot
Collect( MyAccounts, FirstN( Accounts, 10 ) );
RecordInfo( First( MyAccounts ), RecordInfo.EditPermission ) )
```
Captures the first 10 records from the `Accounts` data source into the `MyAccounts` collection.  Since the records originated from a data source, they can be used with the **RecordInfo** function.  The result will be the same as the last example.

```powerapps-dot
Collect( MyCollection, [ 1, 2, 3 ] );
RecordInfo( First(MyCollection), RecordInfo.DeletePermission )
```
Creates the `MyCollection` collection and tests the first record to determine if it can be removed.  Since the record's origin is a collection and not a data source, **RecordInfo** will return an error.
