# User function in Power Apps

Returns information about the current user.

## Description

The **User** function returns a [record](../working-with-tables.md#records) of information about the current user:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **User().Email** |Email address of the current user. The `User().Email` function returns the user's UPN and not the SMTP email address.|
| **User().FullName** |Full name of the current user, including first and last names. |
| **User().Image** |Image of the current user. This will be an image URL of the form "blob:*identifier*". Set the **[Image](../controls/properties-visual.md)** property of the **[Image](../controls/control-image.md)** control to this value to display the image in the app. |

> [!NOTE]
> The information returned is for the current Power Apps user.  It will match the "Account" information that is displayed in the Power Apps players and studio, which can be found outside of any authored apps.  This may not match the current user's information in Office 365 or other services.

> [!NOTE]
> If you published your application with a User function prior to March 2020, you may find that it, intermittently, will not retrieve photos. The issues were fixed in the late March 2020 release.  To take advantage of the updated implementation, simply re-open your application, save it, and republish it.  

## Syntax
