## in and exactin operators
You can use the **[in](operators.md#in-and-exactin-operators)** and **[exactin](operators.md#in-and-exactin-operators)** operators to find a string in a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md), such as a collection or an imported table. The **[in](operators.md#in-and-exactin-operators)** operator identifies matches regardless of case, and the **[exactin](operators.md#in-and-exactin-operators)** operator identifies matches only if they're capitalized the same way. Here's an example:

1. Create or import a collection named **Inventory**, and show it in a gallery, as the first procedure in [Show images and text in a gallery](../show-images-text-gallery-sort-filter.md) describes.
2. Set the **[Items](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the gallery to this formula:
   <br>**Filter(Inventory, "E" in ProductName)**

    The gallery shows all products except Callisto because the name of that product is the only one that doesn't contain the letter you specified.
3. Change the **[Items](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the gallery to this formula:
   <br>**Filter(Inventory, "E" exactin ProductName)**

    The gallery shows only Europa because only its name contains the letter that you specified in the case that you specified.

## ThisItem operator
You can show data in **[Gallery](../controls/control-gallery.md)**, **[Edit form](../controls/control-form-detail.md)**, or **[Display form](../controls/control-form-detail.md)** controls by binding it to a table or a collection.  These controls are a container for other cards and controls.  Each card or control within the container can access the bound data through the **[ThisItem](operators.md#thisitem-operator)** operator.   

You use the **[ThisItem](operators.md#thisitem-operator)** operator to specify the [column](../working-with-tables.md#columns) of data that each card or control within the outer control. For example, that operator in the product gallery for [Show images and text in a gallery](../show-images-text-gallery-sort-filter.md) specified that the image control showed the product design, the upper label showed the product name, and the lower label showed the number of units in stock.

For nested galleries, **[ThisItem](operators.md#thisitem-operator)** refers to the innermost gallery's items. Assuming the row fields in the inner and outer galleries don't conflict, you can also use the unqualified field (column) names directly. This approach enables rules in an inner gallery to refer to an outer gallery's items.

## Parent operator
Some controls host other controls. For example, **[Screen](../controls/control-screen.md)**, **[Gallery](../controls/control-gallery.md)**, **[Card](../controls/control-card.md)**, **[Edit form](../controls/control-form-detail.md)**, and **[Display form](../controls/control-form-detail.md)** controls are all containers for controls. We call the hosting control the "parent" of the controls within.

Any control in PowerApps can be referenced by name from anywhere within the app. **Screen1** may be the name of a screen in your app. To retrieve the background color of this screen, you can use **Screen1.Fill**.

Controls on this screen have another option. They can use a relative reference: **Parent.Fill**. The **[Parent](operators.md#parent-operator)** operator refers to the control that hosts this control, making available all of its properties. Using **[Parent](operators.md#parent-operator)** is helpful because it doesn't depend on the name of the control. You can copy and paste a container control without needing to adjust any references within the container. This operator also makes the relationship between child and parent controls clearer when reading formulas.

## Disambiguation operator
Some functions create [record scopes](../working-with-tables.md#record-scope) for accessing the fields of table while processing each record, such as **Filter**, **AddColumns**, and **Sum**.  Field names added with the record scope override the same names from elsewhere in the app.  When this happens, you can still access values from outside the record scope with the **@** disambiguation operator:

* To access values from nested record scopes, use the **@** operator with the name of the table being operated upon using this pattern:<br>_Table_**[@**_FieldName_**]**
* To access global values, such as data sources, collections, and context variables, use the pattern **[@**_ObjectName_**]** (without a table designation).

For more information and examples, see [record scopes](../working-with-tables.md#record-scope).
