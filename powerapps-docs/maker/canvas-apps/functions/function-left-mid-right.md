# Left, Mid, and Right functions in Power Apps
Extracts the left, middle, or right portion of a string of text.

## Description
The **Left**, **Mid**, and **Right** functions return a portion of a string.

* **Left** returns the beginning characters of a string.
* **Mid** returns the middle characters of a string.
* **Right** returns the ending characters of a string.

If you specify a single string as an argument, the function returns the portion that you requested of the string. If you specify a single-column [table](../working-with-tables.md) that contains strings, the function returns a single-column table of the portions that you requested of those strings. If you specify a multi-column table, you can shape it into a single-column table, as [working with tables](../working-with-tables.md) describes.

If the starting position is negative or beyond the end of the string, **Mid** returns *blank*.  You can check the length of a string by using the **[Len](function-len.md)** function. If you request more characters than the string contains, the function returns as many characters as possible.

## Syntax
**Left**( *String*, *NumberOfCharacters* )<br>**Mid**( *String*, *StartingPosition* [, *NumberOfCharacters* ] )<br>**Right**( *String*, *NumberOfCharacters* )

* *String* - Required. The string to from which to extract the result.
* *StartingPosition* - Required (**Mid** only).  The starting position.  The first character of the string is position 1.
* *NumberOfCharacters* - Required (**Left** and **Right** only).  The number of characters to return.  If omitted for the **Mid** function, the function returns the portion from the starting position until the end of the string.

**Left**( *SingleColumnTable*, *NumberOfCharacters* )<br>**Mid**( *SingleColumnTable*, *StartingPosition* [, *NumberOfCharacters* ] )<br>**Right**( *SingleColumnTable*, *NumberOfCharacters* )

* *SingleColumnTable* - Required. A single-column table of strings from which to extract the results.
* *StartingPosition* - Required (**Mid** only).  The starting position.  The first character of the string is position 1.
* *NumberOfCharacters* - Required (**Left** and **Right** only).  The number of characters to return.  If omitted for the **Mid** function, the function returns the portion from the starting position until the end of the string.

## Examples
### Single string
The examples in this section use a text-input control as their [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md). The control is named **Author** and contains the string "E. E. Cummings".

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Left( Author.Text, 5 )** |Extracts up to five characters from the start of the string. |"E. E." |
| **Mid( Author.Text, 7, 4 )** |Extracts up to four characters, starting with the seventh character, from the string. |"Cumm" |
| **Mid( Author.Text, 7 )** |Extracts all characters, starting with the seventh character, from the string. |"Cummings" |
| **Right( Author.Text, 5 )** |Extracts up to five characters from the end of the string. |"mings" |

### Single-column table
Each example in this section extracts strings from the **Address** [column](../working-with-tables.md#columns) of this data source, named **People**, and returns a single-column table that contains the results:

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Left( ShowColumns(&nbsp;People,&nbsp;"Address"&nbsp;), 8 )** |Extracts the first eight characters of each string. | ![](media/function-left-mid-right/people-table-left.png) |
| **Mid( ShowColumns(&nbsp;People,&nbsp;"Address"&nbsp;), 5, 7 )** |Extracts the middle seven characters of each string, starting with the fifth character. |![](media/function-left-mid-right/people-table-mid.png) |
| **Right( ShowColumns(&nbsp;People,&nbsp;"Address"&nbsp;), 7 )** |Extracts the last seven characters of each string. |![](media/function-left-mid-right/people-table-right.png) |

### Step-by-step example
1. Import or create a [collection](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections) named **Inventory**, and show it in a gallery, as the first procedure in [Show images and text in a gallery](../show-images-text-gallery-sort-filter.md) describes.
2. Set the **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the lower label in the gallery to this function:
   
    **Right(ThisItem.ProductName, 3)**
   
    The label shows the last three characters of each product name.
