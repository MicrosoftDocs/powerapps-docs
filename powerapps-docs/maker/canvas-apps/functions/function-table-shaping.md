# AddColumns, DropColumns, RenameColumns, and ShowColumns functions in Power Apps
Shapes a [table](../working-with-tables.md) by adding, dropping, renaming, and selecting its [columns](../working-with-tables.md#columns).

## Overview
These functions shape a table by adjusting its columns:

* Reduce a table that contains multiple columns down to a single column for use with single-column functions, such as **[Lower](function-lower-upper-proper.md)** or **[Abs](function-numericals.md)**.  
* Add a calculated column to a table (for example, a **Total Price** column that shows the results of multiplying **Quantity** by **Unit Price**).
* Rename a column to something more meaningful, for display to users or for use in formulas.

A table is a value in Power Apps, just like a string or a number.  You can specify a table as an argument in a formula, and functions can return a table as a result.

> [!NOTE]
> The functions that this topic describes don't modify the original table. Instead, they take that table as an argument and return a new table with a transform applied. See [working with tables](../working-with-tables.md) for more details.  

You can't modify the columns of a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md) by using these functions. You must modify the data at its source. You can add columns to a [collection](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections) with the **[Collect](function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function. See [working with data sources](../working-with-data-sources.md) for more details.  

## Description
The **AddColumns** function adds a column to a table, and a formula defines the values in that column. Existing columns remain unmodified.

The formula is evaluated for each record of the table.
[!INCLUDE [record-scope](../../../includes/record-scope.md)]

The **DropColumns** function excludes columns from a table.  All other columns remain unmodified. **DropColumns** excludes columns, and **ShowColumns** includes columns.

Use the **RenameColumns** function to rename one or more columns of a table by providing at least one argument pair that specifies the name of a column that the table contains (the old name, which you want to replace) and the name of a column that the table doesn't contain (the new name, which you want to use). The old name must already exist in the table, and the new name must not exist. Each column name may appear only once in the argument list as either an old column name or a new column name. To rename a column to an existing column name, first drop the existing column with **DropColumns**, or rename the existing column out of the way by nesting one **RenameColumns** function within another.

The **ShowColumns** function includes columns of a table and drops all other columns. You can use **ShowColumns** to create a single-column table from a multi-column table.  **ShowColumns** includes columns, and **DropColumns** excludes columns.  

For all these functions, the result is a new table with the transform applied. The original table isn't modified. You can't modify an existing table with a formula. SharePoint, Microsoft Dataverse, SQL Server, and other data sources provide tools for modifying the columns of lists, entities, and tables, which are often referred to as the schema. The functions in this topic only transform an input table, without modifying the original, into an output table for further use.

The arguments to these functions support delegation. For example, a **Filter** function used as an argument to pull in related records searches through all listings, even if the **'[dbo].[AllListings]'** data source contains a million rows:

```powerapps-dot
AddColumns( RealEstateAgents, 
	"Listings",  
	Filter(  '[dbo].[AllListings]', ListingAgentName = AgentName ) 
)
```

However, the output of these functions is subject to the [non-delegation record limit](../delegation-overview.md#non-delegable-limits).  In this example, only 500 records are returned even if the **RealEstateAgents** data source has 501 or more records.

If you use **AddColumns** in this manner, **Filter** must make separate calls to the data source for each of those first records in **RealEstateAgents**, which causes a lot of network chatter. If **[dbo].[AllListings]** is small enough and doesn't change often, you could call the **Collect** function in [**OnStart**](signals.md#app) to cache the data source in your app when it starts. As an alternative, you could restructure your app so that you pull in the related records only when the user asks for them.  

## Syntax
**AddColumns**( *Table*, *ColumnName1*, *Formula1* [, *ColumnName2*, *Formula2*, ... ] )

* *Table* - Required.  Table to operate on.
* *ColumnName(s)* - Required. Name(s) of the column(s) to add.  You must specify a string (for example, **"Name"** with double quotes included) for this argument.
* *Formula(s)* - Required.  Formula(s) to evaluate for each record. The result is added as the value of the corresponding new column. You can reference other columns of the table in this formula.

**DropColumns**( *Table*, *ColumnName1* [, *ColumnName2*, ... ] )

* *Table* - Required.  Table to operate on.
* *ColumnName(s)* - Required. Name(s) of the column(s) to drop. You must specify a string (for example, **"Name"** with double quotes included) for this argument.

**RenameColumns**( *Table*, *OldColumnName1*, *NewColumnName1* [, *OldColumnName2*, *NewColumnName2*, ... ] )

* *Table* - Required.  Table to operate on.
* *OldColumnName* - Required. Name of a column to rename from the original table. This element appears first in the argument pair (or first in each argument pair if the formula includes more than one pair). This name must be a string (for example **"Name"** with double quotation marks included).
* *NewColumnName* - Required. Replacement name. This element appears last in the argument pair (or last in each argument pair if the formula includes more than one pair). You must specify a string (for example, **"Customer Name"** with double quotation marks included) for this argument.

**ShowColumns**( *Table*, *ColumnName1* [, *ColumnName2*, ... ] )

* *Table* - Required.  Table to operate on.
* *ColumnName(s)* - Required. Name(s) of the column(s) to include. You must specify a string (for example, **"Name"** with double quotes included) for this argument.

## Examples
The examples in this section use the **IceCreamSales** data source, which contains the data in this table:

![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream.png)

None of these examples modify the **IceCreamSales** data source. Each function transforms the value of the data source as a table and returns that value as the result.

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AddColumns( IceCreamSales, "Revenue", UnitPrice * QuantitySold )** |Adds a **Revenue** column to the result.  For each record, **UnitPrice * QuantitySold** is evaluated, and the result is placed in the new column. | ![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-add-revenue.png) |
| **DropColumns( IceCreamSales, "UnitPrice" )** |Excludes the **UnitPrice** column from the result. Use this function to exclude columns, and use **ShowColumns** to include them. |![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-drop-price.png) |
| **ShowColumns( IceCreamSales, "Flavor" )** |Includes only the **Flavor** column in the result. Use this function include columns, and use **DropColumns** to exclude them. |![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-select-flavor.png) |
| **RenameColumns( IceCreamSales, "UnitPrice", "Price")** |Renames the **UnitPrice** column in the result. |![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-rename-price.png) |
| **RenameColumns( IceCreamSales, "UnitPrice", "Price", "QuantitySold", "Number")** |Renames the **UnitPrice** and **QuantitySold** columns in the result. |![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-rename-price-quant.png) |
| **DropColumns(<br>RenameColumns(<br>AddColumns( IceCreamSales, "Revenue",<br>UnitPrice * QuantitySold ),<br>"UnitPrice", "Price" ),<br>"Quantity" )** |Performs the following table transforms in order, starting from the inside of the formula: <ol><li>Adds a **Revenue** column based on the per-record calculation of **UnitPrice * Quantity**.<li>Renames **UnitPrice** to **Price**.<li>Excludes the **Quantity** column.</ol>  Note that order is important. For example, we can't calculate with **UnitPrice** after it has been renamed. |![](media/function-table-shaping/icecream-all-transforms.png) |

### Step by step

Let's try some of the examples from earlier in this topic.  

1. Create a collection by adding a **[Button](../controls/control-button.md)** control and setting its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

	```powerapps-dot
	ClearCollect( IceCreamSales, 
		Table(
        	{ Flavor: "Strawberry", UnitPrice: 1.99, QuantitySold: 20 }, 
        	{ Flavor: "Chocolate", UnitPrice: 2.99, QuantitySold: 45 },
        	{ Flavor: "Vanilla", UnitPrice: 1.50, QuantitySold: 35 }
		)
	)
	```

1. Run the formula by selecting the button while holding down the Alt key.

1. Add a second **Button** control, set its **OnSelect** property to this formula, and then run it:

	```powerapps-dot
	ClearCollect( FirstExample, 
		AddColumns( IceCreamSales, "Revenue", UnitPrice * QuantitySold )
	) 
	```
1. On the **File** menu, select **Collections**, and then select **IceCreamSales** to show that collection.
 
	As this graphic shows, the second formula didn't modify this collection. The **AddColumns** function used **IceCreamSales** as a read-only argument; the function didn't modify the table to which that argument refers.
	
	![Collection viewer showing three records of the Ice Cream Sales collection that doesn't include a Revenue column](media/function-table-shaping/ice-cream-sales-collection.png)

1. Select **FirstExample**.

	As this graphic shows, the second formula returned a new table with the added column. The **ClearCollect** function captured the new table in the **FirstExample** collection, adding something to the original table as it flowed through the function without modifying the source:
