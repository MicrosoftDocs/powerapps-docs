# Launch and Param functions in Power Apps

Launches a webpage or a canvas app and provides access to launch parameters.

## Launch

Launches a webpage or a canvas app.  The function supports:

- **Address** (required), the URL of the webpage or App ID of the canvas app.
- **Parameters** (optional), named values to pass to the webpage or canvas app.  In a canvas app, parameters can be read with the [**Param**](#param) function.
- **Target** (optional), the browser tab in which to launch the webpage or canvas app.

**Launch** can only be used in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md).

### Address

Webpages are launched via a URL address.  For example:

```powerapps-dot
Launch( "https://bing.com" )
```  

You can launch canvas apps with **Web link** or **App ID**. To find these values for an app:

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select **Apps** from left navigation pane.
1. Select your app.
1. Select **Details** from top menu. <br> You can also select **...** (**More Commands**) and then select **Details** from the drop-down menu.

    ![App details option](media/function-param/portal-details.png "App details option")

1. Copy **Web link** or **App ID**.
    
    ![App details with web link and app id](media/function-param/portal-links.png "App details with web link and app id")

The **Web link** can be used in any web page and will launch the canvas app.  It can also be used with the **Launch** function.

The **App ID** can be used with the **Launch** function, but must be prefixed with `/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/`.  For example:

```powerapps-dot
Launch( "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/f342faaf-5f82-4ace-a64b-7c1b01499231" )
```

Native apps on a device can't be launched directly. There may be indirect options available on some platforms, such as a native app installing a custom URL scheme or registering with the web browser to offer an option for specific web sites.

### Parameters

**Launch** can pass parameters to the webpage or canvas app. Parameters can be provided in two ways:

- An argument list of name value pairs. For example:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Launch( "http://bing.com/search", "q", "Power Apps", "count", 1 )
    ```

- A record of field values. For example:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Launch( "http://bing.com/search", { q: "Power Apps", count: 1 } )
    ```

    This form can be easier to work with as it makes the association between name and value clearer. It's the only form that supports the optional *LaunchTarget* argument.

> [!NOTE]
> The record option for parameters is currently in **Preview** and will be released in all regions soon. For more details about preview features, go to [Understand experimental, preview, and deprecated features in Power Apps](../working-with-experimental-preview.md).

The address and parameters are URL encoded before being passed to replace certain non-alphanumeric characters with `%` and a hexadecimal number as if the [**EncodeUrl**](function-encode-decode.md) function has been used on each.

When launching a webpage, a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) of parameters can be included at the end of the URL address.  Any additional parameters provided to **Launch** will be added to the end of the query string. Query strings don't work when launching a canvas app.

### Target

> [!NOTE]
> The *LaunchTarget* argument is currently in **Preview** and will be released in all regions soon. For more details about preview features, go to [Understand experimental, preview, and deprecated features in Power Apps](../working-with-experimental-preview.md).

Use the *LaunchTarget* argument to specify the target browser window in which to open the webpage or app.  Use one of the following **LaunchTarget** enum values or provide a custom window *name*.

| LaunchTarget&nbsp;enum | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **New** | The webpage or app is opened in a new window or tab. |
| **Replace** | The webpage or app replaces the current window or tab. |
| *name* | Instead of an enum value, use your own text string to *name* the window or tab.  *Self* is an internal only name that is only used by the **Launch** function. It has no impact on nor will it match the title of the window that your users see.  If a window or tab with the given *name* already exists, its contents will be replaced. Otherwise, a new window or tab will be created.  *name* can't begin with the underscore character "_". |

**New** is the default enum when running in a web browser with **Replace** and *name* as available options. In a mobile player, **New** is the default for webpages with *name* as an available option; while the current canvas app will always be replaced by another canvas app.

> [!NOTE]
> - Using a *LaunchTarget* with any value other than **New** in embedded scenarios (for example, Power BI or SharePoint) is not supported and may result in unexpected behavior. In the future, this behavior may change, or may cause an error.
<!-- *LaunchTarget* enum names are in transition. You may use **Blank** and **Self** currently, though these names will change in the future. **Self** will go through an intermediate change to **'Self'** as a new **Self** keyword is introduced. To avoid this conflict, the expected names may be **New** and **Replace**. Your app will automatically update when these changes occur. Your formulas won't need an update manually.-->

### Security zones

In Internet Explorer and classic Microsoft Edge, the **Launch** function opens a website or canvas app only if its security settings are the same or higher than the calling app.

For example, if you add the **Launch** function to an app that will run in the **Trusted sites** security zone, ensure that the website or app you want the function to open is in the **Trusted sites** or **Local intranet** zone (not in **Restricted sites**). More information: [Change security and privacy settings for Internet Explorer 11](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17479/windows-internet-explorer-11-change-security-privacy-settings).  

## Param

The **Param** function retrieves a parameter passed to the app when it was launched. If the named parameter wasn't passed, **Param** returns *blank*.

- When launching a canvas app from another canvas app, use the *Parameter* arguments to the **Launch** function.  Parameter names and values will be automatically URL encoded.
- When launching a canvas app from a web page, add parameters to the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) of the [canvas app web link](#address).  This involves adding `&parametername=parametervalue` assuming the query string has already been started for the `tenantId`.  For example, adding `&First%20Name=Vicki&category=3` would pass two parameters: `First Name` with a value of `"Vicki"` and `category` with a value of `"3"` (value type is *text*).  The parameter name and value must be URL encoded if they contain spaces or special characters, similar to using the [**EncodeURL**](function-encode-decode.md) function.
- Param names are case-sensitive.  
- Param names and values will be automatically URL decoded for use in your app.
- Even if the parameter contains a number, the type returned by **Param** will always be a text string.  Conversion to other types will automatically occur or use explicit conversions such as the [**Value**](function-value.md) function to convert explicitly to a number.

## Syntax

**Launch**( *Address* [, *ParameterName1*, *ParameterValue1*, ... ] )

* *Address* – Required.  The address of a webpage or the ID of an app to launch.

## Examples

### Simple Launch

#### From a canvas app to a web page:

| Formula | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Launch(&nbsp;"http://bing.com/search",&nbsp;<br>"q",&nbsp;"Power&nbsp;Apps",&nbsp;"count",&nbsp;1&nbsp;)** | Opens the webpage **http://bing.com/search?q=Power%20Apps&count=1**.  A new window or tab is opened. |  
| **Launch(&nbsp;"http://bing.com/search",&nbsp;<br>{&nbsp;q:&nbsp;"Power&nbsp;Apps",&nbsp;count:&nbsp;1&nbsp;}&nbsp;)** | The same as the previous examples using the equivalent record notation.  A new window or tab is opened. | 
| **Launch(&nbsp;"http://bing.com/search",&nbsp;<br>{&nbsp;q:&nbsp;"Power&nbsp;Apps",&nbsp;count:&nbsp;1&nbsp;},&nbsp;<br>LaunchTarget.Self&nbsp;)** | The same as the previous examples, replacing the current window or tab with the result if running in a web browser. | 
| **Launch(&nbsp;"http://bing.com/search",&nbsp;<br>{&nbsp;q:&nbsp;"Power&nbsp;Apps",&nbsp;count:&nbsp;1&nbsp;},&nbsp;<br>"Search&nbsp;Results"&nbsp;)** | The same as the previous example, creating or replacing the contents of the window or tab named **Search Results**. |

#### From a canvas app to a canvas app

Update the app ID, screen name, and record number as appropriate.

```powerapps-dot
Launch( "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/YOUR-APP-ID",
        { Navigate: "Second Screen", Record: 34 }
)
```

#### From a web page to a canvas app

Update the app ID, tenant ID, screen name, and record number as appropriate.

```html
<html><body>
    <a href="https://apps.powerapps.com/play/YOUR-APP-ID?tenantId=YOUR-TENANT-ID&Navigate=Second%20Screen&Record=34">
        Launch canvas app
    </a>
</body></html>
```

### Simple Param

Simple launch examples above to launch canvas app [from web page](#from-a-web-page-to-a-canvas-app) or [from another canvas app](#from-a-canvas-app-to-a-canvas-app) show simple examples for Param function:

| Formula | Description | Result |
| ------- | ----------- |-------|
| **Param(&nbsp;"Navigate"&nbsp;)** | The **Navigate** parameter was provided when the app was launched and is returned. | "Second Screen" |
| **Param(&nbsp;"Record"&nbsp;)** | The **Record** parameter was provided when the app was launched.  Even though it was passed in as a number to the **Launch** function, the result from **Param** will be a text string that can be implicitly or explicitly converted to other types.  | "34" |
| **Param(&nbsp;"User"&nbsp;)**  | The **User** parameter wasn't provided.  A *blank* value is returned that can be tested with the [**IsBlank**](function-isblank-isempty.md) function. | *blank* |

### Step by Step examples for Launch and Param

The **Product Showcase** tablet layout template was used for the following examples. To create an app with this template, follow the steps from [create an app](../get-started-test-drive.md) article and select the **Product Showcase** template. You can also use your own app.

#### Example - Launch

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select **Apps** from left navigation pane.
1. Select your app and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Insert** from the menu and then select **Label**.
1. Move the label to the bottom right of the screen.
1. From the properties pane on the right-side, select **Color** as *white* and set **Border thickness** at *1*.
1. Select the **Text** property from right-side and enter text as *Surface tablets in news*.
1. From property list on top left, select **OnSelect**.
1. Enter formula as ```Launch("https://www.bing.com/news/search","q","Microsoft Surface tablets")```. You can also use any other URL, parameter, and keywords of your choice.

    ![Launch example](media/function-param/launch-example-onselect.png "Launch example")

1. Save and publish the app.
1. Play the app.
1. Select label **Surface tablets in news** to launch news search with keywords *Microsoft Surface tablets*.

> [!TIP]
> For scalability, you can replace the manually entered keywords in Launch function with [variables](../working-with-variables.md).

#### Example - Param

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select **Apps** from left navigation pane.
1. Select your app and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Insert** from the menu and then select **Label**.
1. Move the label to the bottom right of the screen.
1. Select **Text** property for the label from top left.
1. Enter formula as ```Param("browser")```. You can also use a different parameter of your choice.

    ![Param example](media/function-param/param-example.png "Param example")

1. Save and publish the app.
1. Copy [web link](#address) for your app from [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Open a new browser.
1. Paste the app web link in the browser and append ```&browser=Microsoft%20Edge``` at the end.

    ![Web address](media/function-param/param-example-web-address.png "Web address")

1. When your app launches, the label shows the parameter value passed.

    ![Param example label](media/function-param/param-example-label.png "Param example label")

1. Close the app player and edit the app.
1. Select **App** from the Tree view on left navigation.
1. Select **OnStart** property on top left.
1. Enter the formula as ```If(Param("screen")="techspecs",Navigate(TechSpecs,Fade))```.  

    ![Param example for navigation](media/function-param/param-example-screen.png "Param example for navigation")

    [If function](function-if.md) in [OnStart](object-app.md#onstart-property) property checks if parameter equals a certain value, in this case the value *techspecs*. And if it matches, the app navigates to *TechSpecs* screen.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace **TechSpecs** screen name in the Navigate function with name of a screen in your own app if you're not using the **Product Showcase** app template.

1. Save and publish the app.
1. Open a new browser.
1. Paste the app web link in the browser and append ```&screen=techspecs``` at the end.

    ![Web address for TechSpecs screen](media/function-param/param-example-web-address-techspecs.png "Web address for TechSpecs screen")

1. The app directly launches with **TechSpecs** or a screen you entered in Navigate function.
