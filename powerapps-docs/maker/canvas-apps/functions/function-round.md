# Round, RoundDown, and RoundUp functions in Power Apps
Rounds a number.

## Description
The **Round**, **RoundDown**, and **RoundUp** functions round a number to the specified number of decimal places:

* **Round** rounds up if the next digit is a 5 or higher. Otherwise, this function rounds down.
* **RoundDown** always rounds down to the previous lower number.
* **RoundUp** always rounds up to the next higher number.

If you pass a single number, the return value is the rounded version of that number.  If you pass a single-column [table](../working-with-tables.md) that contains numbers, the return value is a single-column table of rounded numbers. If you have a multi-column table, you can shape it into a single-column table, as [working with tables](../working-with-tables.md) describes.

## Syntax
**Round**( *Number*, *DecimalPlaces* )<br>**RoundDown**( *Number*, *DecimalPlaces* )<br>**RoundUp**( *Number*, *DecimalPlaces* )

* *Number* - Required. The number to round.
* *DecimalPlaces* - Required.  The number of places to the right of the decimal point to round to.  Use 0 to round to a whole number.
