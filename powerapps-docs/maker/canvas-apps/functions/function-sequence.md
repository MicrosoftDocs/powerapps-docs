# Sequence function in Power Apps
Generate a table of sequential numbers.

## Description
The **Sequence** function generates a single column table of sequential numbers, such as 1, 2, 3.  The name of the column is **Value**.  `Sequence( 4 )` is equivalent to `[1,2,3,4]`.

Use **Sequence** with the **ForAll** function to iterate a specific number of times.  For example, the following formula adds 10 random numbers to the collection **MyRandomNumbers**:

```powerapps-dot
ForAll( Sequence( 10 ), Collect( MyRandomNumbers, Rand() ) )
```

**ForAll** can also be used to transform the value into other data types and return a new table.  For example, the following formula returns a table of the next 10 days: 

```powerapps-dot
ForAll( Sequence( 10 ), DateAdd( Today(), Value, Days ) )
``` 

The number of records to generate is rounded down to the nearest whole number and must be in the range 0 to 50,000.  Generating a table with zero records results in an *empty* table.

> [!NOTE]
> **Sequence** is limited to 50,000 records.

## Syntax
**Sequence**( *Records* [, *Start* [, *Step* ] ] )

* *Records* – Required. The number of records to create.  Must be in the range 0 to 50,000.
* *Start* – Optional.  The starting number for the sequence.  Default is 1.
* *Step* – Optional.  The increment for each successive number in the sequence.  *Step* can be negative to count down from the *Start*.  Default is 1.

## Examples

### Basic usage

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sequence( 4 )** | Generates a 4 record table starting at the default 1 and incrementing by the default 1. | ![Sequence-4](media/function-sequence/sequence-4.png "Sequence-4") |
| **Sequence( 4, 24 )** | Generates a 4 record table starting at 24 and incrementing by the default 1. | ![Sequence-4-24](media/function-sequence/sequence-4-24.png "Sequence-4-24") |
| **Sequence( 4, 4, -1 )** | Generates a 4 record table starting at 4 and incrementing by -1, effectively counting backward. | ![Sequence-4-4-n1](media/function-sequence/sequence-4-4-n1.png "Sequence-4-4-n1") |
| **Sequence( 4, -100, 0.5 )** | Generates a 4 record table starting at -100 and incrementing by 0.5. | ![Sequence-4-n100-p5](media/function-sequence/sequence-4-n100-p5.png "Sequence-4-n100-p5") |
| **Sequence( 0.9 )** | Generates an *empty* table as the count rounds down to 0. | ![Sequence-empty](media/function-sequence/sequence-empty.png "Sequence-empty") | 
| **ForAll( Sequence( 4 ), Rand() )** | Generates a 4 record table of random numbers. | ![sequence-4-random](media/function-sequence/sequence-4-random.png "Sequence-4-random")<br>*Actual numbers will vary.* |
| **Concat( Sequence( 5 ),<br>Text( Value ) & " " )** | Generates a string of numbers from 1 to 5. | **"1 2 3 4 5 "** | 

### Character map

See the [**Char**](function-char.md#display-a-character-map) function reference for two **Sequence** functions working together to display a character map in a two-dimensional layout.

### Chessboard

See the [**As**](operators.md#as-operator) operator reference for two **Sequence** functions working together to create a chessboard in a text string and in two nested galleries.
