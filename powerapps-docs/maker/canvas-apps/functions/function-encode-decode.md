# EncodeUrl and PlainText functions in Power Apps
Encodes and decodes strings.

## Description
The **EncodeUrl** function encodes a URL string, replacing certain non-alphanumeric characters with % and a hexadecimal number.  

The **PlainText** function removes HTML and XML tags, converting certain tags such as these to an appropriate symbol:

* **&amp;nbsp;**
* **&amp;quot;**

The return value from these functions is the encoded or decoded string. This function doesn't remove all HTML and XML tags. 

## Syntax
**EncodeUrl**( *String* )

* *String* - Required.  URL to be encoded.

**PlainText**( *String* )

* *String* - Required. String from which HTML and XML tags will be stripped.

## Examples
If you show an RSS feed in a text gallery and then set the **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of a label in that gallery to **ThisItem.description**, the label might show raw HTML or XML code as in this example:

```html
    <p>We have done an unusually&nbsp;&quot;deep&quot; globalization and localization.</p>
```

If you set the **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the label to **PlainText(ThisItem.description)**, the text appears as in this example:

```
    We have done an unusually "deep" globalization and localization.
```
