# Calendar and Clock functions in Power Apps
Retrieves calendar and clock information about the current locale.

## Description
The **Calendar** and **Clock** functions are a set of functions that retrieve information about the current locale.

You can use these functions to display dates and times in the language of the current user.  The single-column tables returned by **Calendar** and **Clock** functions can be used directly with the **[Items](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of Dropdown and Listbox controls.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Calendar.MonthsLong()** |Single-column table containing the full names of each month, starting with "January". |
| **Calendar.MonthsShort()** |Single-column table containing the abbreviated names of each month, starting with "Jan" for January. |
| **Calendar.WeekdaysLong()** |Single-column table containing the full names of each weekday, starting with "Sunday". |
| **Calendar.WeekdaysShort()** |Single-column table containing the full names of each weekday, starting with "Sun" for Sunday. |
| **Clock.AmPm()** |Single-column table containing the long uppercase "AM" and "PM" designations.  If the language uses a 24-hour clock, the table will be empty. |
| **Clock.AmPmShort()** |Single-column table containing the short uppercase "A" and "P" designations.  If the language uses a 24-hour clock, the table will be empty. |
| **Clock.IsClock24()** |Boolean indicating if a 24-hour clock is used in this locale. |

Use the **[Text](function-text.md)** function to format date and time values using this same information.  The **[Language](function-language.md)** function returns the current language and region code.

## Syntax
**Calendar.MonthsLong**()

**Calendar.MonthsShort**()

**Calendar.WeekdaysLong**()

**Calendar.WeekdaysShort**()

**Clock.AmPm**()

**Clock.AmPmShort**()

**Clock.IsClock24**()

## Examples
1. Insert a Dropdown control.
2. Set the formula for the **[Items](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to:
   
   * **Calendar.MonthsLong()**
3. Users of your app can now select a month in their own language.  **MonthsLong** can be replaced with any of the single-column tables that are returned by **Calendar** to create weekday and time selectors.

In the United States, with **[Language](function-language.md)** returning "en-US", the following is returned by the **Calendar** functions:
