# If and Switch functions in Power Apps
Determines whether any condition in a set is true (**If**) or the result of a formula matches any value in a set (**Switch**) and then returns a result or executes an action.

## Description
The **If** function tests one or more conditions until a **true** result is found. If such a result is found, a corresponding value is returned. If no such result is found, a default value is returned. In either case, the returned value might be a string to show, a formula to evaluate, or another form of result.

The **Switch** function evaluates a formula and determines whether the result matches any value in a sequence that you specify. If a match is found, a corresponding value is returned. If no match is found, a default value is returned. In either case, the returned value might be a string to show, a formula to evaluate, or another form of result.

**If** and **Switch** are very similar, but you should use the best function for your situation:

* Use **If** to evaluate a single condition. The most common syntax for this function is **If**( *Condition*, *ThenResult*, *DefaultResult* ), which provides the common “if …  then … else …” pattern seen in other programming tools.
* Use **If** to evaluate multiple unrelated conditions. In Power Apps (unlike Microsoft Excel), you can specify multiple conditions without having to nest **If** formulas.
* Use **Switch** to evaluate a single condition against multiple possible matches. You can also use **If** in this case, but you'd need to repeat the formula for each possible match.

You can use both of these functions in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md) to branch between two or more actions. Only one branch will trigger an action. Conditions and matches are evaluated in order, and they stop if a condition is **true** or a match is found.

*Blank* is returned if no conditions are **true**, no matches are found, and you don't specify a default result.

## Syntax
**If**( *Condition*, *ThenResult* [, *DefaultResult* ] )<br>**If**( *Condition1*, *ThenResult1* [, *Condition2*, *ThenResult2*, ... [ , *DefaultResult* ] ] )

* *Condition(s)* - Required. Formula(s) to test for **true**. Such formulas commonly contain comparison [operators](operators.md) (such as **<**, **>**, and **=**) and test functions such as **[IsBlank](function-isblank-isempty.md)** and **[IsEmpty](function-isblank-isempty.md)**.
* *ThenResult(s)* - Required. The corresponding value to return for a condition that evaluates to **true**.
* *DefaultResult* - Optional. The value to return if no condition evaluates to **true**.  If you don't specify this argument, *blank* is returned.

**Switch**( *Formula*, *Match1*, *Result1* [, *Match2*, *Result2*, ... [, *DefaultResult* ] ] )

* *Formula* - Required. Formula to evaluate for matches.  This formula is evaluated only once.
* *Match(s)* - Required. Values to compare with the result from *Formula*.  If an exact match is found, the corresponding *Result* is returned.
* *Result(s)* - Required. The corresponding value to return when an exact match is found.
* *DefaultResult* - Optional. If an exact match isn't found, this value is returned. If you don't specify this argument, *blank* is returned.

## Examples
### Values in formulas
In the following examples, a **Slider** control (named **Slider1**) has a value of **25**.

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;=&nbsp;25, "Result1" )** |The condition is **true**, and the corresponding result is returned. |"Result1" |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;=&nbsp;25, "Result1", "Result2" )** |The condition is **true**, and the corresponding result is returned. |"Result1" |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;>&nbsp;1000, "Result1" )** |The condition is **false**, and no *DefaultResult* was provided. |*blank* |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;>&nbsp;1000, "Result1", "Result2" )** |The condition is **false**, a *DefaultResult* was provided, and it's returned. |"Result2" |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;=&nbsp;25, "Result1", Slider1.Value&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, "Result2" )** |The first condition is **true**, and the corresponding result is returned. The second condition is also **true**, but it isn't evaluated because it appears later in the argument list than a condition that evaluates to **true**. |"Result1" |
| **If( IsBlank(&nbsp;Slider1.Value&nbsp;), "Result1", IsNumeric(&nbsp;Slider1.Value&nbsp;), "Result2" )** |The first condition is **false** because the slider isn't *blank*. The second condition is **true** because the slider's value is a number, and the corresponding result is returned. |"Result2" |
| **If( Slider1.Value&nbsp;>&nbsp;1000, "Result1", Slider1.Value&nbsp;>&nbsp;50, "Result2", "Result3")** |Both the first and second conditions are **false**, a *DefaultResult* was provided, and it's returned. |"Result3" |
| **Switch( Slider1.Value, 25, "Result1" )** |The slider's value matches the first value to be checked, and the corresponding result is returned. |"Result1" |
| **Switch( Slider1.Value, 20, "Result1", 25, "Result2", 30, "Result3" )** |The slider's value matches the second value to be checked, and the corresponding result is returned. |"Result2" |
| **Switch( Slider1.Value, 20, "Result1", 10, "Result2", 0, "Result3", "DefaultResult" )** |The slider's value doesn't match any value to be checked.  A *DefaultResult* was provided, so it's returned. |"DefaultResult" |

### Branching in behavior formulas
In these examples, a **[Text input](../controls/control-text-input.md)** control named **FirstName** has the value "John" typed into it.

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **If( ! IsBlank( FirstName.Text ), Navigate(&nbsp;Screen1, ScreenTransition.None ) )** |The condition is **true**, so the **[Navigate](function-navigate.md)** function runs. You can use the **[IsBlank](function-isblank-isempty.md)** function to test whether a required form field has been filled in.  If **FirstName** were [blank](function-isblank-isempty.md), this formula would have no effect. |**true**<br><br>The display is changed to **Screen1**. |
| **If( IsBlank( FirstName.Text ), Navigate(&nbsp;Screen1, ScreenTransition.None ), Back() )** |Without the **!** operator, the condition is **false**, so the **[Navigate](function-navigate.md)** function doesn't run. The **[Back](function-navigate.md)** function was provided as a *DefaultResult*, so it runs. |**true**<br><br>The display goes back to the screen that was previously shown. |
| **Switch( FirstName.Text, "Carlos", Navigate(&nbsp;Screen1, ScreenTransition.None ), "Kirstin", Navigate( Screen2, ScreenTransition.None ), "John", Navigate( Screen3, ScreenTransition.None ) )** |The value of **FirstName.Text** is compared against "Carlos", "Kirstin", and "John" in that order. A match is found with "John", so the app navigates to **Screen3**. |**true**<br><br>The display is changed to **Screen3**. |

### Step by step
1. Add a **[Text input](../controls/control-text-input.md)** control, and name it **Text1** if it doesn't have that name by default.
2. In **Text1**, type **30**.
3. Add a **Label** control, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **If( Value(Text1.Text) < 20, "Order MANY more!", Value(Text1.Text) < 40, "Order more!", Text1.Text )**
   
    The **Label** control shows **Order more!** because the value of **Text1** is more than 20 but less than 40.
4. In **Text1**, type **15**.
   
    The **Label** control shows **Order MANY more!** because the value of **Text1** is less than 20.
5. In **Text1**, type **50**.
   
    The **Label** control shows the value that you typed because it's more than 40.
