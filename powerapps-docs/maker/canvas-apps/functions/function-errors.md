# Errors function in Power Apps
Provides error information for previous changes to a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md).

## Overview
Errors can happen when a [record](../working-with-tables.md#records) of a data source is changed.  Many causes are possible, including network outages, inadequate permissions, and edit conflicts.  

The **[Patch](function-patch.md)** function and other data functions don't directly return errors. Instead they return the result of their operation. After a data function executes, you can use the **Errors** function to obtain the details of any errors.  You can check for the existence of errors with the **[IsEmpty]** function in the formula **IsEmpty( Errors ( ... ) )**.

You can avoid some errors before they happen by using the **[Validate](function-validate.md)** and **[DataSourceInfo](function-datasourceinfo.md)** functions.  See [working with data sources](../working-with-data-sources.md) for more suggestions on how to work with and avoid errors.

## Description
The **Errors** function returns a [table](../working-with-tables.md) of errors that contains the following [columns](../working-with-tables.md#columns):

* **Record**.  The record in the data source that had the error.  If the error occurred during the creation of a record, this column will be *blank*.
* **Column**.  The column that caused the error, if the error can be attributed to a single column. If not, this will be *blank*.
* **Message**.  A description of the error.  This error string can be displayed for the end user.  Be aware that this message may be generated by the data source and could be long and contain raw column names that may not have any meaning to the user.
* **Error**.  An error code that can be used in formulas to help resolve the error:

| ErrorKind | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ErrorKind.Conflict |Another change was made to the same record, resulting in a change conflict.  Use the **[Refresh](function-refresh.md)** function to reload the record and try the change again. |
| ErrorKind.ConstraintViolation |One or more constraints have been violated. |
| ErrorKind.CreatePermission |An attempt was made to create a record, and the current user doesn't have permission to create records. |
| ErrorKind.DeletePermission |An attempt was made to delete a record, and the current user doesn't have permission to delete records. |
| ErrorKind.EditPermission |An attempt was made to edit a record, and the current user doesn't have permission to edit records. |
| ErrorKind.GeneratedValue |An attempt was made to change a column that the data source generates automatically. |
| ErrorKind.MissingRequired |The value for a required column is missing from the record. |
| ErrorKind.None |There is no error. |
| ErrorKind.NotFound |An attempt was made to edit or delete a record, but the record couldn't be found.  Another user may have changed the record. |
| ErrorKind.ReadOnlyValue |An attempt was made to change a column that's read only. |
| ErrorKind.Sync |An error was reported by the data source.  Check the Message column for more information. |
| ErrorKind.Unknown |There was an error, but of an unknown kind. |
| ErrorKind.Validation |There was a general validation issue detected, that did not fit one of the other kinds. |

Errors can be returned for the entire data source, or for only a selected row by providing the *Record* argument to the function.  

**[Patch](function-patch.md)** or another data function may return a *blank* value if, for example, a record couldn't be created. You can pass *blank* to **Errors**, and it will return appropriate error information in these cases.  Subsequent use of data functions on the same data source will clear this error information.

If there are no errors, the table that **Errors** returns will be [empty](function-isblank-isempty.md) and can be tested with the **[IsEmpty](function-isblank-isempty.md)** function.

## Syntax
**Errors**( *DataSource* [, *Record* ] )

* *DataSource* – Required. The data source for which you want to return errors.
* *Record* – Optional.  A specific record for which you want to return errors. If you don't specify this argument, the function returns errors for the entire data source.

## Examples
### Step by Step
For this example, we'll be working with the **IceCream** data source:

![Ice Cream.](media/function-errors/icecream.png "Ice Cream")

Through the app, a user loads the Chocolate record into a data-entry form and then changes the value of **Quantity** to 90.  The record to be worked with is placed in the [context variable](../working-with-variables.md#use-a-context-variable) **EditRecord**:

* **UpdateContext( { EditRecord: First( Filter( IceCream, Flavor = "Chocolate" ) ) } )**

To make this change in the data source, the **[Patch](function-patch.md)** function is used:

* **Patch( IceCream, EditRecord, Gallery.Updates )**

where **Gallery.Updates** evaluates to **{ Quantity: 90 }**, since only the **Quantity** property has been modified.

Unfortunately, just before the **[Patch](function-patch.md)** function was invoked, somebody else modifies the **Quantity** for Chocolate to 80.  Power Apps will detect this and not allow the conflicting change to occur.  You can check for this situation with the formula:

* **IsEmpty( Errors( IceCream, EditRecord ) )**

which returns **false**, because the **Errors** function returned the following table:

| Record | Column | Message | Error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| { Flavor: "Chocolate", Quantity: 100 } |*blank* |"Another user has modified the record that you're trying to modify. Please reload the record and try again." |ErrorKind.Conflict |

You can place a label on the form to show this error to the user.

* To show the error, set the label's **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
  **Label.Text = First(Errors( IceCream, EditRecord )).Message**

You can also add a **Reload** button on the form, so that the user can efficiently resolve the conflict.

* To show the button only when a conflict has occurred, set the button's **[Visible](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
    **!IsEmpty( Lookup( Errors( IceCream, EditRecord ), Error = ErrorKind.Conflict ) )**
* To revert the change which the user selects the button, set its **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
    **ReloadButton.OnSelect = Revert( IceCream, EditRecord )**
