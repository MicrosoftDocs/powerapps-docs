# Validate function in Power Apps
The **Validate** function checks whether the value of a single [column](../working-with-tables.md#columns) or a complete [record](../working-with-tables.md#records) is valid for a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md).  

## Description
Before a user submits a data change, you can provide immediate feedback on the validity of that submission, resulting in a better user experience.

Data sources can provide information on what constitutes valid values within a record. This information can include many constraints, such as these examples:

* whether a column requires a value
* how long a string of text can be
* how high and low a number can be
* how early and late a date can be

The **Validate** function uses this information to determine whether a value is valid and to return an appropriate error message if not. You can use the **[DataSourceInfo](function-datasourceinfo.md)** function to view the same information that **Validate** uses.

Data sources vary in how much validation information they provide, including not providing any at all. **Validate** can only verify values based on this information. Even if  **Validate** doesn't find a problem, applying the data change may still fail. You can use the **[Errors](function-errors.md)** function to obtain information about the failure.

If **Validate** finds a problem, the function returns an error message that you can show to the user of the app. If all values are valid, **Validate** returns [blank](function-isblank-isempty.md). When you work with a [collection](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections) that has no validation information, values are always valid.

## Syntax
**Validate**( *DataSource*, *Column*, *Value* )

* *DataSource* – Required. The data source to validate with.
* *Column* – Required. The column to validate.
* *Value* – Required. The value for the selected column to be validated.

**Validate**( *DataSource*, *OriginalRecord*, *Updates* )

* *DataSource* – Required. The data source to validate with.
* *OriginalRecord* - Required.  The record to which updates are to be validated.
* *Updates* - Required.  The changes to apply to the original record.

## Examples
For these examples, values in the **Percentage** column of the **Scores** data source must be between 0 and 100, inclusive. If the data passes validation, the function returns *blank*. Otherwise, the function returns an error message.

### Validate with a single column

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Validate( Scores, Percentage, 10 )** |Checks whether **10** is a valid value for the **Percentage** column in the **Scores** data source. |*blank* |
| **Validate( Scores, Percentage, 120 )** |Checks whether **120** is a valid value for the **Percentage** column in the **Scores** data source. |"Values must be between 0 and 100." |

### Validate with a complete record

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Validate( Scores, EditRecord, Gallery.Updates )** |Checks whether values in all columns are valid for the **Scores** data source. In this example, the value in the **Percentage** column is **10**. |*blank* |
| **Validate( Scores, EditRecord, Gallery.Updates )** | Checks whether values in all columns are valid for the **Scores** data source. In this example, the value in the **Percentage** column is **120**. |"Values must be between 0 and 100." |
