# Download function in Power Apps

Downloads a file from the web to the local device.

## Description

The **Download** function downloads a file from the web to the local device.

In native players (Windows, Android, and iOS), the user is prompted for a location to save the file.  

When used on the web, **Download** is dependent on the browser's settings to determine what happens with the file. For images, videos, and other file types that the browser natively supports, a new browser tab is opened to display the file.b Many browsers support saving the contents to the local file system.

Only on Windows, **Download** returns the location where the file was stored locally as a text string.

**Download** can only be used in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md).

## Syntax

**Download**( *Address* )

* *Address* â€“ Required.  The URL address of a web resource to download.

## Examples

### Simple Download

The following formula will download the user's guide for the Surface Book, a PDF file:

```powerapps-dot
Download( "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=827480" )
```

When run in a mobile device, the user will be prompted for a location to save the file.  

When run in most web browsers, a new tab will be opened to display the PDF file as most browsers natively support this file type.
