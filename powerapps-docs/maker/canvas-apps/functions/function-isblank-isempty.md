# Blank, Coalesce, IsBlank, and IsEmpty functions in Power Apps
Tests whether a value is blank or a [table](../working-with-tables.md) contains no [records](../working-with-tables.md#records), and provides a way to create *blank* values.

## Overview
*Blank* is a placeholder for "no value" or "unknown value."  For example, a **[Combo box](../controls/control-combo-box.md)** control's **Selected** property is *blank* if the user hasn't made a selection. Many data sources can store and return NULL values, which are represented in Power Apps as *blank*.

Any property or calculated value in Power Apps can be *blank*.  For example, a Boolean value normally has one of two values: **true** or **false**.  But in addition to these two, it can also be *blank* indicating that the state is not known.  This is similar to Microsoft Excel, where a worksheet cell starts out as blank with no contents but can hold the values **TRUE** or **FALSE** (among others). At any time, the contents of the cell can again be cleared, returning it to a *blank* state.

*Empty string* refers to a string that contains no characters.  The [**Len** function](function-len.md) returns zero for such a string and it can be written in a formulas as  two double quotes with nothing in between `""`.  Some controls and data sources use an empty string to indicate a "no value" condition.  To simplify app creation, the **IsBlank** and **Coalesce** functions test for both *blank* values or empty strings.    

In the context of the **IsEmpty** function, *empty* is specific to tables that contain no records. The table structure may be intact, complete with [column](../working-with-tables.md#columns) names, but no data is in the table. A table may start as empty, take on records and no longer be empty, and then have the records removed and again be empty.

> [!NOTE]
> We are in a period of transition.  Until now, *blank* has also been used to report errors, making it impossible to differentiate a valid "no value" from an error.  For this reason, at this time, storing *blank* values is supported only for local collections.  You can store *blank* values in other data sources if you turn on the "Formula-level error management" experimental feature under the File menu, App settings, Advanced settings, Experimental features.  We are actively working to finish this feature and complete the proper separation of *blank* values from errors.

## Description
The **Blank** function returns a *blank* value. Use this to store a NULL value in a data source that supports these values, effectively removing any value from the field.

The **IsBlank** function tests for a *blank* value or an empty string.  The test includes empty strings to ease app creation since some data sources and controls use an empty string when there is no value present.  To test specifically for a *blank* value use `if( Value = Blank(), ...` instead of **IsBlank**.

The **Coalesce** function evaluates its arguments in order and returns the first value that isn't *blank* or an empty string.  Use this function to replace a *blank* value or empty string with a different value but leave non-*blank* and non-empty string values unchanged.  If all of the arguments are *blank* or empty strings then the function returns *blank*, making **Coalesce** a good way to convert empty strings to *blank* values.  All arguments to **Coalesce** must be of the same type; for example, you can't mix numbers with text strings.  

`Coalesce( value1, value2 )` is the more concise equivalent of `If( Not IsBlank( value1 ), value1, Not IsBlank( value2 ), value2 )` and doesn't require **value1** and **value2** to be evaluated twice.  The [**If** function](function-if.md) returns *blank* if there is no "else" formula as is the case here.

The **IsEmpty** function tests whether a table contains any records. It's equivalent to using the **[CountRows](function-table-counts.md)** function and checking for zero. You can check for data-source errors by combining **IsEmpty** with the **[Errors](function-errors.md)** function.

The return value for both **IsBlank** and **IsEmpty** is a Boolean **true** or **false**.

## Syntax
**Blank**()

**Coalesce**( *Value1* [, *Value2*, ... ] )

* *Value(s)* – Required. Values to test.  Each value is evaluated in order until a value that is not *blank* and not an empty string is found.  Values after this point are not evaluated.  

**IsBlank**( *Value* )

* *Value* – Required. Value to test for a *blank* value or empty string.

**IsEmpty**( *Table* )

* *Table* - Required. Table to test for records.

## Examples
### Blank
> [!NOTE]
> At this time, the following example only works for local collections.  You can store *blank* values in other data sources if you turn on the "Formula-level error management" experimental feature under the File menu, App settings, Advanced settings, Experimental features.  We are actively working to finish this feature and complete the separation of *blank* values from errors.

1. Create an app from scratch, and add a **Button** control.
2. Set the button's **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    ClearCollect( Cities, { Name: "Seattle", Weather: "Rainy" } )
    ```
3. Preview your app, click or tap the button that you added, and then close Preview.  
4. On the **File** menu, click or tap **Collections**.

     The **Cities** collection appears, showing one record with "Seattle" and "Rainy":

    ![Collection showing Seattle with Rainy weather](./media/function-isblank-isempty/seattle-rainy.png)
5. Click or tap the back arrow to return to the default workspace.
6. Add a **Label** control, and set its **Text** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    IsBlank( First( Cities ).Weather )
    ```

    The label shows **false** because the **Weather** field contains a value ("Rainy").
7. Add a second button, and set its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Patch( Cities, First( Cities ), { Weather: Blank() } )
    ```
8. Preview your app, click or tap the button that you added, and then close Preview.  

    The **Weather** field of the first record in **Cities** is replaced with a *blank*, removing the "Rainy" that was there previously.

    ![Collection showing Seattle with a blank Weather field](./media/function-isblank-isempty/seattle-blank.png)

    The label shows **true** because the **Weather** field no longer contains a value.

### Coalesce

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coalesce(&nbsp;Blank(),&nbsp;1&nbsp;)** |Tests the return value from the **Blank** function, which always returns a *blank* value. Because the first argument is *blank*, evaluation continues with the next argument until a non-*blank* value and non-empty string is found. |**1** |
| **Coalesce( "", 2 )** |Tests the first argument which is an empty string. Because the first argument is an empty string, evaluation continues with the next argument until a non-*blank* value and non-empty string is found. |**2** |
| **Coalesce( Blank(), "", Blank(), "", 3, 4 )** |**Coalesce** starts at the beginning of the argument list and evaluates each argument in turn until a non-*blank* value and non-empty string is found.  In this case, the first four arguments all return *blank* or an empty string, so evaluation continues to the fifth argument. The fifth argument is non-*blank* and non-empty string, so evaluation stops here. The value of the fifth argument is returned, and the sixth argument isn't evaluated. |**3** |
| **Coalesce( "" )** | Tests the first argument which is an empty string. Because the first argument is an empty string, and there are no more arguments, the function returns *blank*.   |*blank* |

### IsBlank
1. Create an app from scratch, add a text-input control, and name it **FirstName**.
2. Add a label, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If( IsBlank( FirstName.Text ), "First Name is a required field." )
    ```

    By default, the **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of a text-input control is set to **"Text input"**. Because the property contains a value, it isn't blank, and the label doesn't display any message.
3. Remove all the characters from the text-input control, including any spaces.

    Because the **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property no longer contains any characters, it's an empty string, and **IsBlank( FirstName.Text )** will be **true**. The required field message is displayed.

For information about how to perform validation by using other tools, see the **[Validate](function-validate.md)** function and [working with data sources](../working-with-data-sources.md).  

Other examples:

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IsBlank(&nbsp;Blank()&nbsp;)** |Tests the return value from the **Blank** function, which always returns a *blank* value. |**true** |
| **IsBlank( "" )** |A string that contains no characters. |**true** |
| **IsBlank( "Hello" )** |A string that contains one or more characters. |**false** |
| **IsBlank( *AnyCollection* )** |Because the [collection](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections) exists, it isn't blank, even if it doesn't contain any records. To check for an empty collection, use **IsEmpty** instead. |**false** |
| **IsBlank( Mid( "Hello", 17, 2 ) )** |The starting character for **[Mid](function-left-mid-right.md)** is beyond the end of the string.  The result is an empty string. |**true** |
| **IsBlank( If( false, false ) )** |An **[If](function-if.md)** function with no *ElseResult*.  Because the condition is always **false**, this **[If](function-if.md)** always returns *blank*. |**true** |

### IsEmpty
1. Create an app from scratch, and add a **Button** control.
2. Set the button's **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    **Collect( IceCream, { Flavor: "Strawberry", Quantity: 300 }, { Flavor: "Chocolate", Quantity: 100 } )**
3. Preview your app, click or tap the button that you added, and then close Preview.  

    A collection named **IceCream** is created and contains this data:

    ![](media/function-isblank-isempty/icecream-strawberry-chocolate.png)

    This collection has two records and isn't empty. **IsEmpty( IceCream )** returns **false**, and **CountRows( IceCream )** returns **2**.
4. Add a second button, and set its **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    **Clear( IceCream )**
5. Preview your app, click or tap the second button, and then close Preview.  

    The collection is now empty:

    ![](media/function-isblank-isempty/icecream-clear.png)

    The **[Clear](function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function removes all the records from a collection, resulting in an empty collection. **IsEmpty( IceCream )** returns **true**, and **CountRows( IceCream )** returns **0**.

You can also use **IsEmpty** to test whether a calculated table is empty, as these examples show:

| Formula | Description | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IsEmpty( [&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3 ] )** |The single-column table contains three records and, therefore, isn't empty. |**false** |
| **IsEmpty( [&nbsp;] )** |The single-column table contains no records and is empty. |**true** |
| **IsEmpty( Filter( [&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3&nbsp;], Value > 5 ) )** |The single-column table contains no values that are greater than 5.  The result from the filter doesn't contain any records and is empty. |**true** |
