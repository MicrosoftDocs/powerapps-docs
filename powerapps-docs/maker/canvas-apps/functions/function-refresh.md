# Refresh function in Power Apps
Refreshes the [records](../working-with-tables.md#records) of a [data source](../working-with-data-sources.md).

## Description
The **Refresh** function retrieves a fresh copy of a data source.  You'll see changes that other users made.

**Refresh** has no return value, and you can use it only in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md).

## Syntax
**Refresh**( *DataSource* )

* *DataSource* â€“ Required. The data source that you want to refresh.

## Example
In this example, you'll refresh the data source named **IceCream**, which starts with this data:

![IceCream example.](media/function-refresh/icecream.png)

A user on another device changes the **Quantity** in the **Strawberry** record to **400**.  You won't see this change until this formula executes:

**Refresh( IceCream )**

After that formula executes, galleries that are bound to the **IceCream** data source will show the updated value for **Strawberry**:

![IceCream after refresh.](media/function-refresh/icecream-after.png)
