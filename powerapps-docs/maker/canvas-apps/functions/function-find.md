# Find function in Power Apps
Finds a string of text, if it exists, within another string.

## Description
The **Find** function looks for a string within another string and is case sensitive. To ignore case, first use the **[Lower](function-lower-upper-proper.md)** function on the arguments.

**Find** returns the starting position of the string that was found.  Position 1 is the first character of the string. **Find** returns *blank* if the string in which you're searching doesn't contain the string for which you're searching.

## Syntax
**Find**( *FindString*, *WithinString* [, *StartingPosition* ] )

* *FindString* - Required.  The string to find.
* *WithinString* - Required.  The string to search within.
* *StartingPosition* - Optional.  The starting position to start searching.  Position 1 is the first character.
