# GroupBy and Ungroup functions in Power Apps
Groups and ungroups [records](../working-with-tables.md#records) of a [table](../working-with-tables.md).

## Description
The **GroupBy** function returns a table with records grouped together based on the values in one or more [columns](../working-with-tables.md#columns). Records in the same group are placed into a single record, with a column added that holds a nested table of the remaining columns.   

The **Ungroup** function reverses the **GroupBy** process. This function returns a table, breaking into separate records any records that were grouped together.

You can group records by using **GroupBy**, modify the table that it returns, and then ungroup records in the modified table by using **Ungroup**. For example, you can remove a group of records by following this approach:

* Use the **GroupBy** function.
* Use the **[Filter](function-filter-lookup.md)** function to remove the entire group of records.
* Use the **Ungroup** function.  

You can also aggregate results based on a grouping:

* Use the **GroupBy** function.
* Use the **[AddColumns](function-table-shaping.md)** function with **[Sum](function-aggregates.md)**, **[Average](function-aggregates.md)**, and other aggregate functions to add a new column which is an aggregate of the group tables.
* Use the **[DropColumns](function-table-shaping.md)** function to drop the group table.

**Ungroup** tries to preserve the original order of the records that were fed to **GroupBy**.  This isn't always possible (for example, if the original table contains *blank* records).

A table is a value in Power Apps, just like a string or a number. You can specify a table as an argument for a function, and a function can return a table. **GroupBy** and **Ungroup** don't modify a table; instead they take a table as an argument and return a different table. See [working with tables](../working-with-tables.md) for more details.

## Syntax
**GroupBy**( *Table*, *ColumnName1* [, *ColumnName2*, ... ], *GroupColumnName* )

* *Table* - Required. Table to be grouped.
* *ColumnName(s)* - Required.  The column names in *Table* by which to group records.  These columns become columns in the resulting table.
* *GroupColumnName* - Required.  The column name for the storage of record data not in the *ColumnName(s)*.
  
    > [!NOTE]
  > For SharePoint and Excel data sources that contain column names with spaces, specify each space as **"\_x0020\_"**. For example, specify **"Column Name"** as **"Column_x0020_Name"**.

**Ungroup**( *Table*, *GroupColumnName* )

* *Table* - Required. Table to be ungrouped.
* *GroupColumnName* - Required. The column that contains the record data setup with the **GroupBy** function.
  
    > [!NOTE]
  > For SharePoint and Excel data sources that contain column names with spaces, specify each space as **"\_x0020\_"**. For example, specify **"Column Name"** as **"Column_x0020_Name"**.

## Examples
### Create a collection
1. Add a button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property so that the button shows **Original**.
2. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the **Original** button to this formula:

```powerapps-dot   
ClearCollect( CityPopulations, 
    { City: "London",    Country: "United Kingdom", Population: 8615000}, 
    { City: "Berlin",    Country: "Germany",        Population: 3562000}, 
    { City: "Madrid",    Country: "Spain",          Population: 3165000}, 
    { City: "Rome",      Country: "Italy",          Population: 2874000}, 
    { City: "Paris",     Country: "France",         Population: 2273000}, 
    { City: "Hamburg",   Country: "Germany",        Population: 1760000}, 
    { City: "Barcelona", Country: "Spain",          Population: 1602000}, 
    { City: "Munich",    Country: "Germany",        Population: 1494000}, 
    { City: "Milan",     Country: "Italy",          Population: 1344000}
)
```

3. While holding down the Alt key, select the **Original** button.
   
    You just created a [collection](../working-with-data-sources.md#collections), named **CityPopulations**, that contains this data:
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities.png)
4. To display this collection, select **Collections** on the **File** menu and then select the **CityPopulations** collection.  The first five records in the collection appear:
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/citypopulations-collection.png)

### Group records
1. Add another button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property to **"Group"**.
2. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of this button to this formula:
   
    **ClearCollect( CitiesByCountry, GroupBy( CityPopulations, "Country", "Cities" ) )**
3. While holding down the Alt key, select the **Group** button.
   
    You just created a collection, named **CitiesByCountry**, in which the records of the previous collection are grouped by the **Country** column.
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities-grouped.png)
4. To display the first five records in this collection, select **Collections** on the **File** menu.
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/citiesbycountry-collection.png)
5. To display the populations of cities in a country, select the table icon in the **Cities** column for that country (for example, Germany):
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/population-germany.png)

### Filter and ungroup records
1. Add another button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property so that the button shows **"Filter"**.
2. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of this button to this formula:
   
    **ClearCollect( CitiesByCountryFiltered, Filter( CitiesByCountry, "e" in Country ) )**
3. While holding down the Alt key, select the button that you added.
   
    You just created a third collection, named **CitiesByCountryFiltered**, that includes only those countries that have an "e" in their names (that is, not Spain or Italy).
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities-grouped-hase.png)
4. Add one more button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property so that the button shows **"Ungroup"**.
5. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of this button to this formula:
   
    **ClearCollect( CityPopulationsUngrouped, Ungroup( CitiesByCountryFiltered, "Cities" ) )**
   
    Which results in:
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities-hase.png)

### Aggregate results
Something else we can do with a grouped table is to aggregate the results.  In this example, we will sum the population of the major cities in each country.

1. Add another button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property so that the button shows **"Sum"**.
2. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the **"Sum"** button to this formula:
   
    **ClearCollect( CityPopulationsSum, AddColumns( CitiesByCountry, "Sum of City Populations", Sum( Cities, Population ) ) )**
   
    Which results in:
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities-sum.png)
   
    **[AddColumns](function-table-shaping.md)** starts with the base **CitiesByCountry** collection and adds a new column **Sum of City Populations**.  This column's values are calculated row-by-row, based on the formula **Sum( Cities, Population )**.  **AddColumns** provides the value of the **Cities** column (a table) for each row, and **[Sum](function-aggregates.md)** adds up the **Population** for each row of this sub table.

    Now that we have the sum that we want, we can use **[DropColumns](function-table-shaping.md)** to remove the sub tables.
  
3. Add another button, and set its **[Text](../controls/properties-core.md)** property so that the button shows **"SumOnly"**.
4. Set the **[OnSelect](../controls/properties-core.md)** property of the **"SumOnly"** button to this formula:

    **ClearCollect( CityPopulationsSumOnly, DropColumns( CityPopulationsSum, "Cities" ) )**
   
    Which results in:
   
    ![](media/function-groupby/cities-sum-drop-cities.png)
   
    Note that we didn't need to ungroup this table.
