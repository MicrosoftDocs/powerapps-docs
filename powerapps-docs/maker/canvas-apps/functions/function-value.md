# Value function in Power Apps
Converts a string of text to a number.

## Description
The **Value** function converts a string of text that contains number characters to a number value. Use this function when you need to perform calculations on numbers that were entered as text by a user.

Different languages interpret **,** and **.** differently.  By default, the text is interpreted in the language of the current user.  You can specify the language to use with a language tag, using the same language tags that are returned by the **[Language](function-language.md)** function.

Notes on the format of the string:

* The string may be prefixed with the currency symbol for the current language.  The currency symbol is ignored.  Currency symbols for other languages are not ignored.
* The string may be include a percent sign (**%**) at the end, indicating that it is a percentage.  The number will be divided by 100 before being returned.  Percentages and currency symbols cannot be mixed.
* The string may be in scientific notation, with 12 x 10<sup>3</sup> expressed as "12e3".

If the number is not in a proper format, **Value** will return *blank*.

To convert date and time values, use the [**DateValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md), [**TimeValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md), or [**DateTimeValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md) functions.

## Syntax
**Value**( *String* [, *LanguageTag* ] )

* *String* - Required. String to convert to a numeric value.
* *LanguageTag* - Optional.  The language tag in which to parse the string.  If not specified, the language of the current user is used.

## Examples
The user running these formulas is located in the United States and has selected English as their language.  The **Language** function is returning "en-US".
