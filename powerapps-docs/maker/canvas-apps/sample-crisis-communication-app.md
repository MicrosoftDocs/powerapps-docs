# Set up and learn about the Crisis Communication sample template in Power Apps

Step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the Crisis Communication app for Power Apps.

Estimated time to complete these steps: **20-25 minutes**

## Overview of the app

The *Crisis Communication* app provides a user-friendly experience to connect
end users with information about a crisis. Quickly get updates on
internal company news, get answers to frequently asked questions, and get access
to important information like links and emergency contacts. This app requires a
small amount of setup to make it your own.

In this walk through, you'll learn how to:
- Create a location for your data
- Import both the Crisis Communication app and its admin app
- Create content for the app
- Import flows to send notifications to users
- Create a centrally managed Teams team to aggregate data and to effectively respond to issues

## Prerequisites

- [Sign
    up](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) for
    Power Apps.
- You must have a valid SharePoint Online license and permission to create lists.
- You must have a public SharePoint site where you can store the data for the app.
- Download the assets from [aka.ms/CrisisCommunicationSolution](https://aka.ms/CrisisCommunicationSolution).

## Create a home for your data

The data for the app will live in SharePoint lists. We'll first need to create new SharePoint site to get started.

### Create a SharePoint site

1. Sign in to [Office online](https://www.office.com) and select **SharePoint**.
1. Select Create site and select next:

    ![Sample SharePoint site](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/01-Create-Site.png)

1. Select Team site:

    ![Team site](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/02-Team-Site.png)

1. Give your site a Name and Description.
1. Set the Privacy settings to public so that everyone in the company can get the necessary information:

    ![Site settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/03-Privacy-Settings.png)

1. Select Next.
1. Optionally add additional owners.
1. Select Finish.

### Create the SharePoint lists for app
The app requires multiple lists that store all the data. To automate the
creation of the SharePoint lists, you can use the *DeploySPLists* flow available from the downloaded [assets package](#prerequisites).

#### Import the SharePoint list deployment flow
1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
1. Select **My flows** from the left navigation.
1. Select the **Import** button in the command bar.
1. Upload the **DeploySPList.zip** package from the GitHub repository.

    ![Import package](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/import-package.png)

1. Add a SharePoint connection for the new Flow by selecting the **Select during import** link and completing the form.

    ![Import settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/import-settings.png)

1. If you need to create a new SharePoint connection, start by selecting
 **Create new** in the import setup pane.
1. Select **New connection** in the command bar:

    ![Create a new connection](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/create-connection.png)

1. Search for the name of the connection, for example *SharePoint*.
1. Select the appropriate connection.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Import**.

#### Edit the SharePoint list deployment flow

1. Once the import is done, go back to **My flows** and refresh the list of
    Flows
1. Select the newly imported flow **DeploySPList**.
1. Select **Edit** from the command bar.
1. Open the card called **Variable – Target Site for Lists**.
1. Change the value to the name of your SharePoint site.
1. Open the card called **Variable – App name**.
1. Change the value to the name of your app; by default, it is "Crisis Communication".

    ![Flow parameters](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/04-Flow-Settings.png)

1. Select **Save** to commit your changes.

#### Run the SharePoint list deployment flow

1. Go back to the detail screen for the **DeploySPList flow.**
1. Select **Run** from the command bar.
1. Select **Continue** to and then **Run flow** to trigger the flow.

    ![Sign in to run the flow](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/sign-in-flow.png)

    ![Run the flow](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/run-flow.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You may receive an error stating that location services are required.
  If this happens, please allow location services to Power Automate and refresh the page before trying again.

The flow will then create the following SharePoint lists within your SharePoint site:

| **Display Title**| **Purpose** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| CI_LogosAssets| To hold logo, and/or other images to be referenced from the app. The logo will be referenced in Power Apps by a direct link or via the ID number of the desired Logo. | Library for related logo(s) and other image assets for the [App Name] app. |
| CI_configAdminSetup | For feature configuration by the Admin of the tool. **Note**: This list should be read only to all members who are not admins. | Admin configuration list for the [App Name] app.
| CI_Contacts | Using the default Contacts Content type to capture information about contacts. (No people picker included – so may require maintenance to ensure data is up to date.)  **Note**: This depends on the global contact list type as a default content type in the list. | Contacts List for the [App Name] app.|
| CI_CompanyNews | Collection of Company News Items. | List for the management of news items visible in the [App Name] app. The Deprecated column can be used to filter news items out of the app (retaining them as a record). | 
| CI_FAQ  | Frequently asked questions. | Frequently Asked Questions for the [App Name] app. The Deprecated column can be used to filter FAQ items out of the app (retaining them as a record). |
| CI_UsefullLinks | Useful hyperlinks list | Useful hyperlinks list for the [App Name] app. The Deprecated column can be used to filter hyperlink items out of the app (retaining them as a record). |
| CI_Employee | Tracking current employee presence status. Examples: *working from home*; *out sick*; *on personal leave*; and *out on vacation*.  **Note**: *coming to work* is assumed and not included in the list options. | Useful hyperlinks list for the [App Name] app. The Deprecated column can be used to filter links items out of the app (retaining them as a record). |
| CI_HelpfulTips             | Users may contribute helpful tips to peers. | List for the management of shared tips for the [App Name] App. The Deprecated column can be used to remove tips from the app views (retaining them as a record in SPO).  |

> [!NOTE]
> - All list columns listed above should be considered as dependencies.
    Please protect the lists from accidental schema changes (for example, adding
    new columns is allowed, but deleting columns may break the app.)
> - Use caution when deleting list items; deleting list items deletes historical records. You can toggle deprecation value from *No* to *Yes* to drop records from contacts, news, FAQs or links.

## Import and set up the Crisis Communication app

Now that all the SharePoint lists are created, you can now import the app and
connect it to your new data sources.

  settings within the admin app.

## Monitor office absences with Power BI

Once you have the app deployed and people start to notify that they will be out of the office for various reasons (such
as being sick or working from home) you can now use a Power BI report to track how many and where those people are located.

To start, you can use the sample report 'Presence status report.pbix' available from the downloaded [assets package](#prerequisites).
If needed, download [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads). We will also need some information from
the **CI_Employee Status** SharePoint list created before, so let's get to it first. Open the list in your site and select List
Settings under the settings icon:

![Employee Status List Settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/001-SharePointList-ListSettings-nolines.PNG)

Take a note of the **site name** and the **list id** on the browser address bar:

![Employee Status List and Site Id](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/002-SharePointList-AddressAndId-nolines.PNG)

At this point, we are ready to open the Power BI report; launch Power BI and open the **Presence status report.pbix**
file. Move the mouse over the right side of the **CI_Employee Status** data source until you see the ellipsis, select
it and select the 'Edit query' option:

![Edit Query](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/003-PowerBI-EditQuery-nolines.PNG)

Once the Power Query editor is opened, right-click the **CI_Employee Status** data source, and select the **Advanced Editor**:

![Power Query Advanced Editor](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/004-PowerQuery-AdvancedEditor-nolines.PNG)

Here is where we will use the site name and list id from the SharePoint list: copy the new SharePoint site in the
table, and the list id in the three places where we have a GUID as highlighted, and select **Done**.

![Power Query Advanced Editor Updates](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/005-PowerQuery-AdvancedEditorUpdates-nolines.PNG)

Select **Close & Apply** to update the report to pull data from your SharePoint list.

![Power Query Close and Apply](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/006-PowerQuery-CloseAndApply-nolines.PNG)

We now have a Power BI report that shows both the geographical information for office absences for the current day, and
a trend of such absences over many days. We can now publish the report so other people in the organization can see it.

![Power BI Publish Report](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/007-PowerBI-Publish-nolines.PNG)

## Integrate your app into Teams

Now that you have a functioning app that has been shared with everyone, you can deploy the app using Teams and create
a crisis management team within Microsoft Teams to respond to issues.

### Deploy the app to the app bar
