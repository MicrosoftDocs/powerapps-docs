# Set up and learn about the Crisis Communication sample app in Power Apps

The Crisis Communication sample app provides a user-friendly experience to connect
users with information about a crisis. Quickly get updates on
internal company news, get answers to frequently asked questions, and get access
to important information like links and emergency contacts. This app requires a
small amount of setup to make it your own.

In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:

- Create a location for your data.
- Import both the Crisis Communication app and its admin app.
- Create content for the app.
- Import flows to send notifications to users.
- Create a centrally managed Teams team to aggregate data and to effectively respond to issues.

Estimated time to complete these steps: **20&ndash;25 minutes**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Crisis Communication sample app is also available for the Power Apps US Government and Power Automate US Government plans. The service URLs for Power Apps and Power Automate US Government versions are different from the commercial versions. More information: [Power Apps US Government service URLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-us-government#power-apps-us-government-service-urls) and [Power Automate US Government service URLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/us-govt#power-automate-us-government-service-urls)

## Create a home for your data

Data for the app is stored in SharePoint lists, so the first step is to create a new SharePoint site.

### Create a SharePoint site

1. Sign in to [Office online](https://www.office.com), and then select **SharePoint**.
1. Select **Create site**.

    ![Sample SharePoint site](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/01-Create-Site.png)

1. Select **Next**.
1. Add additional owners for the site (optional).
1. Select **Finish**.

### Create SharePoint lists for the app

The app uses multiple lists to store its data. You can use the DeploySPLists flow, available from the downloaded [assets package](#prerequisites), to automatically create these lists.

#### Import the SharePoint list deployment flow

1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com).
1. Select **My flows** from the left navigation pane.
1. Select **Import** on the command bar.
1. Upload the **DeploySPLists.zip** package from the GitHub repository.

    ![Import package](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/import-package.png)

1. Add a SharePoint connection for the new flow by selecting the **Select during import** link and completing the form.

    ![Import settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/import-settings.png)

1. If you need to create a new SharePoint connection, select
 **Create new** in the **Import setup** pane.
1. Select **New connection** on the command bar.

    ![Create a new connection](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/create-connection.png)

1. Search for the name of the connection, for example *SharePoint*.
1. Select the connection you created.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Import**.

#### Edit the SharePoint list deployment flow

1. After the import is done, go to **My flows** and refresh the list of flows.
1. Select the newly imported flow, **DeploySPLists**.
1. Select **Edit** on the command bar.
1. Open the **Variable – Target Site for Lists** card.
1. For **Value**, enter the name of your SharePoint site.
1. Open the **Variable – App name** card.
1. For **Value**, enter the name of your app; by default, the name is **Crisis Communication**.

    ![Flow parameters](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/04-Flow-Settings.png)

1. Select **Save**.

#### Run the SharePoint list deployment flow

1. Go back to the detail screen for the **DeploySPLists** flow.
1. Select **Run** on the command bar.
1. Select **Continue**, and then select **Run flow**.

    ![Sign in to run the flow](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/sign-in-flow.png)

    ![Run the flow](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/run-flow.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You might receive an error stating that location services are required.
  If this occurs, allow location services to access Power Automate and refresh the page before trying again.

The flow creates the following SharePoint lists in your SharePoint site.

| **Display title**| **Purpose** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| CI_LogosAssets| To hold the logo and/or other images to be referenced from the app. The logo will be referenced in Power Apps by a direct link or via the ID number of the logo you want to use. | The library for related logos and other image assets for the *[App Name]* app. |
| CI_configAdminSetup | Used for feature configuration by the admin of the app.<br>**Note**: This list should be read-only for all members who aren't admins. | Admin configuration list for the *[App Name]* app.
| CI_Contacts | Using the default Contacts Content type to capture information about contacts. (No people picker is included, so this list might need to be manually maintained to ensure its data is up to date.)<br>**Note**: This depends on the global contact list type's being a default content type in the list. | The contacts list for the *[App Name]* app.|
| CI_CompanyNews | Collection of **Company News** items. | A list for managing the news items that appear in the *[App Name]* app. You can use the **Deprecated** column to remove news items from the app views, while retaining them as a record. | 
| CI_FAQ  | Frequently asked questions. | The list of frequently asked questions for the *[App Name]* app. You can use the **Deprecated** column to remove FAQ items from the app views, while retaining them as a record. |
| CI_UsefulLinks | Useful hyperlinks list. | The list of useful hyperlinks for the *[App Name]* app. You can use the **Deprecated** column to remove hyperlink items from the app views, while retaining them as a record. |
| CI_Employee | Tracking current employee presence status. Examples: **working from home**, **out sick**, **on personal leave**, and **out on vacation**.  **Note**: The status **coming to work** is assumed and not included in the list options. | The list of messages that indicate the status of an employee's presence for the *[App Name]* app. You can use the **Deprecated** column to remove status messages from the app views, while retaining them as a record. |
| CI_HelpfulTips             | Helpful tips that users have contributed for their peers. | List for the management of shared tips for the *[App Name]* App. You can use the **Deprecated** column to remove tips from the app views, while retaining them as a record.  |

> [!NOTE]
> - All these list columns should be considered as dependencies.
    Protect the lists from accidental schema changes (for example, adding
    new columns is allowed, but deleting columns might break the app.)
> - Use caution when deleting list items; deleting list items deletes historical records. You can turn the deprecation value toggle from **No** to **Yes** to drop records from contacts, news, FAQs, or links.

## Import and set up the Crisis Communication app

After all SharePoint lists have been created, you can import the app and connect it to your new data sources.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to use the admin app, you can edit these same properties by editing the SharePoint lists manually.

### Import the app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select **Apps** from the left navigation pane.
1. Select **Import** on the command bar.

    Set(varEndDate,First(Sort(submittedDates,Date,Descending)).Date);
    // Create a new record for work status for each date selected in the date range.
    ForAll(
        Filter(
            RenameColumns(submittedDates,"Date","DisplayDate"),
            ComponentId=CalendarComponent.Id,
            !(DisplayDate in colDates.Date)
        ),
        Patch('CI_Employee Status',Defaults('CI_Employee Status'),
            {
                Title: varUser.userPrincipalName,

                // To implement location, add a comma to the line above and uncomment the lines below for latitude and longitude.
                // Latitude: Text(Location.Latitude),
                // Longitude: Text(Location.Longitude)
            }
        )
    );
        // Update existing dates with the new status.
        ForAll(
            AddColumns(
                Filter(
                    RenameColumns(submittedDates,"Date","DisplayDate"),
                    ComponentId=CalendarComponent.Id,
                    DisplayDate in colDates.Date
                ),
                
                // Get the current record for each existing date.
                "LookUpId",LookUp(RenameColumns(colDates,"ID","DateId"),And(Title=varUser.userPrincipalName,Date=DisplayDate)).DateId
            ),
            Patch('CI_Employee Status',LookUp('CI_Employee Status',ID=LookUpId),
                {

                }
            )
        );
        If(
            IsEmpty(Errors('CI_Employee Status')),
            
            // Update the list of work status for the logged-in user.

            // Send an email receipt to the logged-in user.
            UpdateContext(
                {
                    locReceiptSuccess: 
                    Office365Outlook.SendEmailV2(
                        // To: send an email to oneself
                        varUser.mail,
                        // Subject
                        Proper(WorkStatusComponent.Selected.Value) & ": " & varStartDate & If(varStartDate<>varEndDate," - " & varEndDate),
                        // Body

                        // Create a bulleted list of dates
                        "<ul>" & 
                            Concat(submittedDates,"<li>" & Date & Char(10)) &
                        "</ul>"
                    )
                }
            );
            If(
                locReceiptSuccess,
                Notify("You successfully submitted your work status. An email has been sent to you with a summary.",NotificationType.Success,3000),
                Notify("There was an error sending an email summary, but you successfully submitted your work status.",NotificationType.Success,3000);
            );
            
            Navigate('Share to Team Screen',LookUp(colStyles,Key="navigation_transition").Value),
            
            // Case: Error submitting work status

In the admin app, change the app URL to the following, where `App ID` is the ID of your app.

    ```
    https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<APP ID>/<APP ID>
    ```

    ![Admin app](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/42-admin-app.png)

    concat(items('Apply_to_each')?['AppUrl'], if(greater(indexOf(items('Apply_to_each')?['AppUrl'], '?'),0),'&','?'), 'context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22',triggerBody()?['ID'],'%22%7D')
    ```
    ![Change flow settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/43-flow-settings.png)

1. Update the canvas app to consume the teams context variable to deep link to the correct news article. <br> For the **OnStart** property of the app, change the Param from `newsid` to `subEntityId`.

    ![Change OnStart](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/44-onstart.png)

### Test the news notification flow

To test the news notification flow, go to the admin app and create a new internal company update. Later, all of the users in your distribution list will receive an update by your preferred notification method.

> [!NOTE]
> If you run into errors, make sure that you've successfully entered the group ID of your distribution list in the settings for the admin app.

## Monitor office absences with Power BI

After you've deployed the app and people start to send notifications that they'll be out of the office for various reasons (such
as being sick or working from home), you can use a Power BI report to track how many people have sent notifications and where they're located.  
Note that you need to [enable location tracking](#optional-enable-location-updates) to make the map control work. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the Power BI report to work, you must have at least one entry in the **CI_Employee Status** list.

We'll need some information from
the **CI_Employee Status** SharePoint list we created earlier, so let's get to it first. Open the list in your site, and then select **List Settings** under the **Settings** icon.

![Employee Status List Settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/001-SharePointList-ListSettings-nolines.PNG)

Make a note of the site name and list ID on the browser address bar, as shown in the following image.

![Employee Status List and Site Id](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/002-SharePointList-AddressAndId-nolines.PNG)

At this point, we're ready to open the Power BI report. Open Power BI, and then open the **Presence status report.pbix**
file. Hover over the right-hand side of the **CI_Employee Status** data source until you see the ellipsis. Select it, and then select **Edit query**.

![Edit query](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/003-PowerBI-EditQuery-nolines.PNG)

After the Power Query editor is opened, right-click the **CI_Employee Status** data source, and then select **Advanced Editor**.

![Power Query Advanced Editor](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/004-PowerQuery-AdvancedEditor-nolines.PNG)

This is where we use the site name and list ID from the SharePoint list.

Copy the new SharePoint site into the SharePoint.Tables string as shown in the following illustration and the list ID in the three places where the GUID is highlighted, and then select **Done**.

![Power Query Advanced Editor updates](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/005-PowerQuery-AdvancedEditorUpdates-nolines.PNG)

If you see any connection errors after updating the connection information, you might need to update the credentials used to connect to the SharePoint list. 

**To update the connection**

1. On the **File** menu, select **Options and settings**, and then select **Data source settings**.

    ![Data source settings](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/PBI-1-DataSourceSettings.PNG)

1. Select **Edit permissions**.

    ![Edit permissions](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/PBI-2-DataSourceSettings-EditPermissions.PNG)

1. Ensure the **Credentials** type is set to **Organizational account**,
and use the credentials to access the SharePoint list.

    ![Edit permissions](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/PBI-3-OrganizationalAccount.PNG)

Select **Close & Apply** to update the report to pull data from your SharePoint list.

![Power Query Close and Apply](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/006-PowerQuery-CloseAndApply-nolines.PNG)

We now have a Power BI report that shows both the geographical information for office absences for the current day and
a trend of such absences over several days. We can publish the report so other people in the organization can see it.

![Power BI Publish Report](media/sample-crisis-communication-app/007-PowerBI-Publish-nolines.PNG)

Your report is now published. You can share it with others in your organization. You can also [schedule the report refresh frequency](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh).

## Integrate your app into Teams
