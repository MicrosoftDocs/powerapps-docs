# View 3D content in canvas apps (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Add 3D content to your canvas apps. Use the **View in 3D** component to rotate and zoom into the model with simple gestures.

You can display a single 3D model, or you can let the user select from a gallery [by connecting to a **Gallery** control](#define-where-the-3d-content-is-stored).

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4vyoW]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Your 3D content must be in the .glb file format.  
>You can [convert your existing 3D models into the .glb file format](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/) from a variety of 3D formats.

To use the component, you need to [enable the mixed reality (MR) features for each app](mixed-reality-overview.md#enable-the-mixed-reality-features-for-each-app) that you want to use it in.

Make sure to also [review the prerequisites for using MR components](mixed-reality-overview.md#prerequisites).



## Use the component

Insert the component into your app as you normally would for any other control or component.

With an app open for editing in the [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.
2. Expand **Media**.
3. Select the component **View in 3D** to place it in the center of the app screen, or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

You can modify the component with a number of properties.

### Properties

The following properties are on the component's **View in 3D** pane on the **Properties** and **Advanced** tabs.

![](./media/augmented-3d/augmented-3d-viewer-controls.png)

Some properties are only available in the **Advanced** tab on the **View in 3D** pane.

Property | Description | Type | Location
- | - | - | -
Source | Data source that identifies the .glb file to display. The **View in 3D** component supports loading models from:<br/><ul><li>Publicly accessible, CORS-compliant URLs</li><li>Base64-encoded URIs</li><li>Attachments or media content accessed through data connectors</li> | Not applicable | **Properties** (also in **Advanced** as **Src**)
Background fill | Set the background color for the component. | Color picker | **Properties** (also in **Advanced** as **BackgroundFill**, where it accepts RGBA or HTML hexadecimal color codes)

### Additional properties

**[DisplayMode](./controls/properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[Height](./controls/properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**[TabIndex](./controls/properties-accessibility.md)** – Keyboard navigation order.

**[Visible](./controls/properties-core.md)** – Whether a control appears or is hidden.

**[Width](./controls/properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's left and right edges.

**[X](./controls/properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (or the screen if there's no parent container).

**[Y](./controls/properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (or the screen if there's no parent container).

## Define where the 3D content is stored

You can set the source for 3D content as a direct URL to a .glb file, as a base64-encoded URI, or as attachments or media content.

### Load models from a URL

The **Source** property can be a URL that points to a 3D model file (.glb).

You can't view a 3D model in your app if the file is on a server that has restrictive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) settings. To resolve this issue, the hosting server must permit cross-origin requests from *powerapps.com*.

You can use the following services to host and obtain a CORS-compliant URL.

**To use Dropbox**

1. Upload your file to Dropbox as you normally would.
1. Select the **Share** button.
1. Generate a public download link, for example, *https://www.dropbox.com/s/rANdoMGeneR4tedLink/my-file.glb?dl=0*.
1. Replace **www** in the URL with **dl**, and remove **?dl=0** at the end. You now have a direct-access URL, for example, *https://dl.dropbox.com/s/rANdoMGeneR4tedLink/my-file.glb*.

**To use GitHub**

1. Ensure that your git repo is set to **Public**.
1. Navigate to your file. For example, *https://github.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/blob/master/robot_arm.glb*.
1. Remove **/blob/**.
1. Replace **https://github.com** with **https://raw.githubusercontent.com**. You now have raw access to your file, for example, *https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/experimental-pcf-control-assets/master/robot_arm.glb*

### Loading base64-encoded models

The **Source** property can be a base64-encoded 3D model data URI that is in the format *data:base64,\<base64-encoded content\>*.

The following are two common ways you can create a base64-encoded URI of your model.

**To use Power Automate**

Power Automate can convert files to base64 using the dataUri(base64(*file content*)) expression. For example, if you want to store .glb files in a SharePoint Document Library, you could do the following to load them in power apps using the View In 3D:

1. Create a **SharePoint Document Library** and a **SharePoint List**. The list should have a column of type **multiple-line text**.
1. From the **Document Library**, create a new flow using the **When a new file is added in SharePoint, complete a custom action** template.
1. Add a new step to **Get file content from SharePoint**, setting **File Identifier** to **Identifier**.
1. Add a new step to **Create item from SharePoint**, setting **List Name** to the SharePoint list you created earlier, and the **Title** to the multiple-line text column, with the following expression as the URI:  
    `concat('data:base64,', Last(split(dataUri(base64(body('Get_file_content'))), ',')))`  

    ![Convert files with SharePoint](./media/augmented-3d/augmented-3d-convert-flow.png "Convert files with SharePoint")

When you add .glb files to the **Document Library**, they'll be converted to a base64-encoded data URI, which you can set to the **Source** property of the **View in 3D** component, using the SharePoint data connector to access the list.

**To use Common Data Service (CDS):**

The [Note entity](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/annotation-note-entity) in CDS converts any attached file to base64 in the **Document** field.

### Loading models as attachments or media content

Loading models as attachments or media content works through the binary storage associated with Power Apps. To check if a data connector uses binary storage, add a label and set the **Text** property to the data source. If the label starts with `appres://`, then that data source should work with the **View In 3D** component.

**To use a SharePoint List:**

1. Create a SharePoint List.
1. In the created list, click + Add column and then click Show/hide columns.
1. Make sure Attachments is checked and press Apply at the top.
1. Create a new item in the List and press Add attachments.
1. Select your 3D model (.glb file).
1. Create a new item in the list for each 3D model that you want to have in your Power App.
1. In a canvas Power App, add a Gallery.
1. Set the gallery data source to the SharePoint list created earlier.
1. Add the View In 3D control and in the Advanced tab set the Src property to First(Gallery1.Selected.Attachments).Value

**To use Excel Online**

1. Create an Excel Online workbook on OneDrive where you've also stored your .glb files.

    ![Using OneDrive to share .glb file](./media/augmented-3d/augmented-3d-onedrive-list.png "Using OneDrive to share .glb file")

1. In the workbook, create a table with columns titled **3DModel [image]** and **Name**.
1. Add a row for each .glb file, inserting the relative file path to the .glb file in the **3DModel [image]** column.

    ![Using Excel Online to share .glb file](./media/augmented-3d/augmented-3d-excel-list.png "Using Excel Online to share .glb file")

1. In a canvas-based app, add a **Gallery**.
1. Set the gallery data source to the Excel Online workbook.
1. In the **Advanced** properties tab for the **View In 3D** component, set the **Src** property to **Gallery1.Selected.3DModel**.

## Known constraints

- The security architecture of Power Apps requires HTTPS links, not HTTP.
- The server that hosts the document must not require authentication and must be [CORS-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

## Other mixed reality components

- View 3D content and images in the real world with the **[View in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md)** component.
- Measure distance, area, and volume with the **[Measure in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-measure-distance.md)** component.
- Create and view predefined 3D shapes with the **[View shape in mixed reality](mixed-reality-component-view-shape.md)** component
