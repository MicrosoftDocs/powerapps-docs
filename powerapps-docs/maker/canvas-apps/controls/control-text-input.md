# Text input control in Power Apps
A box in which the user can type text, numbers, and other data.

## Description
The user can specify data by typing into a text-input control. Depending on how you configure the app, that data might be added to a data source, used to calculate a temporary value, or incorporated in some other way.

## Key properties
**[Default](properties-core.md)** – The initial value of a control before it is changed by the user.

**[Text](properties-core.md)** – Text that appears on a control or that the user types into a control.

## Additional properties
**[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** – Label for screen readers.

**[Align](properties-text.md)** – The location of text in relation to the horizontal center of its control.

**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md)** – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**Clear** – Whether a text-input control shows an "X" that the user can tap or click to clear the contents of that control.

**[Color](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of text in a control.

**DelayOutput** – When set to true, user input is registered after half a second delay.  Useful for delaying expensive operations until user completes inputting text (i.e. for filtering when input is used in other formulas).

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[DisabledBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border if the control's **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[DisabledColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of text in a control if its **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[DisabledFill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control if its **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**EnableSpellCheck** – Whether a text-input control should use the browser spell check function. Power Apps for Windows doesn't support this property.

**[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control.

**[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[Font](properties-text.md)** – The name of the family of fonts in which text appears.

**[FontWeight](properties-text.md)** – The weight of the text in a control: **Bold**, **Semibold**, **Normal**, or **Lighter**.

**Format** – Whether the user input is restricted to numbers only or can be any text.

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**HintText** – Light-grey text that appears in an input-text control if it's empty.

**[HoverBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the user keeps the mouse pointer on that control.

**[HoverColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of the text in a control when the user keeps the mouse pointer on it.

**[HoverFill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control when the user keeps the mouse pointer on it.

**[Italic](properties-text.md)** – Whether the text in a control is italic.

**[LineHeight](properties-text.md)** – The distance between, for example, lines of text or items in a list.

**MaxLength** – The number of characters that the user can type into a text-input control.

**Mode** – The control is in **SingleLine**, **MultiLine**, or **Password** mode.

**[OnChange](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user changes the value of a control (for example, by adjusting a slider).

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

**[PaddingBottom](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the bottom edge of that control.

**[PaddingLeft](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the left edge of that control.

**[PaddingRight](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the right edge of that control.

**[PaddingTop](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the top edge of that control.

**[PressedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the user taps or clicks that control.

**[PressedColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of text in a control when the user taps or clicks that control.

**[PressedFill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control when the user taps or clicks that control.

**[RadiusBottomLeft](properties-size-location.md)** – The degree to which the bottom-left corner of a control is rounded.

**[RadiusBottomRight](properties-size-location.md)** – The degree to which the bottom-right corner of a control is rounded.

**[RadiusTopLeft](properties-size-location.md)** – The degree to which the top-left corner of a control is rounded.

**[RadiusTopRight](properties-size-location.md)** – The degree to which the top-right corner of a control is rounded.

**[Strikethrough](properties-text.md)** – Whether a line appears through the text that appears on a control.

**[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** – Keyboard navigation order in relation to other controls.

**[Tooltip](properties-core.md)** – Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

## Examples
### Collect data
1. Add two text-input controls, and name them **inputFirst** and **inputLast**.
   
    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?
2. Add a button, set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to **Add**, and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **Collect(Names, {FirstName:inputFirst.Text, LastName:inputLast.Text})**
   
    Want more information about the **[Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?
3. Add a text gallery in portrait/vertical orientation, set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to **Names**, and set the **[Text](properties-core.md)** property of **Subtitle1** to **ThisItem.FirstName**.
4. (optional) In the template gallery, delete the bottom label, named **Body1**, and set the **[TemplateSize](control-gallery.md)** property of the gallery to **80**.
5. Press F5, type a string of text into **inputFirst** and **inputLast**, and then click or tap the **Add** button.
6. (optional) Add more names to the collection, and then press Esc to return to the default workspace.

### Prompt for a password

1. Add a text-input control, name it **inputPassword**, and set its **Mode** property to **Password**.

1. Add a label, and set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **If(inputPassword.Text = "P@ssw0rd", "Access granted", "Access denied")**

    Want more information about the **[If](../functions/function-if.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?

1. Press F5, and then type **P\@ssw0rd** in **inputPassword**.

    When you finish typing the password, the label stops showing **Access denied** and starts to show **Access granted**.

1. To return to the default workspace, press Esc.

1. (optional) Add a control such as an arrow, configure it to navigate to another screen, and show it only after the user types the password.

1. (optional) Add a button, configure its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to show **Sign in**, add a timer, and disable the input-text control for a certain amount of time if the user types the wrong password and then clicks or taps the **Sign in** button.


## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
* [Standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md) apply.

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
