## Examples
### Add a basic formula to a button
1. Add a **[Text input](control-text-input.md)** control, and name it **Source**.
   
    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?
2. Add a **Button** control, set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to "Add", and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **UpdateContext({Total:Total + Value(Source.Text)})**
   
    Want more information about the **[UpdateContext](../functions/function-updatecontext.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?
3. Add a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control, set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property in the formula bar to **Value(Total)**, and then press **F5**.
4. Clear the default text from **Source**, type a number in it, and then click or tap **Add**.
   
    The **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control shows the number that you typed.
5. Clear the number from **Source**, type another number in it, and then click or tap **Add**.
   
    The **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control shows the sum of the two numbers that you typed.
6. (optional) Repeat the previous step one or more times.
7. To return to the default workspace, press Esc (or click or tap the close icon in the upper-right corner).

### Configure a button with multiple formulas
Add a formula that clears the **Text input** control between entries.

1. Set the **[HintText](control-text-input.md)** property of **Source** to "Enter a number".
2. Set the **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property of **Add** to this formula:
   
    **UpdateContext({Total:Total + Value(Source.Text)});<br>UpdateContext({ClearInput: ""})**
   
    > [!NOTE]
   > Separate multiple formulas with a semi-colon “**;**”.
3. Set the **[Default](properties-core.md)** property of **Source** to **ClearInput**.
4. Press **F5**, and then test the app by adding several numbers together.

### Add another button to reset the total
Add a second button to clear the total between calculations.

1. Add another **Button** control, set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to "Clear", and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:
   
    **UpdateContext({Total:0})**
2. Press **F5**, add several numbers together, and then click or tap **Clear** to reset the total.

### Change a button's appearance
#### Change a button's shape
By default, Power Apps creates a rectangular **Button** control with rounded corners. You can make basic modifications to the shape of a **Button** control by setting its **[Height](properties-size-location.md)**, **[Width](properties-size-location.md)**, and **[Radius](properties-size-location.md)** properties.

> [!NOTE]
> [Icons and Shapes](control-shapes-icons.md) provide a wide variety of designs and can perform some of the same basic functions that **Button** controls do. However, **[Icons and Shapes](control-shapes-icons.md)** don’t have a **[Text](properties-core.md)** property.

1. Add a **Button** control, and set its **[Height](properties-size-location.md)** and **[Width](properties-size-location.md)** properties to **300** to make a large square button.
2. Modify the **[RadiusTopLeft](properties-size-location.md)**, **[RadiusTopRight](properties-size-location.md)**, **[RadiusBottomLeft](properties-size-location.md)**, and **[RadiusBottomRight](properties-size-location.md)** properties to adjust the amount of curvature on each corner. Here are some examples of different shapes, each one starting from a 300 x 300 square button:
   
   * Set all four **[Radius](properties-size-location.md)** values to **150** to create a circle.
   * Set the values for **[RadiusTopLeft](properties-size-location.md)** and **[RadiusBottomRight](properties-size-location.md)** to **300** to create a leaf-shaped **Button**.
   * Set the values for **[RadiusTopLeft](properties-size-location.md)** and **[RadiusTopRight](properties-size-location.md)** to **300**, and the values for **[RadiusBottomLeft](properties-size-location.md)** and **[RadiusBottomRight](properties-size-location.md)** to **100** to create a tab-shaped button.

#### Change a button's color when you hover over it
By default, the fill color of a **Button** control will dim by 20% when you hover over it with a mouse. You can adjust this behavior by changing the **[HoverFill](properties-color-border.md)** property, which uses the **[ColorFade](../functions/function-colors.md)** function. If you set the **[ColorFade](../functions/function-colors.md)** formula to a positive percentage, the color becomes lighter when you hover over the button, while a negative percentage makes the color darker.

* Change the **[ColorFade](../functions/function-colors.md)** percentage in the **[HoverFill](properties-color-border.md)** property of one of the buttons that you created, and observe the effects.

You can also specify the color of a **Button** control by setting its **[HoverFill](properties-color-border.md)** property to a formula that contains the **[ColorValue](../functions/function-colors.md)** function instead of the **[ColorFade](../functions/function-colors.md)** function, as in **ColorValue("Red")**.

> [!NOTE]
> The color value can be any CSS color definition, either a name or a hex value.

* Replace the **[ColorFade](../functions/function-colors.md)** function with a **[ColorValue](../functions/function-colors.md)** function in one of the buttons that you created, and observe the effects.


## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
* [Standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md) apply.

### Screen reader support
* **[Text](properties-core.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
