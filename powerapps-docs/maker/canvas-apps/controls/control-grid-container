# Grid Container Control in Power Apps

The **Grid container** control allows you to **layout child components anywhere in a grid pattern**, giving precise control over row and column placement.

CSS-style grids inspire this container: you can define **rows and columns** and position each child exactly where you want using child properties.

---

## Description

The **Grid** container control provides a flexible layout system for Canvas apps, enabling:

- Placement of child components in a **grid pattern**
- Specification of **row and column start/end** for each child
- Responsive adjustments when the container or screen size changes
- Alignment, spacing, and overflow control within the grid

This approach eliminates the need for manually positioning each component, making apps **more maintainable and responsive**.

## Grid Container Properties

### Display

- **Gap** – The spacing in pixels between child components inside the grid.
- **Rows** – The number of rows in the grid layout.
- **Columns** – The number of columns in the grid layout.

- **Position**
  - **X** – The horizontal distance from the left edge of the parent container (or screen if no parent).
  - **Y** – The vertical distance from the top edge of the parent container (or screen if no parent).

- **Size**
  - **Width** – The width of the grid container.
  - **Height** – The height of the grid container.

- **Padding**
  - **Top / Bottom / Left / Right** – The spacing between the container edges and its child components.

### Color & Border

- **Color** – Foreground color of the container (used for borders and text if applicable).
- **Border**
  - **Style** – Type of border: Solid, Dashed, Dotted, or None.
  - **Thickness** – Width of the border in pixels.
  - **Color** – Color of the border.
- **Border radius** – The degree to which the corners of the container are rounded (applied to all corners uniformly or can be split into individual corners in advanced settings).
- **Drop shadow** – Shadow effect applied to the container. Options: None, Light, Medium, or Heavy.

### Visibility

- **Visible** – Whether the grid container is displayed. Toggle On/Off.

### Grid Layout Properties (Child-specific)

- **Row Start / Row End** – Defines the starting and ending rows for a child component.

## Example

1. Create a [blank canvas app](../create-blank-app.md) with **Responsive** layout.
2. Create a new screen.
3. From the **Insert** pane under **Layout**, select **Grid container**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Insert grid container](../media/create-responsive-layout/insert-grid-container.png "Insert Grid Container")

4. Set container properties to occupy the full screen:  
   - X = 0  
   - Y = 0  
   - Width = Parent.Width  
   - Height = Parent.Height

5. Add several child components (buttons, text inputs, icons, media). For each child, set grid placement properties:  
   - Column Start / End  
   - Row Start / End  
   - Align in Cell

6. Press **F5** to preview. Resize the screen and observe how child components **remain in their grid positions** and adjust responsively.
