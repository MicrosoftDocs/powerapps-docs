## Example
### Create a set of images
1. Add a **Pen input** control, name it **MyDoodles**, and set its **ShowControls** property to **true**.
   
    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?
2. Add a **[Button](control-button.md)** control, move it below **MyDoodles**, and set the **[Text](properties-core.md)** property of the **[Button](control-button.md)** control to show **Add**.
3. Set the **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property of the **[Button](control-button.md)** control to this formula:<br>
   **Collect(Doodles, {Sketch:MyDoodles.Image})**
4. Add an **Image gallery** control, move it below the **[Button](control-button.md)** control, and shrink the width of the **Image gallery** control until it shows three items.
5. Set the **[Items](properties-core.md)** property of the **Image gallery** control to **Doodles**, and then  press F5.
6. Draw an image in **MyDoodles**, and then click or tap the **[Button](control-button.md)** control.
   
    The image that you drew appears in the **Image gallery** control.
7. (optional) In the **Pen input** control, click or tap the icon to clear the image that you drew, draw another image, and then click or tap the **[Button](control-button.md)** control.
8. In the **Image gallery** control, set the **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property of the **[Image](control-image.md)** control to this formula:<br>
   **Remove(Doodles, ThisItem)**
9. Remove a drawing by clicking or tapping it in the **Image gallery** control.

Use the **[SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md)** function to save your drawings locally or the **[Patch](../functions/function-patch.md)** function to save them to a data source.


## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and the color outside the control (if there is a border)
* **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** and the color outside the control (if there is no border)

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** should be present.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
  > **Pen input** is not accessible to screen reader users. Always provide an alternative form of input. For example, if a sketch is required, consider adding an **[Add picture](control-add-picture.md)** control for users to upload an image. Both methods can be offered and the user can choose the one they are more comfortable with.

### Keyboard support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pen input** is not accessible to keyboard users. Always provide an alternative form of input. For example, if a signature is required, consider adding a **[Text input](control-text-input.md)** for users to enter their name. Both methods can be offered and the user can choose the one they are more comfortable with.
