# Date picker modern control in canvas apps

A calendar-based date selection control with flexible formatting and localization options.

## Description

Use the **Date picker** control to let users select a date from a visual calendar interface. The control supports multiple date formats, timezone handling, and customizable date ranges. Key properties for this control are **SelectedDate**, **Format**, and **DateTimeZone**.

## General

**Placeholder** – Hint text that appears when no date is selected. Default is **"Select a date"**.

**DefaultDate** – The initial date selected in the control before the user makes a change. Use this to set a default date when the picker first loads.

**Format** – The display format for the selected date. Accepts `DatePickerFormat` enum values or a custom format string:

**Enum values:**

| Value | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `DatePickerFormat.LongAbbreviated` | Abbreviated month with full year (default) | Jan 15, 2024 |
| `DatePickerFormat.Short` | Short numeric format | 1/15/2024 |
| `DatePickerFormat.Long` | Full month name with year | January 15, 2024 |

**Custom format strings:**

You can also use custom date format patterns as strings to create specific date representations:

| Format string | Example output |
|---------------|----------------|
| `"dd-mm-yyyy"` | 15-01-2024 |
| `"dd-mm"` | 15-01 |
| `"yyyy-mm-dd"` | 2024-01-15 |
| `"dd/mm/yyyy"` | 15/01/2024 |
| `"mm/dd/yyyy"` | 01/15/2024 |

Use custom format strings when you need a specific date representation not available in the enum values. Example: `Format = "dd-mm-yyyy"`.

**DateTimeZone** – The timezone used for date display and storage. Accepts `DateTimeZone` enum values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `DateTimeZone.Local` | User's local timezone (default) |
| `DateTimeZone.UTC` | Coordinated Universal Time |

**Visible** – Whether the control appears or is hidden. Use a Power Fx formula to show or hide the control based on app state.

## Behavior

**OnChange** – How the app responds when the user selects a different date. This event fires when the date selection changes.

**DisplayMode** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**). In **View** mode, the selected date is shown but the calendar cannot be opened.

**IsEditable** – Whether the user can type a date directly into the input field or must use the calendar picker. When `false`, users must click the calendar icon to select a date. Default is **false**.

## Date range

**StartDate** – The earliest date that can be selected in the calendar. Dates before this are disabled. Default is **Date(1900, 1, 1)**.

**EndDate** – The latest date that can be selected in the calendar. Dates after this are disabled. Default is **Date(Year(Today())+100, 12, 31)**.

**StartOfWeek** – The day that appears as the first column in the calendar view. Accepts `StartOfWeek` enum values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `StartOfWeek.Sunday` | Week starts on Sunday (default) |
| `StartOfWeek.Monday` | Week starts on Monday |
| `StartOfWeek.Tuesday` | Week starts on Tuesday |
| `StartOfWeek.Wednesday` | Week starts on Wednesday |
| `StartOfWeek.Thursday` | Week starts on Thursday |
| `StartOfWeek.Friday` | Week starts on Friday |
| `StartOfWeek.Saturday` | Week starts on Saturday |

## Data

**SelectedDate** – (Output) The date currently selected by the user. Returns a date value that can be used in formulas. Returns `Blank()` if no date is selected.

## Validation

**ValidationState** – The current validation state of the control. Accepts `ValidationState` enum values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ValidationState.Error` | The control value has an error |
| `ValidationState.None` | No validation applied (default) |

## Size and position

**X** – Distance between the left edge of the control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**Y** – Distance between the top edge of the control and the top edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**Width** – Distance between the control's left and right edges. Default is **320**.

**Height** – Distance between the control's top and bottom edges. Default is **32**.

**PaddingTop** – Distance between the text and the top edge of the control.

**PaddingBottom** – Distance between the text and the bottom edge of the control.

**PaddingLeft** – Distance between the text and the left edge of the control.

**PaddingRight** – Distance between the text and the right edge of the control.

## Style and theme

**Strikethrough** – Whether a line appears through the middle of the text.

**Fill** – The background fill color of the control.

**BorderColor** – The color of the control's border.

**BorderStyle** – The style of the control's border. Accepts `BorderStyle` enum values: `BorderStyle.Solid`, `BorderStyle.Dashed`, `BorderStyle.Dotted`, or `BorderStyle.None`.

**BorderThickness** – The thickness of the control's border in pixels.

**RadiusTopLeft** – The corner radius for the top-left corner of the control.

**RadiusTopRight** – The corner radius for the top-right corner of the control.

## Accessibility

**AccessibleLabel** – A label for screen readers to announce what the control is for. Should describe the purpose of the date picker, not the current selection.

**ContentLanguage** – The language used for formatting dates and calendar display. Inherits from app settings if not specified.

## Example

The following YAML example shows date picker controls for selecting dates:

```yaml

    Properties:
      Placeholder: ="Select start date"
      Format: =DatePickerFormat.LongAbbreviated
      DateTimeZone: =DateTimeZone.Local
      DefaultDate: =Today()
      StartDate: =Today()
      EndDate: =Today() + 365
      StartOfWeek: =StartOfWeek.Monday
      X: =40
      Y: =100
      Width: =280
      Height: =32

- EndDatePicker:
    Control: ModernDatePicker@1.0.0
    Properties:
      Placeholder: ="Select end date"
      Format: =DatePickerFormat.Short
      DateTimeZone: =DateTimeZone.Local
      DefaultDate: =Today() + 7
      StartOfWeek: =StartOfWeek.Monday
      X: =340
      Y: =100
      Width: =280

## Updates to Date picker starting Feb 2026

This updated version of the Date picker modern control includes the following improvements and changes.

### Property renames

The following properties have been renamed. Update any formulas in your app that reference the old names.

| Previous property | New property |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `FontColor` | `Color` |
| `FontSize` | `Size` |
| `FontItalic` | `Italic` |
| `FontStrikethrough` | `Strikethrough` |
| `FontUnderline` | `Underline` |
| `BorderRadius` | `RadiusTopLeft`, `RadiusTopRight`, `RadiusBottomLeft`, `RadiusBottomRight` |

### Removed properties

| Removed property | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| `Required` | Use `ValidationState` instead to control validation styling. |

### Bug fixes and improvements

- **DisplayMode.View properly enforced**: In **View** mode, the control is now properly read-only and the calendar cannot be opened. Previously, the picker was still editable in View mode.
- **Format property fully honored**: All format values are now properly applied. Previously, certain format values were ignored until another change was made.
- **DateTimeZone respected**: The **DateTimeZone** property now correctly applies to date display and storage. Previously, this property value was sometimes ignored.
- **Blank value handling**: When the control is in **View** mode with a blank value, it no longer incorrectly shows a previous value.
- **Mobile calendar improvements**: Calendar flyout is now properly sized for mobile devices, with optimized defaults (width 560, height 64, font size 24).
- **Month/Year flyout positioning**: Fixed issue where the month/year selector would go off-screen on smaller displays.
- **Gallery and data card stability**: Resolved crashes that occurred when adding the date picker to galleries or data cards.
- **Color palette inheritance**: The calendar flyout now properly respects the **BasePaletteColor** override.
- **Command bar integration**: The authoring command bar and right-click menu now show Font, Font Size, Font color, and Background color for quick access.
- **DefaultDate property**: New property allows setting an initial date when the picker first loads.

## Limitations

- The calendar icon does not scale with font size in the current version.
- On mobile devices, the control shows the Fluent calendar view instead of the native mobile date picker.
