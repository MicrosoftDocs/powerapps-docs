# Drop down modern control in Power Apps

[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

Select a value from the list of items.

## Description
A **Drop down** control conserves screen real estate, especially when the list contains a large number of choices. The control takes up only one line unless the user selects the chevron to reveal more choices.

## Key properties

**[Items](../properties-core.md)** – The source of data that contains the items that appear in the control. If the source has multiple columns, set the control's **Value** property to the column of data that you want to show.

**Required** - must fill in field.

**Display mode** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), only displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).


## Additional properties
**Accessible label** – Label for screen readers.

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Size](../properties-text.md)** – The size of the control on canvas.
