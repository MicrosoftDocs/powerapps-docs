[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

**Base palette color** - The color palette applied to a control. This impacts all surfaces of the control that render a theme color.  

**Required** - must fill in field.

**Display mode** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), only displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).


## Additional properties
**Accessible label** – Label for screen readers.

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).
