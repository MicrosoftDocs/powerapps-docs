# Use modern themes in canvas apps

Modern themes are pre-established style sets that can transform the look of your app. These themes, based on Microsoft's Fluent design language, modify various style aspects such as color, typography, borders, and shadows, ensuring a visually pleasing interface.

Modern themes streamline the customization process and enable creators to effortlessly design an app with a unified and consistent visual appeal.

## Prerequisites

Enable the modern themes feature in the settings of Power Apps app:

1. Open your app or create a new app.
1. From your app, open **Settings** from the app authoring menu or [modern command bar](../../power-apps-studio.md#1--power-apps-studio-modern-command-bar).
1. Go to **Updates** > **New** > **Modern controls and themes**.
1. Set the **Modern controls and themes** toggle to **On**.
1. Close the **Settings** popup.

For more information, see [Enable modern controls and themes for your app](overview-modern-controls.md#enable-modern-controls-and-themes-for-your-app).

> [!NOTE]
> When modern controls and themes is enabled, you can't select classic themes from the command bar. To use *retired* classic themes, go to **Keep classic themes** on the **Retired** tab of **Updates**  in **Settings** and toggle it to **On**.

## Create a theme

There are several out-of-the-box themes available to style your app. You can also design your own theme for a more personalized visual aesthetic.

1. On the app authoring menu, select ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
1. On the **Themes** pane, select **Add a theme**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-a-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the location of the Add a theme selector.":::

   The **Create a theme** dialog appears.

    :::image type="content" source="media/theme-create-custom-theme.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Create a theme user interface.":::

1. In the **Create a theme** dialog, choose or enter the following information:

   | Feature | Action or description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | Primary (seed) color | Choose a color from the color picker. You can, alternatively, enter the hexadecimal or RGB manually. |
   | Lock primary color (preview) | The 16-slot theme palette is generated using the seed color. <br>- Toggled off: The 16-slot palette is optimized for accessibility. Toggled off is the default option. <br>- Toggled on: The seed color is placed in the primary (middle) slot of the palette. The remaining colors are generated by making the colors incrementally lighter on one side and darker on the other side. The generated palette might not meet contrast ratio accessibility requirements. |
   | Theme name | Enter a unique theme name. |
   | Font | Choose your default font used by the controls in the app. |
   | Torsion | Impacts the tint, shade, or tone of the palette. Torsion isn't applicable if you choose **Lock primary color**. |
   | Vibrancy | Impacts the muteness or brightness of the palette. Vibrancy isn't applicable if you choose **Lock primary color**. |
   | Palette overrides | Override the color used for one or more slots in the palette by selecting a slot and choosing a new color. You can select **Reset** to return to the generated value for that slot. See [slot descriptions](#slot-descriptions) for general guidance on how each slot is utilized in the Fluent design language. Note that deviations may be present in individual control utilization of the palette.  |
   
   Optionally, you can look at a static preview of your new theme. Interact with the sample controls to see how your theme is applied to the rest state and various interaction states. :::image type="content" source="media/preview-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Preview section of the pane when you create or edit a theme. "::: |

1. Select **Create**.

Your new theme is created and applied to your app.

## Apply modern theme

1. On the app authoring menu, select ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
2. On the **Themes** pane, select one of the default themes.
3. If you have classic controls in your app, you're prompted to apply the modern theme to these controls. You can always select **Undo** from the command bar if you don't like the theme.
   > [!NOTE]
   > When you choose to apply modern themes to classic controls, Power Fx formulas are set on properties of the impacted controls that reference variables from the modern theme. Visually, classic controls might not align exactly with their modern control counterparts, as the classic controls are not based on Fluent v9.

When a modern theme is selected, the style of the theme is automatically applied to the controls in your app. This action sets the **App.Theme** property.

## Edit a theme

You can edit the theme and change one or more parameters of the custom theme.

1. On the app authoring menu, select ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.

1. On the **Themes** pane, find the tile of the theme you want to edit and select the overflow menu and then **Edit**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/theme-options-edit.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the ellipses points where you can select Edit.":::

1. On the **Edit theme** pane, adjust the theme as needed.
1. Select **Save** or cancel out of the dialog.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't edit out-of-the-box themes.

## Delete a theme

If you decide you no longer need a custom theme in your app, you can delete it.

1. On the app authoring menu, select ![Themes icon](media/theme-icon.png) **Themes**.
1. On the **Themes** pane, find theme that you want to edit, select the overflow menu, then select **Delete**.
1. On the confirmation dialog box, select **Delete theme**.

If you have any Power Fx formulas that reference this theme in your app, you need to manually update the formula.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete out-of-the-box themes.

## Use themes with Power Fx

Modern theme objects are available for makers to use through Power Fx. The currently active theme object can be referenced by **App.Theme**. Any theme loaded into the app can be referenced by its instance name such as **RedTheme**. We recommend that you reference the theme object using **App.Theme** to ensure that the color selections adapt to theme changes.  

Each theme object includes the following information:

- **Name** of the theme
- **Colors**, a 16-color brand ramp collection individually accessible by name; **Primary foreground color** is the default text color, for example the color of text on a background
- **Font** used in the theme

The image shows the slot variables inside the **Colors** collection and, as an example, the corresponding colors for the **Steel** theme.  

:::image type="content" source="media/modern-themes-color-ramp.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the slot variables and 16-part color brand ramp for the steel theme.":::

Using the theme brand ramp, you can manually style a classic control based on the current modern theme, for example `Button.Fill = App.Theme.Colors.Primary`.

### Palette slot descriptions

When overriding individual slots in the palette, you may refer to this general guidance on how each slot is utilized in the native Fluent controls. Note that deviations may be present in how individual controls inside Power Apps utilize the modern theme palette.

| Slot | Description |
|---------|----------|
| Darker70 | **Primary text, key icons, and high-emphasis borders.** <br><br>Darker70 is the darkest in the palette and provides maximum contrast for primary text, important icons, and high-emphasis borders. It is frequently used in headers, key labels, and elements requiring strong focus. This color ensures critical content remains legible and visually distinct, enhancing accessibility and user clarity in Fluent designs.| 
| Darker60 | **Secondary headings and selected states.** <br><br> Darker60 provides strong contrast while being slightly lighter than Darker70. It’s used for secondary headings, selected states, and visible borders that complement primary elements. This color balances emphasis and subtlety, appearing in elements like selected text highlights, secondary button text, and focused states around interactive components. |
| Darker50 | **Placeholder text, secondary icons, and inactive elements.** <br><br> Darker50 is lighter than Darker60 and is primarily applied to placeholder text, secondary icons, and inactive elements. It supports visual hierarchy by clearly differentiating less emphasized elements from primary content. Typical uses include text field hints, inactive radio buttons, and dimmed icons for features not currently available. |
| Darker40 | **Pressed states.** <br><br> Darker40 is used for pressed states in interactive elements such as buttons, list items, or menu options. It provides a darker, more pronounced feedback when users engage with a control, ensuring clarity about active interactions. This color is also used for elements like pressed backgrounds in dropdown menus or for accentuating highly interactive components where the user’s focus is required. |
| Darker30 | **Hover states of secondary elements and lightly emphasized content.** <br><br> Darker30 is designed for hover states on secondary elements, such as inactive menu items or lightly emphasized content like subtle dividers. |
| Darker20 | **Borders and tertiary button hover states.** <br><br> Darker20 provides subtle definition for borders and is also used in tertiary button hover states. Its contrast ensures secondary and tertiary interactive elements remain clear without dominating the UI. This color often appears in list item dividers and other light boundary markers. |
| Darker10 | **Hover states for primary buttons and interactive elements.** <br><br> Darker10 is applied to hover states for primary buttons and other interactive components, providing visual feedback to indicate interactivity. It ensures these elements stand out momentarily as users navigate, enhancing clarity and engagement. |
| PrimaryColor | **Backgrounds of active buttons and selected states.** <br><br> PrimaryColor is used for backgrounds in active button states, such as primary buttons, as well as for selected states in checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns. This color ensures active elements are easily distinguishable while maintaining a cohesive visual design. |
| Lighter10 | **Hover backgrounds in buttons, lists, and dropdowns.** <br><br> Lighter10 serves as the hover background for interactive elements, such as buttons, list items, and dropdown menus. Its slightly lighter tone provides subtle visual feedback, enhancing interactivity without overwhelming the design. |
| Lighter20 | **Backgrounds of text input fields.** <br><br> Lighter20 is used for backgrounds of editable input fields in their default states. It ensures a neutral yet modern appearance, supporting text and icon clarity while seamlessly integrating into Fluent’s overall design language. |
| Lighter30 | **Backgrounds of secondary buttons and inactive input fields.** <br><br> Lighter30 is applied to the backgrounds of secondary buttons and inactive input fields, providing subtle contrast to differentiate these elements from primary or active states. It’s also used for disabled elements, ensuring visual consistency across less interactive UI components. |
| Lighter40 | **Tertiary button backgrounds and subtle surfaces.** <br><br> Lighter40 is used for tertiary button backgrounds and other subtle UI surfaces, such as light panels or cards. It provides understated contrast to support a layered, visually distinct hierarchy in Fluent designs. |
| Lighter50 | **Light borders and inactive outlines.** <br><br> Lighter50 is used for light borders and inactive outlines on elements such as cards, dropdowns, and inactive input fields. Its subtle definition enhances structural clarity while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic. |
| Lighter60 | **Hover states for lighter interactive elements.** <br><br> Lighter60 is used for hover states on lighter interactive elements, such as dropdown items, inactive list entries, or tertiary buttons. It provides subtle feedback, ensuring users can identify interactivity without disrupting the overall design. |
| Lighter70 | **Backgrounds of non-editable fields and subtle focus states.** <br><br> Lighter70 is applied to backgrounds of non-editable fields and subtle focus states, helping differentiate these elements from editable or interactive ones. It provides a neutral, understated treatment that preserves the design’s clarity and hierarchy. |
| Lighter80 | **Lightest backgrounds in panels, cards, and overlays.** <br><br> Lighter80 is the lightest shade in the palette, used for backgrounds in panels, cards, and overlays. It provides a neutral canvas that highlights content while minimizing visual distractions. This color is ideal for creating an open, spacious feel in UI designs. |
