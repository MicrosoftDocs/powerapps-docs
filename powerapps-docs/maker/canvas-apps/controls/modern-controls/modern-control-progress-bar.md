## Description
The progress bar can be configured to show various states of progress in the apps. This versatile control can be used to inform users on their progress as they work on the app or can be used to show loading scenarios.

**Shape** – The shape of the bar and track. The shape property affects the corners of the bar. 

**Indeterminate** – Set the bar to determinate or indeterminate.

**Color** – The color prop can be used to indicate a "brand" state (default), "error" state (red), "warning" state (orange), or "success" state (green).

**Value** – A decimal number between 0 and 'max', which specifies how much of the task has been completed. Only applicable for determinate state.
