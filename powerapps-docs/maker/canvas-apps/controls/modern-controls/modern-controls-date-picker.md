# Date picker control in Power Apps
A control that the user can select to specify a date.

## Description
Adding a Date Picker control instead of a Text input control ensures the user specifies a date in the correct format. The key properties for this control are **Format**, **ValidationState**, and **OnChange**.

## General

**PlaceHolder** - Instructional text that appears if no dates are entered. 

**Format** – The text format in which the control shows the date the user specified. The date format can be short, LongAbbreviated, YearMonth, or Custom. For example: 

- Short - 2/1/2024 

- LongAbbreviated - Thurs, Feb 1, 2024 

- YearMonth - February 2024

- Custom - Users are able to specify a valid date format using a string such as: "MM/YY", "dd/mm/yyyy"

  > [!NOTE]
  > Currently there are issues with the **Short** and **YearMonth** options. We are actively working on a fix, so no action is needed from makers at this time. Once the fix is deployed, the functions will operate normally. In the meantime, you can use the custom format option to achieve the same formatting. 

**AccessibleLabel** – Label for screen readers.

**Visible** - Whether a control appears or is hidden. 

## Behavior 

**DisplayMode** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).

## Size and position

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**Width** - The distance between the control's left and right edges. 

**Height** - The distance between the control's top and bottom edges. 

## Style and theme

**BasePaletteColor** - The color palette applied to a control impacts all surfaces of the control that render a theme color.  

**Font** - The name of the font family in which text appears. 

**FontSize** - The font size of the text that appears on a control. If the value is null or zero, the font size is driven by the selected Fluent theme. 

**FontColor** - The color of text in a control. 

**FontWeight** - The weight of the text in a control: **Bold**, **Lighter**, **Normal**, or **Semibold**

**FontItalic** - Whether the text in a control is italic. 

**FontUnderline** - Whether a line appears under the text that appears on a control. 

**FontStrikethrough** - Whether a line appears through the text that appears on a control. 

## Additional properties

**Required** – You can mandate the date picker as required field in a context.

**EndDate** - The latest date to which the user can set value of a date-picker control. 

**IsEditable** - Whether the Date Picker text can be edited. If false, the date can only be changed by using the calendar. 

**OnChange** – Actions to perform when the user changes the value of a control. 

**SelectedDate** - The date currently selected in a date control. This date is represented in local time. 

**StartDate** - The earliest date to which the user can set the value of a date-picker control. 

**StartOfWeek** - The day of the week to display in the first day column of the date-picker control. 

**ValidationState** - The control has two states, which are **Error** and **None**. When the error state is selected the date picker border is highlighted in red.
