# Overview of modern controls in canvas apps

[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

Modern controls in canvas apps are a new set of controls that are based on Microsoft design system. Modern controls are quicker and simpler for makers to configure. They also provide a more cohesive experience for end-users. Modern controls are designed with a focus on accessibility, usability, and performance that makes them visually appealing, highly functional, and intuitive to use.

> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.


## Enable modern controls for your app
With your [canvas app open for editing](../../edit-app.md):
1. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Upcoming features**.
2. From the Preview tab, set the toggle for **Try out the modern controls** to **On**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Turn on modern controls](media/settings-panel.png)

3. On the app authoring menu, select **Insert**.
4. From the list of controls, select **Modern controls**.

You'll see list of all the modern controls.
