# Overview of modern controls and themes in canvas apps (preview)

[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

Modern controls in canvas apps are a new set of controls that are based on the Microsoft Fluent design system. These controls are quicker and simpler for makers to configure, and they also provide a more cohesive experience for end-users. Modern controls are designed with a focus on accessibility, usability, and performance that makes them visually appealing, highly functional, and intuitive to use. Bundled with the modern controls is a new modern theming system, also rooted in the Fluent design system, that allows an app's look and feel to be modified from a central place.

## What's next for these controls and themes?
We're consistently improving and adding new capabilities for modern controls and themes. See our blog for [what's new](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229189).
  
## Provide feedback to Microsoft

To provide feedback, offer suggestions, or report issues, go to [community forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2229838).

You can also provide feedback for individual controls in the Power Apps Studio from the control properties by selecting the thumbs up or down and comments option. The same feedback mechanism is available for modern themes in the **Themes** pane.
