# Overview of modern controls and themes in canvas apps

Modern controls in canvas apps are a new set of controls that are based on the [Microsoft Fluent 2 design system](https://fluent2.microsoft.design). These controls are quicker and simpler for makers to configure, and they also provide a more cohesive experience for end-users. Modern controls are designed with a focus on accessibility, usability, and performance that makes them visually appealing, highly functional, and intuitive to use. Bundled with the modern controls is a new modern theming system, based on the Fluent 2 design system, that allows an app's look and feel to be modified from a central place.  


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  A subset of modern controls are now generally available for production use.


## Enable modern controls and themes for your app
With your [canvas app open for editing](../../edit-app.md):
1. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **General**.
2. From the Preview tab, set the toggle for **Modern controls and themes** to **On**.

- The app will refresh with the new app authoring menu with modern controls part of existing categories. There will be two additional categories for legacy controls - Classic and Classic icons.
