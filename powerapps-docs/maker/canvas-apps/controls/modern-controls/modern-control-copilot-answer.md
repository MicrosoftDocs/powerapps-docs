# Copilot answer modern control in Power Apps (preview)

[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

A control that makers can use to add predefined questions that end users can use to get generated answers.

## Description

Makers can use the Copilot answer control to set predefined questions that end users can use to get generative answers with a single click. The control is optimized for mobile users and is powered by Microsoft Copilot.

## Key properties

**Data source (Items)** – The Copilot answer control only supports Dataverse as the data source. The answer to the question comes from the Dataverse table that you select.

**Views** – A user can select any of the views that are available in the data source.  

**Fields** - Default list of fields available for the table. Users can select **Edit** to see the list of fields. They can also add or modify the fields based on their requirements.  

**Title** – A label that is displayed at the top of the Copilot answer control.  

**Question for Copilot** – This is the question a maker asks the Copilot answer control. The question is used as the prompt to generate a response that is displayed by the answer control that's based on the selected **Data source** property.


## Additional properties

**Show answer** – Should the Copilot answer control answer a question when the user clicks on the ‘Arrow’ icon (After sending) or as soon as the control loads when the question is defined in the properties window (Immediate).

**DisplayMode** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), only displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).

**Position** - Whether a control appears or is hidden.

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Size](../properties-text.md)** – The size of the control on the canvas
