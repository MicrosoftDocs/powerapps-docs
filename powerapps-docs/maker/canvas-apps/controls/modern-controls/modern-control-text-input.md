# Text input modern control in Power Apps (preview)

[This article is pre-release document and is subject to change.]

A box in which the user can type text, numbers, and other data.

## Description
The user can specify data by typing into a **Text input** control. Depending on how you configure the app, that data might be added to a data source, used to calculate a temporary value, or incorporated in some other way.

## Key properties

**Value** – The initial value of a control before it's changed by the user.

**Mode** – The control is in SingleLine or MultiLine mode.

**Required** – must fill in field or not.

**Display mode** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), only displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).


## Additional properties
**Accessible label** – Label for screen readers.

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Size](../properties-text.md)** – The size of the control on the canvas.
