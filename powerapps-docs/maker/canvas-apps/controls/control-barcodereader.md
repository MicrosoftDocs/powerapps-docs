# Barcode reader control in Power Apps

Scans barcodes, QR codes, and data-matrix codes on Android, iOS, and Windows devices.

## Description

The control opens a native scanner on Android, iOS, and Windows devices. On iOS and Android, the scanner supports the following scanning modes:

- **Automatically scan** – A barcode is scanned as soon as it's detected.
- **Select to scan** – The user can determine which of the detected barcodes to scan. The control doesn't support scanning in a web browser.
- **Scan multiple** – The user can scan multiple barcodes during the barcode session.

On Windows devices, the barcode reader will always **automatically scan**.

The barcode reader control supports different zoom levels and turning on/off the device's flashlight from within the scanning experience.

> [!NOTE]
> The barcode scanner control is supported on Android, iOS, and Windows devices. All other platforms will show a warning stating that some features of the app won't work.

## Key properties

**Barcodes** – Output property that contains a table of the barcodes scanned with two columns: **Value**, and **Type**. **Value** is the text value of the code that was scanned, while **Type** is the type of the code that was scanned.

**OnScan** – Actions to perform when a barcode is successfully scanned.

**OnCancel** – Actions to perform when a barcode scan is canceled by the user.

**OnChange** - Actions to perform when a property on the barcode reader control is changed, including output properties.

**BarcodeType** - The barcode type to scan. You can target multiple barcode types by concatenating them. Ex. `'Microsoft.BarcodeReader.BarcodeType'.Code128 & 'Microsoft.BarcodeReader.BarcodeType'.Code39`.  **Default: Auto**

**Scanning mode** - Whether to `Automatically scan` the first barcode detected in view, to allow the user to `Select to scan` which of the barcodes in view to scan, or to `Scan multiple` barcodes in a single session. On Windows, the barcode reader will always `Automatically scan`.

**Scanning quality** - The image quality the barcode reader scans at. A higher quality is good for small barcodes, but could lead to slow performance. On Windows, the barcode reader will always scan at the device's camera quality. **Default: Automatic**.

**PreferFrontCamera** - If enabled the barcode reader will default to using the front facing camera instead of the rear facing camera.

**BeepOnScan** - If enabled, the barcode reader will play a beep noise when a barcode is scanned.

**VibrateOnScan** - If enabled, the barcode reader will vibrate when a barcode is scanned.

## Additional properties

**Text** - Text that appears on the button that activates the scanner.

**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md)** – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The height of the button that activates the scanner.

**[Tooltip](properties-core.md)** – Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

**[Visible](properties-core.md)** – Whether a control appears or is hidden.

**[Width](properties-size-location.md)** – The width of the button that activates the scanner.

**[X](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen, if no parent container).

**[Y](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen, if no parent container).

## Accessibility guidelines

The same guidelines for the **[Button](control-button.md)** control apply to the **Barcode reader** control because it's a button that launches the scan.

### Visual alternatives

* The barcode scanner is a button that doesn't display the scan result. Consider showing the scan result with a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control. Set the label's **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to `First(BarcodeReader.Barcodes).Value` where `BarcodeReader` is the name of the barcode reader control. Set the label's **[Live](properties-accessibility.md)** property to **Polite** so that screen-reader users are notified of changes. This change makes the scanned value accessible to everyone, irrespective of visual ability.

* Users who have visual and motor disabilities might prefer not to point the camera at a barcode. Consider adding another form of input, such as a **[Text input](control-text-input.md)** control, for users to enter barcodes.
