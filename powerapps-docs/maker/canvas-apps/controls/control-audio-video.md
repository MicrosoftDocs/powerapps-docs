# Audio and Video controls in Power Apps
A control that plays an audio file, a video file, or a video on YouTube.

## Description

## Accessibility guidelines
### Audio and video alternatives
* **ShowControls** must be true so that users can listen or watch multimedia at their own pace. This also allows users to toggle closed captions and full-screen mode on video players.
* Closed captions must be provided for videos.
  *  For YouTube videos, use authoring tools provided by YouTube to add captions.
  *  For other videos, create captions in WebVTT format, upload them, and set **ClosedCaptionsUrl** to the url location. There are several limitations. Server(s) hosting video and captions needs to be CORS-enabled and serve them using HTTPS protocol. Captioning does not work on Internet Explorer.
* Consider providing an audio or video transcript using one of these methods:
  1. Put the text in a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** and position it adjacent to the multimedia player. Optionally, create a **[Button](control-button.md)** to toggle the display of the text.
  2. Put the text in a different screen. Create a **[Button](control-button.md)** that navigates to the screen and position the button adjacent to the multimedia player.
  3. If the description is short, it can be put it in the **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)**.

### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and the outside color
* **[Image](properties-visual.md)** and the multimedia player controls (if applicable)
* **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** and the multimedia player controls (if the fill is visible)

Provide closed captions and/or transcript if the video content has color contrast issues.

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
* **AutoStart** should be false because it can be difficult for keyboard users to stop playback quickly.
