# Camera control in Power Apps

A control that enables users to take pictures using the camera on a device.

## Description

Use the **Camera** control to capture pictures with a device's camera.  The device must have a camera and the user must authorize the app to use the camera.  The camera control is supported when running in a web browser.

The most recently captured picture is available through the **Photo** property.  With this property images can be:

- **Viewed with the Image control.**  Use the [**Image**](control-image.md) control to view the captured image.  See the [**examples**](#examples) for more details.  
- **Temporarily put in a variable or a collection.**  Use the [**Set**](../functions/function-set.md) or [**Collect**](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md) functions to store images in a variable or a collection.  Be careful with how many images you hold in a collection at the same time as they can be large and the device's memory can be limited.  Use the [**SaveData**](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) and [**LoadData**](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) functions to move images to the local storage on the device and for [offline scenarios](../offline-apps.md).
- **Stored in a database.**  Use the [**Patch**](../functions/function-patch.md) function to store images in a database.
- **Transmitted as a base64 encoded text string.**  Use the [**JSON**](../functions/function-json.md) function to base64 encode images.

Use the **Stream**, **StreamRate**, and **OnStream** properties to automatically capture images on a timer, for example snapping a picture every minute to create a time-lapse sequence.

Captured media is referenced by a text string URI. For more information, read the [data type documentation](../functions/data-types.md#uris-for-images-and-other-media).

Images generated by the camera control aren't usually in the full resolution of the camera. If you need full resolution images, use the [Add picture](control-add-picture.md) control.

## Key properties

**Camera** – On a device that has more than one camera, the numeric ID of the camera that the app uses.

**OnStream** – How the app responds when the **Stream** property is updated.

**Photo** – The image captured when the user takes a picture. 

**Stream** – Automatically updated image based on the **StreamRate** property.

**StreamRate** – How often to update the image on the **Stream** property, in milliseconds. This value can range from 100 (1/10th of a second) to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

## Additional properties

[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md) – Label for screen readers. Should describe the purpose of taking a picture.

[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md) – The color of a control's border.

[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md) – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md) – The thickness of a control's border.

**Brightness** – How much light the user is likely to perceive in an image.

**Contrast** – How easily the user can distinguish between similar colors in an image.

[DisplayMode](properties-core.md) – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md) – The color of a control's border when the control is focused.

[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md) – The thickness of a control's border when the control is focused.

[Height](properties-size-location.md) – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

[OnSelect](properties-core.md) – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md) – Keyboard navigation order compared to other controls.

[Tooltip](properties-core.md) – Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

[Visible](properties-core.md) – Whether a control appears or is hidden.

[Width](properties-size-location.md) – The distance between a control's left and right edges.

[X](properties-size-location.md) – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container or screen.

[Y](properties-size-location.md) – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container or screen.

## Examples

For these examples, you will need a device with a camera.  You can test your app with either a web cam accessible from your browser or by saving your app and loading it into an iOS or Andriod device with a camera.

### Simple display of a captured picture

1. [Add](../add-configure-controls.md) a **Camera** control.  y default it will be named **Camera1**; you will need to adjust the formula that follows if it is different.

1. If prompted, authorize the use of your device's camera in order to test your app while authoring.

1. Add an **Image** control.

1. Set the **Image** property of the **Image** control to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Camera1.Photo
    ```

1. Press F5 to preview your app.

1. Take a picture by selecting or tapping the camera control.  You should see the result in your image control.

### Add pictures to an Image gallery control

1. Add a **Camera** control, name it **MyCamera**, and set its [OnSelect](properties-core.md) property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Collect( MyPix, MyCamera.Photo )
    ```

    For more information:

    - [How to add, name, and configure a control?](../add-configure-controls.md)
    - Read more about [Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md) function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md).

1. Press F5, and then take a picture by selecting or tapping **MyCamera**.

1. Add a [Vertical gallery](control-gallery.md) control. And then resize its [Image](control-image.md) control, its template, and the **Image gallery** control itself to fit in the screen.

1. Set the [Items](properties-core.md) property of the **Image gallery** control to this formula:
 
    ```powerapps-dot
    MyPix
    ```

1. Set the [Image](properties-visual.md) property of the **Image** control in the gallery to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot   
    ThisItem.Url
    ```

    The picture that you took appears in the **Image gallery** control.

1. Take as many pictures as you want, and then return to the default workspace by pressing Esc.

1. (optional) Set the **OnSelect** property of the **Image** control in the **Image gallery** control to the formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Remove( MyPix, ThisItem )
    ```

1. Ppress F5, and then select a picture to remove it.

Use the [SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) function to save the pictures locally or the [Patch](../functions/function-patch.md) function to update a data source.

## Accessibility guidelines

The camera control shows camera feed and also functions as a button that takes a picture. So, there are similar accessibility considerations as with buttons.

### Video alternatives

Consider adding an alternative form of input for users with visual disabilities. For example, [Add picture](control-add-picture.md) to allow users to upload an image from their device.

### Color contrast

There must be adequate color contrast between [FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md) and the outside color.

### Screen reader support

[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md) must be present.

### Keyboard support

- [TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md) must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.

- Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use [FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md) and [FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md) to update the visibility of focus indicators.
