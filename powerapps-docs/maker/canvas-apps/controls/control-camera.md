# Camera control in Power Apps
A control with which the user can take photos by using the camera on the device.

## Description
If you add this control, the user can update a data source with one or more photos from wherever the app is running. Images generated by the camera control are not full resolution of the camera.  If you need full resolution images please consider the **[Add picture](control-add-picture.md)** control.

## Key properties
**Camera** – On a device that has more than one camera, the numeric ID of the camera that the app uses.

## Additional properties
**[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** – Label for screen readers. Should describe the purpose of taking a picture.

**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md)** – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**Brightness** – How much light the user is likely to perceive in an image.

**Contrast** – How easily the user can distinguish between similar colors in an image.

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

**OnStream** – How the app responds when the **Stream** property is updated.

**Photo** – The image captured  when the user takes a picture.

**Stream** – Automatically updated image based on the **StreamRate** property.

**StreamRate** – How often to update the image on the **Stream** property, in milliseconds.  This value can range from 100 (1/10th of a second) to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

**[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** – Keyboard navigation order in relation to other controls.

**[Tooltip](properties-core.md)** – Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

**[Visible](properties-core.md)** – Whether a control appears or is hidden.

**[Width](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's left and right edges.

**[X](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).

## Example
### Add photos to an Image gallery control
1. Add a **Camera** control, name it **MyCamera**, and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **Collect(MyPix, MyCamera.Photo)**

    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

    Want more information about the **[Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?
2. Press F5, and then take a photo by clicking or tapping **MyCamera**.
3. Add an **[Vertical gallery](control-gallery.md)** control, and then resize its **[Image](control-image.md)** control, its template, and the **Image gallery** control itself to fit in the screen.
4. Set the **[Items](properties-core.md)** property of the **Image gallery** control to:<br>**MyPix**.
5. Set the **[Image](properties-visual.md)** property of the **Image** control in the gallery to this expression:<br>
   **ThisItem.Url**

    The photo that you took appears in the **Image gallery** control.
6. Take as many photos as you want, and then return to the default workspace by pressing Esc.
7. (optional) Set the **OnSelect** property of the **Image** control in the **Image gallery** control to **Remove(MyPix, ThisItem)**, press F5, and then click or tap a photo to remove it.

Use the **[SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md)** function to save the photos locally or the **[Patch](../functions/function-patch.md)** function to update a data source.


## Accessibility guidelines
In addition to showing the camera feed, the entire camera control also functions as a button that takes a picture. Thus, there are similar accessibility considerations as with buttons.

### Video alternatives
* Consider adding an alternative form of input for users with visual disabilities. For example, **[Add picture](control-add-picture.md)** to allow users to upload an image from their device.

### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and the outside color

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
