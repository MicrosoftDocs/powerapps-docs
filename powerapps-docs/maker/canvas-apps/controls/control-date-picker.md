# Date Picker control in Power Apps
A control that the user can click or tap to specify a date.

## Description
If you add a **Date Picker** control instead of a **[Text input](control-text-input.md)** control, you help ensure that the user specifies a date in the correct format.

## Key properties
**DefaultDate** – The initial value of a date control unless the user changes it.

**SelectedDate** – The date currently selected in a date control.  This date is represented in local time.

**Format** – The text format in which the control shows the date and the user specifies the date. You can set this property to **ShortDate** (default) or **LongDate** to format dates based on the **Language** property of this control. You can also set this property to an expression, such as **yyyy/mm/dd** if you want the same format regardless of language. For example:

* The control shows **12/31/2017** if the user clicks or taps the last day of 2017, the **Format** property is set to **ShortDate**, and the **Language** property is set to **en-us**.
* The control shows **dimanche 31 decembre 2017** if the user clicks or taps the last day of 2017, the **Format** property is set to **LongDate**, and the **Language** property is set to **fr-fr**.

**Language** – Determines the language that's used to format dates, including names of months. If this property isn't specified, the user's device setting determines the language. Supported values include "EN-us" and "FR".

## Additional properties
**[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** – Label for screen readers.

**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md)** – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**[Color](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of text in a control.

**DateTimeZone** – Whether to display the date in **UTC** or the user's **Local** time.

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (Edit), only displays data (View), or is disabled (Disabled).

**[DisabledBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border if the control's **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[DisabledColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of text in a control if its **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[DisabledFill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control if its **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**EndYear** – The latest year to which the user can set value of a date-picker control.

**[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control.

**[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border when the control is focused.

**[Font](properties-text.md)** – The name of the family of fonts in which text appears.

**[FontWeight](properties-text.md)** – The weight of the text in a control: **Bold**, **Semibold**, **Normal**, or **Lighter**.

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**IconFill** – The foreground color of a the date picker icon.

**IconBackground** – The background color of a the date picker icon.

**InputTextPlaceholder** – Instructional text that appears if no dates are entered.

**IsEditable** – Whether the datepicker text can be edited. If false, the date can only be changed by using the calendar.

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

**[OnChange](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user changes the value of a control. 

Difference between **OnChange** and **OnSelect**: OnSelect and OnChange trigger on the same user action if the user's *click* causes the change. In this case, OnSelect triggers **before** OnChange.

**[PaddingBottom](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the bottom edge of that control.

**[PaddingLeft](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the left edge of that control.

**StartOfWeek** – The day of the week to display in the first day column of the date-picker control.

**StartYear** – The earliest year to which the user can set the value of a date-picker control.

## Example
1. Add a **Date Picker** control, and name it **Deadline**.

    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?
2. Add a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control, and set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:
   <br>**DateDiff(Today(), Deadline.SelectedDate) & " days to go!"**

    Want more information about the **[DateDiff](../functions/function-dateadd-datediff.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?
3. Press F5, choose a date in **Deadline**, and then click or tap **OK**.

    The **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control shows the number of days between today and the date that you chose.
4. To return to the default workspace, press Esc.


## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
* [Standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md) apply.

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.

> [!TIP]
> When the calendar is open, press **Page up** and **Page down** to navigate between months and **Shift+Page up** and **Shift+Page down** to navigate between years.
