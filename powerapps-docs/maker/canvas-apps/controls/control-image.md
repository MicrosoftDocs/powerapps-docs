# Image control in Power Apps
A control that shows an image from, for example, a local file or a data source.

## Description
If you add one or more **Image** controls to your app, you can show individual images that aren't part of a data set, or you can incorporate images from records in data sources.

## Examples
### Show an image from a local file
1. On the **File** menu, click or tap **Media**, and then click or tap **Browse**.
2. Click or tap the image file that you want to add, click or tap **Open**, and then press Esc to return to the default workspace.
3. Add an **Image** control, and set its **Image** property to the name of the file that you added.

    Don't know how to [add and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

    The **Image** control shows the image that you specified.

### Show a set of images from a data source
1. Download this [Excel file](https://pwrappssamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/FlooringEstimates.xlsx), and save it on your local device.
2. In Power Apps Studio, create or open an app, and then click or tap **Add data source** in the right-hand pane.

    If **Add data source** doesn't appear in the right-hand pane, click or tap a screen in the left navigation bar.
3. Click or tap **Add static data to your app**, click or tap the Excel file that you downloaded, and then click or tap **Open**.
4. Select the **Flooring Estimates** check box, and then click or tap **Connect**.
5. Add a **Gallery** control with images, and set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to **FlooringEstimates**.

    Don't know how to [add and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

    The **Gallery** control shows images of carpet, hardwood, and tile products based on links in the Excel file that you downloaded.


## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
* [Standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md) apply, if the graphic is used as a button.
* Consider checking for contrast issues within the image, if it is not purely decorative.

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present, if the graphic is used as a button or is otherwise not just for decoration.
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be empty or the empty string **""**, if the graphic is purely for decoration. This causes screen readers to ignore the graphic.
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** can be empty or the empty string **""**, if the graphic provides redundant information.
  * For example, an **Image** of gears with its **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** set to **Settings**. This image is not used as a button. It is next to a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** that also says **Settings**. Screen readers will read the image as **Settings**, and the label as **Settings** again. This is unnecessarily verbose. In this case, the **Image** does not need an **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Screen readers will always read **Image**s that have **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** of zero or greater, even if **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** is empty. This is because they are rendered as buttons. If no **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** is provided, screen readers will simply read the graphic as **button**.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater, if the graphic is used as a button. This allows keyboard users to navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible, if the graphic is used as a button. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.

    > [!NOTE]
  > When **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** is zero or greater, the **Image** is rendered as a button. There is no change to the visual appearance, but screen readers will correctly identify the image as a button. When **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** is less than zero, the **Image** is identified as an image.
