# HTML text control in Power Apps
A box that shows text and converts HTML tags to formatting.

## Description
An **HTML text** control not only shows plain text and numbers but also converts HTML tags, such as non-breaking spaces.

**[Font](properties-text.md)** – The name of the family of fonts in which text appears.

## Additional properties
**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[DisabledBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border if the control's **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[DisabledFill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control if its **[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** property is set to **Disabled**.

**[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** – The background color of a control.

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**[HoverBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border when the user keeps the mouse pointer on that control.

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

**[PaddingBottom](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between text in a control and the bottom edge of that control.

## Example
1. Add a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control, name it **Source**, and set its **[Text](properties-core.md)** property to this string:

"\<p>We've\&nbsp;done an unusually \&quot;deep\&quot; globalization and localization.\<p>"

Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

1. Add an **HTML text** control, and set its **HtmlText** property to this value:<br>
   **Source.Text**
   
     The **HTML text** control shows the same text as the **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control but converts the tags to the appropriate characters.


## Accessibility guidelines
**HTML text** is not meant to be interactive. It should only be used for text display.

### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **[Color](properties-color-border.md)** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**
* Text with custom colors and its background

### Screen reader support
* **HtmlText** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **HtmlText** should not contain interactive elements like `<button>`, `<a>`, or `<input>`. The **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** system in Power Apps does not consider elements inside **HtmlText**.
