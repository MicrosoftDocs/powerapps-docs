# Drop down control in Power Apps
A list that shows only the first item unless the user opens it.

## Description
A **Drop down** control conserves screen real estate, especially when the list contains a large number of choices. The control takes up only one line unless the user selects the chevron to reveal more choices.  The control will show a maximum of 500 items.

## Key properties
**[Default](properties-core.md)** – The initial value of a control before the user specifies a different value.

**[Items](properties-core.md)** – The source of data that contains the items that appear in the control. If the source has multiple columns, set the control's **Value** property to the column of data that you want to show.
  
**Value** – The column of data that you want to show in the control (for example, if a data source has multiple columns).

**Selected** – The data record that represents the selected item.

**AllowEmptySelection** – Whether the control shows an empty selection if no item has been selected. App users can also clear their choices by selecting the blank item.

## Example

### Simple list

1. Add a **Drop down** control, and then set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to this expression:

    `["Seattle", "Tokyo", "London", "Johannesburg", "Rio de Janeiro"]`

    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

1. Show the items in the list by selecting the control's down arrow while pressing the Alt key.

### List from a data source
The principles in this procedure apply to any [data source that provides tables](../connections-list.md#tables) but, to follow these steps exactly, you must open an environment for which a Microsoft Dataverse database has been created and sample data added.

1. [Open a blank app](../data-platform-create-app-scratch.md#open-a-blank-app), and then [specify the **Accounts** entity](../data-platform-create-app-scratch.md#specify-an-entity).

1. Add a **Drop down** control, and set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    `Distinct(Accounts, address1_city)`

    This formula shows all the cities in the **Accounts** entity. If more than one record has the same city, the **[Distinct](../functions/function-distinct.md)** function hides the duplication in your drop-down control.

1. (optional) Rename your **Drop down** control to **Cities**, add a vertical **Gallery** control, and set the gallery's **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    `Filter(Accounts, address1_city = Cities.Selected.Value)`

    This **[Filter](../functions/function-filter-lookup.md)** function shows only those records in the **Accounts** entity for which the city matches the selected value in the **Cities** control.

## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **ChevronFill** and **ChevronBackground**
* **ChevronHoverFill** and **ChevronHoverBackground**
* **SelectionColor** and **SelectionFill**
* **SelectionFill** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**

This is in addition to the [standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md).

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
