# Attachments control in Power Apps

A control that allows users to download files to their device, as well as upload and delete files from a list created using Microsoft Lists, or a Microsoft Dataverse table.

## Limitations

The attachment control has these limitations:

1. The attachment control only supports lists and Dataverse tables as the data sources.

1. Upload and delete functionality work only inside a form. The Attachment control appears disabled when in Edit mode and not inside a form. To save file additions and deletions, the app user must save the form. Because of this limitation, the Attachment control isn't available from the **Insert** tab but appears in the form when the Attachment form field is enabled in a SharePoint or Dataverse form.

1. Attachments control on a web browser lets you select multiple files, and allows use of drag and drop functionality. However, when using attachments control on [Power Apps Mobile](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/downloads/), you can only add files one at a time.
