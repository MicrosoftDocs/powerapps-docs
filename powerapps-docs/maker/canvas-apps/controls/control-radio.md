## Example

1. Add a **Radio** control, name it **Pricing**, and set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:

    **["Standard", "Premium"]**

    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

2. Add a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control, move it below the **Radio** control, and set the **[Text](properties-core.md)** property of the **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control to this formula:

    **If("Premium" in Pricing.Selected.Value, "$200 per day", "$150 per day")**

    Want more information about the **[If](../functions/function-if.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?

3. While holding down the Alt key, select either option in the **Radio** control.

    The **[Label](control-text-box.md)** control shows the appropriate text for your choice.

4. (optional) While holding down the Alt key, select the other option to confirm that the appropriate text appears.

## Accessibility guidelines

### Color contrast

In addition to the [standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md), ensure adequate color contrast between:

* **RadioSelectionFill** and **RadioBackgroundFill**
* **RadioBackgroundFill** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**

### Screen-reader support

* Ensure that every option has a **[Value](properties-core.md)**.
* Consider adding a **[Label](control-text-box.md)** immediately before the **Radio** control to serve as the heading.

### Keyboard support

* Set the **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** property to zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Set the **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** properties so that focus indicators are clearly visible.
