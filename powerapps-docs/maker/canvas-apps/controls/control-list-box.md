# List Box control in Power Apps
A list in which the user can select one or multiple items.

## Description
A **List Box** control always shows all available choices (unlike a **[Drop down](control-drop-down.md)** control) and in which the user can choose more than one item at a time (unlike a **[Radio](control-radio.md)** control).

## Key properties
**[Default](properties-core.md)** – The initial value of a control before it is changed by the user.

**[Items](properties-core.md)** – The source of data that appears in a control such as a gallery, a list, or a chart.

**Selected** – The data record that represents the selected item.  You can only have one default selected item.  If you need multiple selected items please use the [Combo Box](control-combo-box.md) control.

When you add a gallery, a list, or a chart, the property list shows **Items** by default so that you can easily specify the data that the new control should show. For example, you might set the **Items** property of a gallery to the **Account** table in Salesforce, a table named **Inventory** that you created in Excel and uploaded to the cloud, or a SharePoint list named **ConferenceSpeakers**.

## Accessibility guidelines
### Color contrast
There must be adequate color contrast between:
* **SelectionColor** and **SelectionFill**
* **SelectionFill** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**
* **[HoverFill](properties-color-border.md)** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**
* **[PressedFill](properties-color-border.md)** and **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)**

This is in addition to the [standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md).

### Screen reader support
* **[AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md)** must be present.

### Keyboard support
* **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** must be zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* Focus indicators must be clearly visible. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.

    > [!NOTE]
  > The tab key navigates to or away from the **List box**. Arrow keys navigate the contents of the **List box**.
