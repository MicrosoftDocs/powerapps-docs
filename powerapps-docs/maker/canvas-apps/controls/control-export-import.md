# Export control and Import control in Power Apps
Controls for exporting data to a local file and then importing that data into another app in Power Apps.

## Description
If you want to create more than one app that uses the same data but not share that data outside those apps, you can export it and import it by using an **Export** control and an **Import** control. When you export data, you create a compressed file that you can copy to another machine, but you can't read it in any program other than Power Apps.

## Warning
Enabling this functionality in your app may expose it to security vulnerabilities and data leakage.  It is recommended to advise users to import only recognized and trusted files and only export data that is not confidential or sensitive.

## Limitations
The export functionality isn't supported in web browsers.

## Key properties
**Data** – The name of a collection that you want to export to a local file.

* The **Data** property is available for an **Export** control but not an **Import** control.

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

## Example
1. Add a **[Button](control-button.md)** control, and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula: <br>
   ```
   ClearCollect(Products, {Name:"Europa", Price:"10.99"}, {Name:"Ganymede", Price:"12.49"}, {Name:"Callisto", Price:"11.79"})
   ```
   For more details, read [adding, naming, and configuring a control](../add-configure-controls.md), **[ClearCollect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** and [other functions](../formula-reference.md).
2. Press F5 and select **[Button](control-button.md)** control, and then press Esc.
3. Add an **Export** control, and set its **Data** property to **Products**.
4. Press F5 and select the **Export** control to download the file *Data.zip*.
5. Select **Save**, then press Esc to return to the default workspace.
6. In a new or existing app, add an **Import** control, name it **MyData**, and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
   **Collect(ImportedProducts, MyData.Data)**
7. Press F5 and select **MyData**, then select the file that you exported, and then select **Open**.
8. Press Esc and select **Collections** on the **File** menu, and confirm that the current app has the data that you exported.


## Accessibility guidelines
The same guidelines for **[Button](control-button.md)**  apply because **Export** and **Import** are just specialized buttons.
