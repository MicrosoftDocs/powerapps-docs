# Add picture control in Power Apps
Takes a photo or loads images from the local device.

## Description
With this control users can take photos or upload image files from their device and update the data source with this content. On a mobile device the user is presented with the device's choice dialog to choose between taking a photo or selecting one already available.

This control is a grouped control containing two controls: an **Image** and an **Add picture button**. The **Image** control shows the uploaded image or a placeholder if no image has been uploaded. The **Add picture button** prompts for an image to be uploaded.

## Examples
### Add images to an Image gallery control
1. Add an **Add picture** control, and then triple-click it.
   
    Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?
1. In the **Open** dialog box, click or tap an image file, and then click or tap **Open**.
1. Add a **[Button](control-button.md)** control, move it under the **Add picture** control, and set the **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property for the **[Button](control-button.md)** control to this formula:<br>
   **Collect(MyPix, AddMediaButton1.Media)**
   
    Want more information about the **[Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?
1. Add a **Vertical gallery** control, and set its **[Items](properties-core.md)** property to **MyPix**.
1. Select the **[Image](control-image.md)** control in the gallery and set it's **Image** property to **ThisItem.Value**.
1. Press F5, and then click or tap the **[Button](control-button.md)** control.
   
    The image from the **Add picture** control appears in the **Vertical allery** control. If your image doesn't have the same aspect ratio as the **[Image](control-image.md)** control in the **Vertical gallery** control, set the **[ImagePosition](properties-visual.md)** property of the **[Image](control-image.md)** control to **Fit**.
1. Click or tap the **Add picture** control, click or tap another image file, click or tap **Open**, and then click or tap the **[Button](control-button.md)** control that you added.
   
    The second image appears in the **Image gallery** control.
1. (optional) Repeat the previous step one or more times, and then return to the default workspace by pressing Esc.

Use the **[SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md)** function to save the images locally or the **[Patch](../functions/function-patch.md)** function to update a data source.


## Accessibility guidelines
The same guidelines for **[Button](control-button.md)** and **[Image](control-image.md)** apply. In addition, consider the following:

### Color contrast
* **Add picture button** must have adequate contrast between its text and background. Since the uploaded image may have varying colors, use an opaque **[Fill](properties-color-border.md)** on the **Add picture button** to ensure consistent contrast.

### Screen reader support
* **Add picture button** must have **Text** and **ChangePictureText** that prompts the user to add or change a picture.

### Keyboard support
* **Add picture button** must have **[TabIndex](properties-accessibility.md)** of zero or greater so that keyboard users can navigate to it.
* **Add picture button** must have clearly visible focus indicators. Use **[FocusedBorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** and **[FocusedBorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** to achieve this.
