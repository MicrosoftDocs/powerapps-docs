# Microphone control in Power Apps

A control that enables app users to record sounds from their device.

## Description

Use the **Microphone** control to capture audio with a device's microphone. The device must have a microphone and the user must authorize the app to use the microphone. 

The most recently recorded audio clip is available through the **Audio** property. With this property, recorded audio can be:

- **Played back with the Audio control.**  Use the [Audio](control-audio-video.md) control to listen to the recording. For more information, see the [examples](#examples).
- **Temporarily put in a variable or a collection.**  Use the [Set](../functions/function-set.md) or [Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md) functions to store audio clips in a variable or a collection.  Use caution with multiple audio clips in a collection at the same time with device's limited memory.  Use the [SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) and [LoadData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) functions to move audio clips to the local storage on the device and for [offline scenarios](../offline-apps.md).
- **Stored in a database.**  Use the [Patch](../functions/function-patch.md) function to store audio clips in a database.
- **Transmitted as a base64 encoded text string.**  Use the [JSON](../functions/function-json.md) function to base64 encode audio clips.

Format of the recorded audio:

- *3gp* format for *Android*.
- *AAC* format for *iOS*.
- *OGG* format for *web browsers*.

Captured media is referenced by a text string URI. For more information, read the [data type documentation](../functions/data-types.md#uris-for-images-and-other-media).

> [!NOTE]
> The microphone control is supported only on Microsoft Edge based on Chromium, Chrome, and Firefox browsers; and Android and iOS devices. All other browsers and platforms will show a warning that some features of the app won't work.

## Key properties

**Audio** – The audio clip captured when the user records with the device's microphone.

## Examples

### Simple direct playback

In this example, we'll directly connect a **Microphone** control with an **Audio** control for immediate playback:

1. [Add](../add-configure-controls.md) a **Microphone** control to your app.
1. Authorize the app to use device's microphone if prompted.
1. Add an **Audio** control to your app.
1. Set the **Audio** control's **Media** property to the formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Microphone1.Audio
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace microphone control name *Microphone1* as appropriate.

1. Preview the app.
1. Select the **Microphone** control to begin recording.
1. Speak to record audio.
1. Select the **Microphone** control again to end the recording.
1. Select the **Audio** control to hear the recording.  

### Add sounds to a Gallery control

In this example, we'll create a gallery of audio clips stored in a collection that can be individually selected for playback:

1. [Add](../add-configure-controls.md) a **Microphone** control.

1. Set its **OnStop** property to this formula using the [Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md) function:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Collect( MySounds, MyMic.Audio )
    ```

1. Add a **Gallery** control, move it below **MyMic**.

1. Set the [Items](properties-core.md) property for the gallery to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    MySounds
    ```

1. In the template for the **Custom gallery** control, add an [Audio](control-audio-video.md) control.

1. Set the audio control's **Media** property to this formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    ThisItem.Url
    ```

1. Press F5 to preview the app.

1. Select **MyMic** to start recording, and then select it again to stop recording.

1. In the **Gallery** control, select the play button in the **Audio** control to play back your recording.

1. Add as many recordings as you want, and then return to the default workspace by pressing the Esc key.

1. (optional) In the template for the **Gallery** control, add a [Button](control-button.md) control.

1. Set its [OnSelect](properties-core.md) property to the formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Remove( MySounds, ThisItem )
    ```

1. Press F5, and then remove a recording by selecting the corresponding **Button** control.

Use the [SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md) function to save the recordings locally or the [Patch](../functions/function-patch.md) function to update a data source.

## Accessibility guidelines

The same guidelines for [Button](control-button.md)  apply because **Microphone** is just a specialized button. Also, consider:

### Audio alternatives

Consider adding an alternative form of input for users with speech disabilities or without a microphone. For example, [Text input](control-text-input.md) to allow users to enter text.

### Color contrast

- Read the [standard color contrast requirements](../accessible-apps-color.md).
- Ensure adequate color contrast between [Image](properties-visual.md) and the button text and icon (if applicable).

### Screen reader support

- [AccessibleLabel](properties-accessibility.md) must be present.
