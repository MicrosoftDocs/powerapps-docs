# Get started with Power Apps 

The [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) home page offers you various options for creating your own apps, opening apps that you or others have created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the license or licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities like creating custom connections to specific data sources.

## 1 – Left navigation pane 

Find what you need with the new left navigation pane. If this is the first time, you're signing in to the [Power Apps home page](https://make.powerapps.com) the left navigation pane will show the following menu items:

Legend:

1. **Home**: Takes you to the Power Apps home page.
2. **Create**: Create apps as such as [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/), [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/), [chatbots](/powerapps/chatbots), and [AI models](/powerapps/use-ai-builder).
3. **Learn**: The [learn hub](../common/learn-hub.md) lets you explore documents, training material, get help from the Power Apps community, and other resources that will help you to create and build Power Apps.
4. **Apps**: If you've created an app or someone else has created one and shared it with you, you can play or edit it. You can also filter the list of apps based on criteria such as whether you opened it recently.
5. **Your most used pages such as Tables, Connections, Flows**: When you first sign in to the new navigation experience the top three pages that you use most are pinned to the left navigation pane. Use the **More** option to unpin any of these pages and pin something else.
6. **More**: Pin your most used items to the left navigation such as tables, flows, and more.
7. **Power Platform**: Explore other Power Platform products or service.

### Pin and unpin

Pin your most used pages in the navigation pane so you can quickly access features that you use frequently. Links to other pages are available through the **More** link. When you pin an item, it appears in the middle section above **More**. 

When you sign in to the new navigation experience, the system will automatically pin your most and recently used pages on the left navigation pane. However, you can pin and unpin pages and customize it to your preference.

## 4 – Build apps

Start building apps, which provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes. 

In Power Apps, you can create and run these types of apps:

- **Canvas apps** support designing custom UI and connecting to data from various sources.
- **Model-driven apps** have a standard UI and connect to data only in Dataverse. However, you can more easily create other elements such as views, dashboards, and different types of business logic.
- **Cards** (preview) are micro-apps with enterprise data and workflows and interactive, lightweight UI elements that other applications can use as content.

In addition, Power Apps also allows you to create Power Pages websites. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction).

If you choose an [environment that has a Dataverse database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database), you can build canvas or model-driven apps from the same **Home** page.

From the **Home** page, you can create apps, websites, chatbots, and AI models:

- [Get started with canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/)
- [Get started with model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/)
- [Get started with chatbots](/powerapps/chatbots)
- [Get started with AI models](/powerapps/use-ai-builder)

## 5 – Ask a virtual agent
