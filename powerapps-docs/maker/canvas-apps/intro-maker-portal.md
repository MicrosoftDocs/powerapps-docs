# Get started with Power Apps

The [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) home page offers various options for creating your own apps, opening apps that you or others created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities like creating custom connections to specific data sources.

If your organization enables AI, the home page also includes the new [Copilot](ai-overview.md) features.

Select the appropriate tab in the following section to learn more.

## 6 – Build apps

**Ready to build your first app?** Choose the option that best fits your needs:

**For beginners:** Start with Copilot or use a template
**For specific data:** Connect to Excel or Dataverse  
**For custom solutions:** Start with a blank canvas

To create an app, select **Create** and then choose from these options:

- **Start with Copilot**: [Build apps through conversation](ai-conversations-create-app.md).
- **Start with data**: [Create a canvas app using Microsoft Dataverse](data-platform-create-app-scratch.md) or [Create a canvas app based on Excel data](get-started-create-from-blank.md).
- **Start with a blank app**: [Create a blank canvas app from scratch](create-blank-app.md).
- **Start with a page design**: Select the type of app you want to create. Use the **Filter** option in the top-right to narrow templates by app type or features like offline use, responsive design, or embedding into other Microsoft 365 products. For more information, see [Overview of creating apps in Power Apps](../index.md).
- **Start with an app template**: Choose from app templates, including data-centered templates for mobile apps. For more information, see [Create a canvas app from a template](get-started-test-drive.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  >  If you're trying to create an app by using Dataverse but the option is unavailable, review the [permissions table](#permissions-for-dataverse) in this article.

- **Apps**: On the **Home** page, find the apps that you own or apps that are shared with you. You can also filter and sort apps quickly to find the app you're looking for. Hover over the app name to **Edit**, **Play**, or select **Commands** to perform various actions such as share the app, view app details, and access app settings.
