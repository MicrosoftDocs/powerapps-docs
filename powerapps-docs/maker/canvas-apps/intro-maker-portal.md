# Get started with Power Apps

The [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) home page offers you various options for creating your own apps, opening apps that you or others have created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the license or licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities like creating custom connections to specific data sources.


A new version of the home page is being rolled out which provides a better app creation experience. If your organization has AI enabled then it also includes the new [Copilot](ai-overview.md) features. The new look is on by default. However, you can turn it off by using the toggle on the top-right corner of the home page.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![New look](media/intro-maker-portal/new-look-toggle.png "New look toggle")

Select the appropriate tab below to know more.

## 1 – Left navigation pane

Find what you need with the left navigation pane. When you sign in to [Power Apps home page](https://make.powerapps.com) the left navigation pane shows the following menu items:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

Legend:

1. **Home**: Takes you to the Power Apps home page.
2. **Create**: Create apps as such as [canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/), [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/), [chatbots](/powerapps/chatbots), and [AI models](/powerapps/use-ai-builder).
3. **Learn**: The [learn hub](../common/learn-hub.md) lets you explore documents, training material, get help from the Power Apps community, and other resources that help you to create and build Power Apps.
4. **Apps**: If you've created an app or someone else has created one and shared it with you, you can play or edit it. You can also filter the list of apps based on criteria such as whether you opened it recently.
5. **Your most used pages such as Tables, Connections, Flows**: When you first sign in the top three pages that you use most are pinned to the left navigation pane. Use the **More** option to unpin any of these pages and pin something else.
6. **More**: Pin your most used items to the left navigation such as tables, flows, and more.
7. **Power Platform**: Explore other Power Platform products or service.

### Pin and unpin

Pin your most used pages in the navigation pane so you can quickly access features that you use frequently. Links to other pages are available through the **More** link. When you pin an item, it appears in the middle section above **More**.

When you sign in, the system automatically pins your most and recently used pages on the left navigation pane. However, you can pin and unpin pages and customize it to your preference.

To pin or unpin a page from the left navigation pane, select **More**, and then select the ![Pin button.](media/intro-maker-portal/pin-button.png) pin or ![Unpin button.](media/intro-maker-portal/unpin-button.png) unpin button.

## 4 – Build apps

Start building apps, which provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes.

Depending upon whether you have the new look turned on, select the appropriate tab below to know more.

# [New look (preview)](#tab/home-new-look)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

If your organization has [AI enabled](ai-overview.md) then you'll see AI assistant on the Power Apps Home screen. For more information, see [Build apps through conversation](ai-conversations-create-app.md).

To create an app, select from the following options:


- **Start with data**: Lets you upload an [Excel file](get-started-create-from-data.md), build your own table, select a [Dataverse table](data-platform-create-app.md), or choose from external data source such as [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md), [Excel](./connections/connection-excel.md), or [SQL](./connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase.md) to start building your app.
- **Choose a page template**: Select the type of app you want to create. You can also use the **Filter** option located in the top-right to narrow down templates by app type or features, such as offline use, responsive design, or embed into other Microsoft 365 products. More information: [Overview of creating apps in Power Apps](../index.md)
- **Pick an app template**: Choose from an app template including, data-centered templates for mobile apps. More information: [Create a canvas app from a template](get-started-test-drive.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  If you're trying to create an app using Dataverse but the option is unavailable, then review the [permissions table](#permissions-for-dataverse) below.

Furthermore, you can locate your top six apps under **Your apps**. You have the option to filter and sort them to quickly find the app you're searching for. Use the **Commands** button to perform various actions such as editing the app, viewing app details, and accessing settings.


### Permissions for Dataverse

The table summarizes scenarios and outcome when you create apps that require Microsoft Dataverse.


| **Maker has access to a developer environment** | **Maker has permission to create a developer environment** |  **Maker has access to another Dataverse environment with required permissions** | **Action** | 
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| Yes| n/a  | n/a  |  Switch to the developer environment that appears first in the alphabetical list |  
| No| Yes  | n/a | Create a developer environment | 
| No |No | Yes | Switch to another environment using the environment picker | 
| No|No| No | Contact your admin |

# [Classic](#tab/home-classic)

In Power Apps, you can create and run these types of apps:

- **Canvas apps** support designing custom UI and connecting to data from various sources.
- **Model-driven apps** have a standard UI and connect to data only in Dataverse. However, you can more easily create other elements such as views, dashboards, and different types of business logic.
- **Cards** (preview) are micro-apps with enterprise data and workflows and interactive, lightweight UI elements that other applications can use as content.

In addition, Power Apps also allows you to create Power Pages websites. More information: [What is Power Pages?](/power-pages/introduction)

If you choose an [environment that has a Dataverse database](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-with-a-database), you can build canvas or model-driven apps from the same **Home** page.

From the **Home** page, you can create apps, websites, chatbots, and AI models:

- [Get started with canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/)
- [Get started with model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/)
- [Get started with chatbots](/powerapps/chatbots)
- [Get started with AI models](/powerapps/use-ai-builder)
