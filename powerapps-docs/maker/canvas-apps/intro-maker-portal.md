# Get started with Power Apps

The [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) home page offers you various options for creating your own apps, opening apps that you or others have created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the license or licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities like creating custom connections to specific data sources.

If your organization has AI enabled then it also includes the new [Copilot](ai-overview.md) features.

Select the appropriate tab below to know more.

6. **More**: Pin your most used items to the left navigation such as tables, flows, and more.

To create an app, select from the following options:

- **Start with data**: Lets you upload an [Excel file](get-started-create-from-data.md), build your own table, select a [Dataverse table](data-platform-create-app.md), or choose from external data source such as [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md), [Excel](./connections/connection-excel.md), or [SQL](./connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase.md) to start building your app.
