# Create a canvas app from an image 

The app making journey typically involve a design phase to plan out what the app should look like. Whether the design is based on an existing paper form, a whiteboard drawing, or even an image of a legacy app, it can take a considerable amount of time to build the app from scratch.

With the **Image to app** feature, you can now create an app from a visual design and connect it to data through a few simple steps in the guided interface. This feature makes it easy for makers of all skill levels to jumpstart the app development process.


> [!NOTE]
> - The styling of the components in the app, such as fonts and colors, will be based on the **Office Blue** theme in Power Apps.
> - If you want the exact design styles to be preserved when you create your app, consider creating a [canvas app from Figma](figma/overview.md).
> - Power Apps doesn't persist the image that you upload. The uploaded image is only processed in-memory to generate the app.

## Prerequisites

- A Power Apps license. If you don't have a license for Power Apps, you can [sign-up for free](../signup-for-powerapps.md).
- If you're using your own image, the image file extension must be .jpg or .png. Also, the image must contain a clearly legible one-page form with a light background color. For the best results, edit your image so that it has a white background and high contrast.

## Create an app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. Select **+ Create** from the left-pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/select-create.png" alt-text="Select Create from the left-pane":::

1. Select **Image**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/select-image.png" alt-text="Select Image (preview) from the available cards.":::

1. Review the examples of recommended images and tips. For the best experience, make sure your image adheres to these recommendations. Once you’re done, select the **Next** button.

1. Enter a name for the app.

1. Upload your own image. If you don't have an image ready, you can also use one of the available sample images.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When using your own image, ensure the image meets the image requirements mentioned in [Image requirements](#image-requirements).

    For example, here are two sample images with acceptable and unacceptable qualities:

    | Acceptable quality | Unacceptable quality |
    | - | - |
    | :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/hand-drawn-good.png" alt-text="Example hand drawn image with acceptable quality."::: | :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/hand-drawn-bad.png" alt-text="Example hand drawn image with unacceptable quality."::: |

1. Based on the dimensions of your image, the format (Tablet or Phone) will be automatically selected for you. For the best results, we recommend that you keep the suggested format. Using the suggested format will ensure the closest match between your input image and the final app. Select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/choose-image.png" alt-text="Provide image name, image type, and layout.":::

1. Your image will be automatically tagged based on the components that were identified. For example, in the following sample image, the box that says “Enter your first name” was identified as a **Text input** control.

    You can draw a new tag by selecting and dragging to select the region that encompasses the component. Then, choose the type of component that you want to associate the new tag with.

    To make edits to an existing tag or to delete it, select the tag. You can then assign a different component for that tag, or adjust the dimensions of the tag by dragging the corners to change the size. If you'd like to remove the tag, select **Delete tag**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/design-components.png" alt-text="Design components for the app by selecting tags or creating a new tag and then choosing the tag control.":::

    > [!TIP]
    > Select the **Guidance** tab on the right-side of the screen to learn more about the different types of components and how to accurately tag each one.

    After you've reviewed the tags and ensured that each component is correctly tagged, select **Next**.

1. The next step is to set up data. For the best experience, we recommended that you connect your app to a data source by selecting **Create a new table in Dataverse**. If you choose this option and select **Next**, you'll be guided in the next stage to add columns based on the form fields in your image, and your app will contain a form component that is connected to your Dataverse table.

    If you don't want to create a new table in Dataverse, select **Skip this for now**. If you choose this option and select **Create**, your app will be created as-is, which means that the components you tagged in the previous step will be generated directly. They won't be placed into a form component, and your app won't be connected to data.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/setup-data.png" alt-text="Choose to create a new table, or continue without creating a table now.":::

    If you choose to skip the table creation, select **Create** and the app will be created for you. Later, you can add [data connections](connections-list.md) to your app to connect the app with your data.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The option to create a new table will be disabled if you don't have Dataverse in your environment, or if you don't have the required permissions to create a Dataverse table.

1. If you chose to create a new table in Dataverse, you can now edit the table and column details. Each tag corresponds to a data column based on the form fields that were identified in your image.

    Select a tag to modify the column properties, such as **Display Name**, **Name**, and **Data type**. To remove an existing column, select the tag and then select **Delete column**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/design-table.png" alt-text="Design the table, change columns and their properties.":::

    You can add a data column by drawing a new tag and setting the properties. When tagging columns, most of the time you'll draw a tag around two things: a label, and something the user will enter data into, like a text input.

    > [!TIP]
    > Select **Table properties** on the right-side of the screen to view and edit the properties for your new table.

    Upon selecting **Next**, you'll be able to review the table and column structure.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/review-table.png" alt-text="Review and confirm the table and column schema structure.":::

    Once you've completed the review, select **Create** to create the app. The app creation might take a minute or two.

1. Once the app is created, your new app will open up in Power Apps Studio so you can continue building and customizing your app.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/app-created.png" alt-text="The app has been created and opened in Power Apps Studio for you to customize.":::

    If you chose to create a new table in Dataverse, your form will be automatically connected to your new table.

    :::image type="content" source="media/app-from-image/data-source.png" alt-text="The table has been created and added to the app.":::

1. You can continue to build and customize your app by adding more components or modifying the style properties.

    Here are some common next steps to take your app to the next level:

    1. [Add a new screen](add-screen-context-variables.md) named **Screen2** to your app and a gallery to display the records. Set the data source of the gallery to your new Dataverse table.
    1. On the screen that contains your form, [add a button](add-form.md#edit-form-only-save-changes) (if you don't have one already) to submit the form data. Set the formula for the **OnSelect** property to `SubmitForm(Form1)`.
    1. Select the form, then select the **Advanced** tab on the right-side of the screen and set the property **OnSuccess** to `Navigate(Screen2)`. This way, after the form data is successfully submitted, the app will navigate to the screen that contains the gallery to display the records.
    1. Select **Play** on top-right side of the screen to preview your app. Fill in the form, and select **Submit** to submit the form. Your new record will appear in the gallery screen.

1. [Save and publish](save-publish-app.md) the app.

## Image requirements

- The image you want to upload must have the file extension of .jpg or .png. If you have a design image with another file extension, save the image file with .jpg or .png file extension in order to use it with this feature.
- Image size must be less than 4 MB.
- If you're using screenshots or digital sketches, alter the background to light, pure-color if white is not available.
- If you're taking a picture, use higher contrast or make it brighter. Make sure the part you want to tag is clear and bright.
- If you're taking a picture using a camera or phone, use higher contrast to favor light backgrounds. You can use any available photo editing apps to edit the picture contrast.
- If you're using hand-drawn images, try to use **white** sketch pad without any lines on it.
