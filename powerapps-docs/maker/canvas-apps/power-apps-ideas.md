# Power Apps Ideas


[Power Fx](/power-platform/power-fx/overview) is the open-source programming language for low code. It enables millions of people with Excel-like skills to add advanced logic to their apps. However, sometimes it's not easy to write a formula, even for the most experienced Power Fx users, as it can sometimes take a lot of time searching for, learning about, and debugging complex formulas.

Power Apps Ideas is created to help everyone from the new makers to the seasoned IT pros to ease and speed up the formula authoring experience by using the power of AI models.

If you’re struggling with Power Fx and don’t want to spend time on it, try Power Apps Ideas.

## Use Power Apps Ideas in your app


When you're building a canvas app, Power Apps Ideas will automatically suggest ideas for supported controls such as **Gallery**, **Data table**, **Text box**, **Drop down**, **Combo box**, and **Text label**. 

When you select the name field in a gallery, you'll see an idea for a formula that you may want to use. However, if you select the plus icon, then you won’t see an idea because we currently don’t have ideas for icons.
