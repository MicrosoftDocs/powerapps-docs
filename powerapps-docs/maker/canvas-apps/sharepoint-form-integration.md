# Understand SharePoint forms integration

You can [customize a form for a SharePoint list](/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-apps/get-started/create-your-first-custom-form) when you integrate a SharePoint list into Power Apps. In this article, you see how these forms work and how you can customize them.

When you customize a form for a list, you see the default generated form works for all operations, like creating, showing, or editing an item. This functionality uses generated formulas and the **SharePointIntegration** control.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create or view a list in SharePoint, you're automatically redirected to Microsoft Lists. The list can always be found in both Microsoft Lists and SharePoint. Learn more in [What is a list in Microsoft 365?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-a-list-in-microsoft-365-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5)

## Understand the default generated form

The default generated form consists of the following controls and their corresponding defaults. Formulas are autogenerated within the defaults.

- **FormScreen1**: This [screen](controls/control-screen.md) contains the form.

- **SharePointForm1**: This [form](working-with-forms.md) can create, show, or edit a list item.

  - **Data Source**: The list for which the form is customized. For example, a SharePoint list acts as a data source.

  - **Item**: A selected item from a list. This item is set to `First()` item in the list for your convenience, when working in Power Apps Studio.

    ```power-fx
    If( IsBlank(SharePointIntegration.Selected) || IsEmpty(SharePointIntegration.Selected),
        First('*YourListName*'),
    SharePointIntegration.Selected )
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > This formula pattern uses `... SharePointDatasourceName.Selected` and works for the **Item** property of a form. See the [Common issues with the SharePointIntegration object](#common-issues-with-the-sharepointintegration-object) for a formula pattern to set the value of a SharePoint record.

- **OnSuccess**: Once the item is created or saved successfully, the form is reset and SharePoint hides the form.

  ```power-fx
  ResetForm(SharePointForm1); RequestHide()
  ```

- **SharePointIntegration**: Communicates user actions between SharePoint and Power Apps.

  | Property | Description | Example |
  |----------|-------------|---------|
  | Data Source | The list for which the form is customized. | *YourListName* |
  | OnNew | Sets **SharePointForm1** in new mode. | *NewForm(SharePointForm1)* |
  | OnView | Sets **SharePointForm1** in view mode. | *ViewForm(SharePointForm1)* |
  | OnEdit | Sets **SharePointForm1** in edit mode. | *EditForm(SharePointForm1)* |
  | OnSave | Submits the changes to **SharePointForm1**. The **SharePointForm1.OnSuccess** formula executes when you successfully submit a form. | *SubmitForm(SharePointForm1)* |
  | OnCancel | Resets the changes to **SharePointForm1**. SharePoint always hides the form when a user selects **Cancel** in SharePoint. | *ResetForm(SharePointForm1)* |

These defaults ensure that the form works when running within SharePoint. The defaults change the Power Apps form mode as the user interacts with it in SharePoint, and they ensure that the changes are submitted to SharePoint.

## Understand the SharePointIntegration control

The **SharePointIntegration** control communicates user actions between SharePoint and Power Apps.

> [!NOTE]
> You can access properties for the **SharePointIntegration** control only when the form is running in SharePoint, not when you're customizing the form in Power Apps Studio. These properties might not be available in **OnStart** or **OnVisible**.

The **SharePointIntegration** control has these properties:

| Property | Effect or description |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Selected | The selected item from the list. |
| OnNew | Activates when a user selects the **New** button or opens the **Create item** form in SharePoint. |
| OnView | Activates when a user selects an item or opens the **Item detail** form in SharePoint. |
| OnEdit | Activates when a user selects the **Edit all** button or opens the **Edit item** form in SharePoint. |
| OnSave | Activates when a user selects the **Save** button in SharePoint. |
| OnCancel | Activates when a user selects the **Cancel** button in SharePoint. |
| SelectedListItemID | Item ID for the selected item in a list. |
| Data Source | The list that contains the record that the form  shows, edits, or creates. If you change this property, the **Selected** and **SelectedItemID** properties might stop working. |

## Customize the default form

You can change the formulas to further customize the forms.

Consider these tactics when you customize forms:

- Use the **OnSave** formula of the `SharePointIntegration` control to customize the effect of a user selecting **Save** in SharePoint. If you have multiple forms, make sure to submit the changes only for the form currently being used.

  > [!TIP]
  > Set different values for a variable in the **OnNew**, **OnView**, and **OnEdit** formulas. You can use this variable in the **OnSave** formula to determine which form is being used.

- Include **RequestHide()** in the **OnSuccess** formula of all your forms. Without this function, SharePoint doesn't know when to hide the form. Avoid running important code *after* calling **RequestHide()**. Code should run while the form is still visible and able to run logic.

- You can't control the hiding of a form when a user selects **Cancel** in SharePoint. Always reset your forms in the **OnCancel** formula of the `SharePointIntegration` control.

- Properties for the `SharePointIntegration` control might not be available in **OnStart** or **OnVisible**. These events execute only once while the list is loaded. You can use **OnNew**, **OnView**, or **OnEdit** to run logic before the form is shown to the user.

## Common issues with the SharePointIntegration object

- When the value of `SharepointIntegration.Selected` is set to a collection on the **OnView** property, it doesn't show the latest value. The recommended way to fix this problem is to use `SharepointIntegration.SelectedListItemID`, and then do a lookup on the table to get the selectedRecord.

  For example, for **OnView** property:

  - Instead of:

    ```power-fx
    Set( selectedItem,
    SharePointIntegration.Selected );
    ```

  - Use:

    ```power-fx
    Set( selectedLookupItem,
    LookUp( YourSharepointIntegrationObject, 
    ID=SharePointIntegration.SelectedListItemID ) );
    ```

- Collection variables aren't reset on closing the Power Apps form and the state is persisted for the entire session. If there are any use-cases where the variables need to be reset, clear the variables in the **OnView** property of the `SharePointIntegration` object.

- Don't use imperative functions such as **Launch()** in the `SharePointIntegration` properties (such as **OnNew** and **OnView**). This use can cause unexpected behavior since the `SharePointIntegration` lifecycle events (such as selections changing) can trigger in the background even when the form isn't visible.
