## Limitations of controls in Teams

This section lists limitations of canvas apps controls for apps within Microsoft Teams.

### General limitations

Apps made with Power Apps in a Dataverse for Teams environment can't be opened outside of Teams. To use controls like *Camera*, upgrade your Power Apps license so that the app can be opened outside of Teams&mdash;for example&mdash;in the Power Apps mobile app.

### Limitations of specific controls

- [Barcode control](controls/control-new-barcode-scanner.md) - the barcode scanner control isn't supported in Teams Mobile.

- [Camera control](controls/control-camera.md) - the Camera control isn't supported in Teams Mobile. If you're creating a Power Apps app for use inside Teams, use the [Add picture](controls/control-add-picture.md) control instead.

- [Microphone control](controls/control-microphone.md) - the following conditions apply when using the Microphone control in apps created using Power Apps on Teams Mobile:

    - The audio format for microphone recordings in Teams will always be *AAC* with a file extension of .MP4.
    - Teams has its own recording experience. The microphone control inside apps created using Power Apps will be disabled during the recording period.
    - Microphone recordings are limited to a maximum duration of 10 minutes.

### Unsupported controls

The following controls aren't supported by apps embedded in Teams:

- [Address Input](geospatial-component-input-address.md)
- [Camera](controls/control-camera.md) (in Teams Mobile)
- [Map](geospatial-component-map.md)
- [Mixed reality](mixed-reality-overview.md) (View in MR, View shape in MR, Measure in MR)
- [Power BI tile control](controls/control-power-bi-tile.md)
- [Web barcode scanner control](controls/control-barcodescanner.md)
