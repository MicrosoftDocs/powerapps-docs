# Continue editing your app with Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Build and continue editing your app with the help of Copilot powered by AI. Tell Copilot what changes you want to make to your app in simple language, and let AI do the work for you.

The Copilot panel is available when you edit a canvas app in Power Apps Studio. You can edit your app by telling Copilot what kind of changes you want to make such as add a screen, configure navigation, styling a single control, or bulk editing.
