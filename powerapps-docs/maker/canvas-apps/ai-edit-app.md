# Edit your app with Copilot in Power Apps Studio (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Edit your apps without writing code or designing screens. With Copilot in Power Apps, you can use natural language to describe the changes you want to make, and AI does the rest.

Copilot is a feature in Power Apps that helps you edit your apps with AI assistance. You can access Copilot from Power Apps Studio when you edit a canvas app. Tell Copilot what kind of changes you want to make in the Copilot conversation pane, such as adding a screen, configuring navigation, styling a control, or editing multiple controls at a time.
