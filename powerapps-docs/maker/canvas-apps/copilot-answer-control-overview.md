#  Use Copilot answer control for canvas apps (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Makers can use the Copilot answer control to set predefined questions that end users can use to get AI-generated information with a single click. The control is powered by Microsoft Copilot and is designed for mobile users to provide them with immediate answers to frequently asked questions.

## Enable Copilot answer control for your environment

To use the Copilot answer control in a canvas app, an admin must first turn on the feature, **Allow canvas editors to insert the Copilot answer component, which allows users to receive an AI-powered answer to a predefined data query** in their environment. 

This setting can be found in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**. For more information, see [Manage feature settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features#copilot-preview).
