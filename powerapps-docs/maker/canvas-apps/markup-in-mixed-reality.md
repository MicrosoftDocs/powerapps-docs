# Use the Markup in MR control in Power Apps (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This is a preview feature.
>[!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

Add the **Markup in MR** control in your app to allow users to add markups to visually specify an area or a particular asset in their environment.
Users can instantly place mixed reality markups such as arrows, add drawings, and then take photos of the marked-up object.

The **Markup in MR** control creates a **Markup in MR** button in your mixed reality app. When a user selects the **Markup in MR** button, it shows a live camera feed of the device. A user can identify points of interest to begin inking or adding arrows directly on the object.

Ink and arrows will scale appropriately depending on the distance from the objects. When you exit the **Markup in MR** screen screenshots are captured in the control's **Photos** output property.

> [!TIP]
> The mixed-reality (MR) controls work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. Tracking is better on LIDAR-enabled devices.

> [!TIP]
> The MR controls in Power Apps use Babylon and Babylon React Native. Mixed reality content that works in the [Babylon sandbox](https://sandbox.babylonjs.com/) should work in Power Apps through this shared MR platform. If your content works in Babylon but not in Power Apps, ask a question in the [Power Apps Community Forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Get-Help-with-Power-Apps/ct-p/PA_General). (Tag it with "mixed reality.")

## Use Markup in MR

When a user selects the **Markup in MR** button, they will be prompted to move their phone side-to-side for better object or area detection. Once an object or area is detected the user can start using the markup toolbar.

### Add an arrow

To position an arrow:

- Make sure the arrow is selected in the markup toolbar.

- Move your device around to position the dot on the object or area you want.
    to highlight

- Select to place the ghost arrow on your device screen.

- To rotate the arrow, select and drag the arrow in a circular motion (360
    degrees).

### Inking

To determine where you start drawing:

- Make sure the ink pen is selected in the markup toolbar.

- Select and drag on the screen to start drawing.

## Add the Markup in MR control 

Insert the control into your app as you normally would for any other button control.

With an app open for editing in [Power Apps
Studio](https://create.powerapps.com/):

1. Open the **Insert** tab.

2. Expand **Mixed reality**.

3. Select the control **Markup in MR** to place it in the center of the app screen or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

> Some properties are only available under **More options** in the **Advanced** tab on the **Markup in MR** pane.
