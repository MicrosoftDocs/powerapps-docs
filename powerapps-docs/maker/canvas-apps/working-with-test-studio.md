# Working with Test Studio (experimental)

In this quickstart, you'll create tests for a canvas app called Kudos. You can also explore and discover testing concepts and apply them to writing tests for your own canvas apps. The sample Kudos app is part of a suite of employee engagement apps available to download from [Employee Experience Starter Kit](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powerapps-employee-experience-starter-kit).

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is still experimental and we recommend you use it to write tests for non-production apps. For more information, see [Experimental and preview features](working-with-experimental-preview.md).

## Open Test Studio

You do not need to enable this in your app like other experimental features. Test Studio is available by default for all canvas apps.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

2. Create a [new app](get-started-test-drive.md) or [edit an existing app](edit-app.md).

3. Save your app to Power Apps to open Test Studio. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You must save an app before you can write tests for the app.

4. Select **Advanced tools** in the left navigation.

5. Select **Open tests** to open the Test Studio for this application. This  opens Test Studio in a new browser tab.

    ![Open Test Studio](./media/working-with-test-studio/open-tests.png "Open Test Studio")

> [!NOTE]
> Tests are published and stored in the app package. Exporting and importing a canvas app package to another environment will also include all the test definitions such as test suites and test cases you have created. 

## Create a test suite

By default, a test suite and test case are created for you in Test Studio. Test suites are used to organize your test cases. An app can contain one or more test suites. You can use the default test suite and case to begin writing your tests immediately or create a new test suite.

1. Select **New suite**.
2. Update the **Test suite name and description** by selecting the fields on the main grid.

    ![New test suite](./media/working-with-test-studio/new-test-suite.png "New test suite")

## Create a test case

Depending on how you want to organize or group your tests, you can create multiple test cases in a test suite. Each case can test a specific feature or a subset of functionalities in your app.

1. Select a test suite.
2. Select **New Case** in the top menu to create a new case.
3. Update the **Test case name and description** by selecting the fields on the main grid.

 ![New test case](./media/working-with-test-studio/new-test-case.png "New test case")

## Record a test case

A test case consists of test steps that contain actions. Test actions are written using Power Apps expressions that perform a task. You can use the recorder to automatically generate the test steps as you interact with your app. After you record, you can update the test case, add new steps, delete steps, and write test assertions to validate the result of your test.

> [!NOTE]
> Only a published app plays in record mode. Publish any recent changes to the app before you start recording a test case. Recording without publishing recent changes causes the last published version of the app to play in record mode.

1. Select **Record** from the top menu. This opens the published app with recording mode in a new browser tab.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Recording on an existing test case overrides any existing test steps already present.

    ![Record tests](./media/working-with-test-studio/record-tests.png "Record tests")

2. Interact with your app. Your actions are  **recorded** in the left pane.

3. Once interaction completes, select **Done**. Optionally, you can select **Cancel** to return to Test Studio without your interactions getting recorded. 

    ![Save recording](./media/working-with-test-studio/save-recording.png "Save recording")

4. View the test steps and the expressions that were automatically generated for you in Test Studio.

5. Edit the step description text in the main grid if required. You can also update the test step actions by selecting the formula on the main grid.

    ![Update test case](./media/working-with-test-studio/update-test-case.png "Update test case")

### Add test steps and test assertions

Every test case should have an expected result. In the Kudos example, one of the expected results of sending a kudo is creating a new record in the Common Data Service (Common Data Service) database. You will now update the test case and add additional test steps to validate that a record was created successfully.

Follow these steps to verify a successful record creation:

- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the beginning of the test case.
- Initialize a variable for the kudo record count in the database at the end of the test case.
- Write a test assertion expression to validate it incremented by one count. If the count does not increase by one, the test assertion fails, and your test case fails.

To add test steps and test assertions in the Kudos app:

1. Select Step 1 or the step above which you want to insert a new step. 

2. Select **Insert a step above** from the top menu or by selecting the option from the active row. This creates an empty step.

    ![Insert step](./media/working-with-test-studio/insert-step-above.png "Insert step")

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you select **Insert step above**, a new blank step is added above the current step. You can also use **Assert**, **SetProperty**, **Select** or **Trace** actions instead. This adds a step with a respective action formula that you can edit.

3. Update the step description. For example, "Count Kudo in database".

4. Enter an expression or formula into the action input to count the records in the database before executing the test.

    You can use any supported expression. You can also query any data sources, collections, variables, or run flows that are contained in your app, as well as create new global variables or collections to use in your tests.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Set(kudosBeforeTest, CountRows(Filter(Kudos, Receiver.Email = "someone@example.com")))```

5. Select Step 2 or the step above which you want to insert a new step.

6. Select **Insert a step above** from the top menu or by selecting the option from the active row. This creates an empty step.

7. Enter an expression or formula in the action input to [Trace](./functions/function-trace.md) and write the *kudosBeforeTest* value to the test results record.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Trace("kudosBeforeTest : " & kudosBeforeTest);
    ```

    ![Kudos before test](./media/working-with-test-studio/kudos-before-test.png "Kudos before test")

8. Go to the bottom of the test case and insert a new step to count the records in the database after the test has completed.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Set(kudosAfterTest, CountRows(Filter(Kudos, Receiver.Email = "someone@example.com")))```

9. Add a final step to validate that the record count in the database has increased by a count of 1 and enter the following assertion action to verify this:

    ```powerapps-dot
    Assert(kudosAfterTest = kudosBeforeTest + 1, "Kudos count incorrect. Expected : " & kudosBeforeTest + 1  & " Actual :" & kudosAfterTest)
    ```

    ![Kudos after test assert](./media/working-with-test-studio/kudos-after-test-assert.png "Kudos after test assert")

10. Save the test case from the top-right menu in Test Studio. 

## Play back your test

You can play back your recorded test to validate app functionality. You can play back all tests within a single test suite, or a single test case. 

Before you play the recording back with recent changes, you must publish the app:

![Play without publishing](./media/working-with-test-studio/publish-test-studio-changes.png "Play without publishing")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you skip publishing, the recording  playback will not contain your recent test changes. The last published test case or suite will play  against the app.

1. Select **Publish**. This automatically saves and publishes your test.

    ![Publish changes](./media/working-with-test-studio/publish-button.png "Publish changes")

2. Select either a test suite or a single test case.

3. Select **Play**. The published app opens in **Play** mode, and you can see your test steps playing back automatically. A green check mark indicates when a test step is executed successfully. If a step fails, a red failure indicator along with a failure message is displayed.

    ![Play mode](./media/working-with-test-studio/play-mode.png "Play mode")

4. Select **Done** to return to Test Studio.

### Failed assertion

In this section, you'll change the test assertion to experience a failed test:

1. Edit the assertion step by selecting the expression box.

2. Update ```+ 1``` to ```+ 2``` in test action. This means that the test  expects two records to be created, which is incorrect. If the test is successful, only one record should be created in the database.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Assert(kudosAfterTest = kudosBeforeTest + 2, "Kudos count incorrect. Expected : " & kudosBeforeTest + 2  & " Actual :" & kudosAfterTest)
    ```

    ![Assert count update](./media/working-with-test-studio/assert-count-update.png "Assert count update")

3. Select **Publish**.

4. Select **Play**.

5. View the test playing back. The final step now fails and shows an error and the message you provided in the assertion step.  

    ![Playback error](./media/working-with-test-studio/playback-error.png "Playback error")

### Playing tests in a browser

You have the option to copy a link to play a test in separate browser outside Test Studio. This helps integrate your tests in a continuous build and release pipeline such as **Azure DevOps**.

The play link for the selected test is persisted. It doesn't change for the test suite or test case. You can update your tests  without the need to modify build and release processes.

To play tests in your browser:

1. Select a test suite or test case in the right pane.

2. Select **Copy play link**.

    ![Copy play link](./media/working-with-test-studio/copy-play-link.png "Copy play link")

3. You are prompted to publish your tests if there are any unpublished changes.

    ![Publish before copy link](./media/working-with-test-studio/publish-before-copy-link.png "Publish before copy link")

4. You can select to skip the publish process and copy the play link. New test changes do not play if you skip.

    ![Play link copied](./media/working-with-test-studio/copy-play-link-ack.png "Play link copied")

5. Open a browser and paste the URL into the address bar to play the test.

6. View your test playing back.

## Processing test results

The test panel visible when playing back tests in Test Studio is not visible when using a browser. Due to this, you cannot determine the specific test step that executes, or if a test passes or fails.

To determine test results outside of Test Studio, there are two properties called **OnTestCaseComplete** and **OnTestSuiteComplete** available in the test object that you can use to process the results of your tests. When integrating tests into a continuous build and release pipeline like **Azure DevOps**, these properties can be used to determine if you should proceed with the app deployment.

The expression entered for these properties triggers when each case or suite completes. You can customize these properties to process and send the results of your tests to various data sources or services such as:

- SQL Server.
- Common Data Service.
- Power Automate.
- Email using Office 365.

These settings apply to every test suite or test case in your app. After each test suite or test case completes, the test results and any trace messages contained in the tests are available in the **TestCaseResult** and **TestSuiteResult** records.

The **TestCaseResult** record contains the following properties:

- *TestCaseName* – the name of the test case.
- *TestCaseId* – the ID of the test case.
- *TestSuiteName* – the test suite name that the case belongs to.
- *TestSuiteId* – the test suite ID that the case belongs to.
- *StartTime* – the start execution time of the test.
- *EndTime* – the end execution time of the test.
- *Traces* – the result of any test assertions and any messages from the Trace function.
- *Success* – indicates if the test case completed successfully.
- *TestFailureMessage* – if the case failed, the failure message.

The **TestSuiteResult** record contains the following properties: 

- *TestSuiteName* – the test suite name.
- *TestSuiteId* – the test suite ID.
- *StartTime* – the start execution time of the test suite.
- *EndTime* – the end execution time of the test suite.
- *TestsPassed* – the number of test cases that completed successfully in the suite.
- *TestsFailed* - the number of test cases that failed in the suite.

In this quickstart, you'll create two custom entities in the Common Data Service database to store the test results by customizing the **OnTestCaseComplete** and **OnTestSuiteComplete** properties:

1. Select **Test** in the left pane or **View** on the suite header.

    ![Test or view set property](./media/working-with-test-studio/test-or-view-to-set-property.png "Test or view set property")

2. Select the **OnTestCaseComplete** action.

3. Input an expression to process the results of your test. The following sample saves each test case's results to the custom AppTestResults entity in Common Data Service. The test results can optionally be stored to SQL, SharePoint, or any other data source. You might need to set or increase the Trace field in your data source as required.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The following samples require a [Common Data Service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/commondataservice/). You can create a [simple app](data-platform-create-app.md) or [build an app from scratch](data-platform-create-app-scratch.md) using Common Data Service. Also, refer to the [Patch](./functions/function-patch.md) function reference for more details to modify records of a data source used in the following samples.

    ```powerapps-dot
    //Save to Common Data Service
    Patch(AppTestResults
    , Defaults(AppTestResults)
    , {
             TestPass: TestCaseResult.TestCaseName & ":" & Text(Now())
             ,TestSuiteId: TestCaseResult.TestSuiteId
             ,TestSuiteName: TestCaseResult.TestSuiteName
             ,TestCaseId: TestCaseResult.TestCaseId
             ,TestCaseName: TestCaseResult.TestCaseName
             ,StartTime: TestCaseResult.StartTime
             ,EndTime: TestCaseResult.EndTime
             ,TestSuccess: TestCaseResult.Success
             ,TestTraces: JSON(TestCaseResult.Traces)
             ,TestFailureMessage: TestCaseResult.TestFailureMessage
    }
    );
    ```
    ![OnTestCaseComplete example](./media/working-with-test-studio/ontestcasecomplete-example.png "OnTestCaseComplete example")

4. Select the **OnTestSuiteComplete** action.

5. Input an expression to process the results of your test. In the following sample, you'll save each test suite's results to the custom AppTestSuiteResults entity in Common Data Service. 

    ```powerapps-dot
    //Save to Common Data Service
    Patch(AppTestSuiteResults
        , Defaults(AppTestSuiteResults)
        , {
             TestSuiteId: TestSuiteResult.TestSuiteId
             ,TestSuiteName: TestSuiteResult.TestSuiteName
             ,StartTime: TestSuiteResult.StartTime
             ,EndTime: TestSuiteResult.EndTime
             ,TestPassCount: TestSuiteResult.TestsPassed
             ,TestFailCount: TestSuiteResult.TestsFailed
        }
    );
    ```

    ![OnTestSuiteComplete example](./media/working-with-test-studio/ontestsuitecomplete-example.png "OnTestSuiteComplete example")

Other examples of expressions you could use in these properties are:

- Send results to a flow in Power Automate.

    ```powerapps-dot
    MyTestResultsFlow.Run(JSON(TestCaseResult))
    ```

- Email your results.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Office365.SendMailV2("someone@example.com", "Test case results", JSON(TestCaseResult, JSONFormat.IndentFour))
    ```

- Receive an app notification of the test result.

  For example, receive a notification after the test completes when playing the test in a browser, outside of Test Studio.

    ```powerapps-dot
    Notify(TestCaseResult.TestCaseName & " : "
            & If( TestCaseResult.Success
                , " Passed"
                , TestCaseResult.TestFailureMessage)
            ,If(  TestCaseResult.Success
                , NotificationType.Success
                , NotificationType.Error)
    )
    ```

## Test Functions

In addition to the [functions](formula-reference.md) available in Power Apps, the following are common functions that you will typically use when authoring tests:

- [Select](./functions/function-select.md)
- [SetProperty](./functions/function-setproperty.md)
- [Assert](./functions/function-assert.md)
- [Trace](./functions/function-trace.md)
