# Add images to Excel from Power Apps
Create an app automatically in which users can show, add, or delete images from files or drawings from a **Pen** control. The app is based on an Excel file that you create and upload to a cloud-storage account.

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with [adding and configuring controls](add-configure-controls.md).
* Familiarity with [configuring Excel data as a table](https://support.office.com/article/Format-an-Excel-table-6789619F-C889-495C-99C2-2F971C0E2370?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).
* A [Power Apps connection](add-data-connection.md) to a cloud-storage account (such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive) in which you can store an Excel file.

## Create the data source and the app
1. In Excel, add **Caption** and **Image [image]** to any two cells that are side by side (for example, A1 and B1) and that are just above two empty cells.
2. Format the cells that you updated and the cells just below them as a table, and name the table (for example, **Images**).

3. Save the file (for example, as **ImageDemo**), and upload it to your cloud-storage account.
4. In Power Apps, click or tap **New** on the **File** menu (along the left edge if you haven't yet opened an app), and then click or tap **Phone layout** in the tile for your cloud-storage account.
   
    ![Select your cloud-storage account](./media/add-images-to-excel/select-account.png)
5. Under **Choose an Excel file**, click or tap the file that you created.
   
    ![Select your workbook](./media/add-images-to-excel/select-workbook.png)
6. Under **Choose a table**, click or tap the table that you created, and then click or tap **Connect**.
