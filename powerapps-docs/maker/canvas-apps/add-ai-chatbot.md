# Add Chatbot control to a canvas app (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Add Chatbot control to your canvas apps and embed a published [Power Virtual Agents](/power-virtual-agents/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents) chatbot to assist your end-users with a variety of requests&mdash;from providing simple answers to common questions to resolving issues requiring complex conversations. 

You can use an AI bot or AI boosted conversations bot:

- With AI chatbots, you can create an extended tree of answers to support your users. More information: [Power Virtual Agents preview quickstart (preview)](/power-virtual-agents/preview/quickstart)

- With AI boosted conversations Power Virtual Agents bot your bot can have a higher ability to respond to the user by using a number of prompts or generating a response based on provided "fallback" website which you set. The "fallback" website can include internal documents or publicly available websites. More information: [AI-based boosted conversations overview (preview)](/power-virtual-agents/nlu-gpt-overview)


You can design the Chabot control by giving it a name, change the size of the control window, and position it anywhere on the screen.
