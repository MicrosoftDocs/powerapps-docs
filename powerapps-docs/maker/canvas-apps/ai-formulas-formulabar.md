# Use Copilot to create and edit Power Fx formulas

Copilot is an AI feature in Power Apps Studio that helps you create and modify Power Fx formulas quickly. You can use Copilot in the formula bar to explain Power Fx formulas in natural language or generate Power Fx formulas from natural language or code comments.

## Prerequisites

Copilot must be enabled for your environment and tenant. For more information, see [Enable or disable Copilot (preview) in Power Apps](ai-overview.md#disable-copilot-in-power-apps).

## Explain a formula

Use Copilot in the formula bar to understand what a formula is doing in plain language.

1. Select a control and its corresponding property. For example, a label control with its **Text** property.

1. On the formula bar, select the dropdown near the **fx** field label to see and choose **Explain this formula**.

   Alternatively, you can select a subset of a formula and then select the dropdown near the **fx** field label and choose **Explain this selection** to explain only that part.

   :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/copilot-explain-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copilot's option to Explain this section, showing part of the formula highlighted by the user." lightbox="media/copilot/copilot-explain-section.png":::

    Copilot provides an explanation of the formula that you can copy and insert as a code comment or share with other makers who are working on the same app. When Copilot explains a selection, it might add context if that's important for the explanation.

### Known limitations of explaining formulas

- The maximum length for a formula explanation is 5,000 characters. If the formula exceeds this limit, use a partial explanation to ensure it works.
- Copilot only recognizes default properties in Power Apps.
- Copilot doesn't recognize user-defined functions.

## Generate formulas from code comments

Copilot can generate Power Fx formulas from code comments in the formula bar. You can accept the suggestion or type the formula yourself. Formula code comments can also serve as documentation for your formulas, just like regular code comments.

1. With your canvas app open for editing, type a code comment using `//` or `/*` in the formula bar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-comment-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a comment typed in the Copilot formula bar." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-comment-copilot.png":::

    Wait a few seconds for Copilot to generate a formula suggestion or press `Enter` to generate it immediately.

1. Press `Tab` on the keyboard to accept and use the suggested formula. You can also type through the suggestion.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-commentfx-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a comment with a suggested formula." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-commentfx-copilot.png":::

The suggestion remains until you select elsewhere or type a character that doesn't match the suggestion.

You can keep the comments used for generating Power Fx formulas in the formula bar as documentation, similar to traditional code comments.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If Copilot doesn't provide a suggestion, then it couldn't generate a formula based on your comment. Try rephrasing the comment.
> - We recommend enclosing in quotes the elements that you want to include in your formula, such as `"Button1.text"`.

### Known limitations of generating formulas from code comments

- Copilot works on a singular control and property, and it doesn't make changes to other controls or properties to achieve the desired outcome.
- Copilot doesn't take existing formula text into account.
- Copilot only recognizes default properties in Power Apps.
- Copilot doesn't recognize user-defined functions.
- Code comments only work with general Power Fx functions, and not Power Apps-specific functions such as `Navigate()`.
- The advanced panel doesn't trigger suggestions.
- Existing formulas for the property aren't included in the suggestion.

## Create a formula (preview)

[This section is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

From the Copilot dropdown menu in the formula bar, you can now generate a formula using natural language to make a discrete request.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Copilot for formulas** feature is turned on by default. To turn it off, you can find the setting with your app open. Go to Settings/Updates/Preview and find the **Copilot for formulas** toggle. Turning the setting off makes the **Create a formula (preview)** menu option disappear from the Copilot dropdown menu of the formula bar.

### Use Copilot to create a formula from a discrete request

1. Select a control, like a **Text label**, and its corresponding property, such as **Text**.

1. On the formula bar, select the **Copilot functionality menu** > **Create a formula**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-create-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a Formula functionality showing a sample input." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-create-input.png":::
1. In the Copilot text box, type your request, such as *show today's day of the week*.
1. Select the **Create** arrow to submit your request.
1. Copilot attempts to create a formula. Select **Apply** to insert the formula in the same position as the Copilot interface, or update and resumbit your request.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-create-formula.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a Formula functionality showing recommended formula." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-create-formula.png":::

    You see the result after you apply the formula.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/copilot-request-result.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the day of the week in a text label.":::

  > [!NOTE]
  > The same limitations apply for creating a formulas from a discrete request as [generating formulas from code comments](ai-formulas-formulabar.md#known-limitations-of-generating-formulas-from-code-comments).
