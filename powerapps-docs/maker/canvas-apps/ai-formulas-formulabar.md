# Use Copilot to create and edit Power Fx formulas

Copilot is an AI feature in Power Apps Studio that helps you create and modify Power Fx formulas quickly. You can use Copilot in the formula bar to explain Power Fx formulas in natural language or generate Power Fx formulas from natural language or code comments.

## Prerequisites

Copilot must be enabled for your environment and tenant. For more information, see [Enable or disable Copilot (preview) in Power Apps](ai-overview.md#disable-copilot-in-power-apps).

 
> [!NOTE]
> By default, the new formula bar is enabled. If the **Copilot functionality menu** isn't visible, check the following app settings in Power Apps Studio:
> 1. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Updates**.
> 1. From the **Retired** tab, turn off the **Legacy formula bar** toggle.


## Explain a formula

Use Copilot in the formula bar to understand what a formula is doing in plain language.

1. Select a control and its corresponding property.

1. On the formula bar, select the **Copilot functionality menu** > **Explain this formula**.

    Copilot provides an explanation of the formula that you can copy and insert as a code comment or share with other makers who are working on the same app.

### Known limitations of explaining formulas

- The maximum length of a formula explanation is 5,000 characters.
- Copilot only recognizes default properties in Power Apps.
- Copilot doesn't recognize user-defined functions.

> [!NOTE]
> AI generated content may be inaccurate and should be checked for accuracy.

## Generate formulas from code comments 

Copilot can generate Power Fx formulas from code comments in the formula bar. You can accept the suggestion or type the formula yourself. Formula code comments can also serve as documentation for your formulas, just like regular code comments.

1. With your canvas app open for editing, type a code comment using `//` or `/*` in the formula bar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-comment-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a comment typed in the Copilot formula bar." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-comment-copilot.png":::

    Wait a few seconds for Copilot to generate a formula suggestion or press Enter to generate it immediately.

1. Press Tab on the keyboard to accept and use the suggested formula. You can also type through the suggestion.

    :::image type="content" source="media/copilot/ufb-commentfx-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a comment with a suggested formula." lightbox="media/copilot/ufb-commentfx-copilot.png":::

The suggestion remains until you select elsewhere or type a character that doesn't match the suggestion.

You can keep the comments used for generating Power Fx formulas in the formula bar as documentation, similar to traditional code comments.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If Copilot doesn't provide a suggestion, then it couldn't generate a formula based on your comment. Try rephrasing the comment.
> - We recommend enclosing in quotes the elements that you want to include in your formula, such as `"Button1.text"`.

### Known limitations of generating formulas from code comments

- Copilot only recognizes default properties in Power Apps.
- Copilot doesn't recognize user-defined functions.
- Code comments only work with general Power Fx functions, and not Power Apps-specific functions such as `Navigate()`.
- The advanced panel doesn't trigger suggestions.
- Existing formulas for the property aren't included in the suggestion.
