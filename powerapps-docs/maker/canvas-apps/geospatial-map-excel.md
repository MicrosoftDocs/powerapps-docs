# Use a data source to insert pins

You can load a table that contains existing data into the map control. The control will then plot each row in your table as a map pin.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Canvas app and make sure it meets the [Geospatial prerequisites](geospatial-overview.md#prerequisites-for-full-support). 
2. In your app, [insert a map](geospatial-component-map.md). 

## Add pin data from an Excel workbook

Your data source needs to contain a named table with the following columns that should then be mapped to the associated property in the control's **Advanced** pane.

Column description | Maps to property | Required
-- | -- | --
Label for the pin | ItemsLabels | Required
Longitude of the pin | ItemsLongitudes | Required
Latitude of the pin | ItemsLatitudes | Required
Color of the pin | ItemsColors | Optional
Icon for the pin | ItemsIcons | Optional

The color field accepts any CSS string, as defined in [Color enumeration and ColorFade, ColorValue, and RGBA functions in Power Apps](/functions/function-colors).

You can use the icons described in the [List of image templates](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-use-image-templates-web-sdk#list-of-image-templates) topic as your icon.

The following Excel table shows the required columns:

You can copy the following sample data to test this functionality:

Name | Longitude | Latitude | Color | Icon
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
Fourth Coffee (sample) | -98.29277 | 26.2774 | Blue | marker-flat
Litware, Inc. (sample) | -96.85572 | 32.55253 | #ffefcd| hexagon-thick
Adventure Works (sample) | -96.99952 | 32.72058 | | car
Fabrikam, Inc. (sample) | -118.30746 | 34.86543 | |
Blue Yonder Airlines (sample) | -118.66184 | 34.17553 | |
City Power & Light (sample) | -113.46184 | 37.15363 | |
Contoso Pharmaceuticals (sample) | -80.26711 | 40.19918 | |
Alpine Ski House (sample) | -102.63908 | 35.20919 | |
A Datum Corporation (sample) | -89.39433 | 40.71025 | |
Coho Winery (sample) | -116.97751 | 32.87466 | |

1. Copy and paste the table into a new data source. In this example, we are using an Excel workbook.  

1. Select one of the cells, and then on the Home tab in the ribbon, select **Format as Table** and choose any style, and then **OK**.

1. Select the table, and then go to the **Table Design** tab on the ribbon. Enter a name for the table under **Table Name:**, for example *TestData*.

1. Save the workbook.

1. Open or create a new app in Power Apps, and insert the map control.

1. On the **Properties** pane, select the **Locations(Items)** field and then search for *excel* and select **Import from Excel**.

1. Locate the Excel workbook and then select **Open**. Select the table that contains the information, **TestData**, and then **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot of the table selection panel.](./media/geospatial/select-table.png)

1. On the **Properties** pane, go to the **Advanced** tab, and select **More options**.

1. Set the following properties:

    - **ItemsLabels** as *"Name"*
    - **ItemsLatitudes** as *"Latitude"*
    - **ItemsLongitudes** as *"Longitude"*
    - (Optional) **ItemsColors** as *"Colors"*
    - (Optional) **ItemsIcons** as *"Icons"*

1. The map control will now show each row in the table as a pin, labeled with its *Name* as defined in the Excel table, and using the provided icons and colors. If an icon or color isn't provided, then the control will use the default icon and color.

 >[!NOTE]
 > Each map control has a pin limitation of 5000 pins where it prioritizes latitude and longitude columns over the address column. Within the 5000 pin limitation, up to 50 addresses can be geocoded for each map control. Therefore, for pins with both latitude / longitude and an address bound, the map control will prioritize using the latitude / longitude to avoid geocoding the address.

## Save geocoded addresses from map control to data source

To avoid geocoding the same set of addresses every time the map control is launched, you can save the geocoded addresses back to the original data source, such that when the map relaunches, it will use the latitude and longitude instead of geocoding the addresses again.

To do so, add a button to save the geocoded address back to the original data source with the following formula:

```powerapps-dot
 ForAll(Map1.GeocodedItems, Patch(Accounts1, LookUp(Accounts1, ThisRecord.Address = Address && ThisRecord.Name = Label), {Latitude: Latitude, Longitude: Longitude }))
```

## Other geospatial controls

To see dynamic address suggestions as you type, use the **[Address input](geospatial-component-input-address.md)** control.
