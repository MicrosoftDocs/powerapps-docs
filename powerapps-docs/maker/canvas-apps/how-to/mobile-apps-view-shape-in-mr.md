# Create an app to view a shape in mixed reality

You can use the **View Shape in MR** control in your app to let users see if a simple cube might fit within a specified space. They might want to do this to see how a certain object that you provide would fit in their space. If you have a 3D model or a head-on picture for the object, you'd like to fit test consider using the [View in MR](../mixed-reality-component-view-mr.md) instead.

The control creates a button in your app. When app users select the button, it overlays a cube onto the live camera feed of the device. You set up the dimensions of the cube when you edit the control in Power Apps.

In this article, we'll create a screen in an app that will allow users to create a custom cube shape by inputting unit to be used (centimeters, feet, inches, or meters), and defining the height, width, and depth of the cube.

## Prerequisites

See [prerequisites for mixed-reality capable devices](../mixed-reality-overview.md#prerequisites).

## Add controls for cubeâ€™s dimensions and units

Add header and labels to define cube's dimensions and units to the app screen.

### Header label

With an app open for editing in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com/), add a text label to the screen. Position it at the top-left corner of the screen and modify the following properties in the Properties tab:

| Property       | Value               |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Text           | `"Place A Cube"`      |
| Font size      | `24`                  |
| Font weight    | `FontWeight.Semibold` |
| Text alignment | `Align.Center`        |
| Width          | `Parent.Width`        |

Then in the Advanced tab, modify the following properties:

| Property | Value                  |
|----------|------------------------|
| Color    | `RGBA(255, 255, 255, 1)` |
| Fill     | `RGBA(56, 96, 178, 1)`   |

This change will provide a header for the screen.

### Labels and controls to specify cube properties

1. Add four text labels to the screen. These labels will be used to identify the
controls we'll add later. For each label, modify the **Text** property to one of the following:

    - `Unit Type`
    - `Width`
    - `Height`
    - `Depth`

1. Set the **Width** property of these labels to 160 and position them so they're stacked vertically in the order described above, near the top of the screen and to the left side.

1. Add a dropdown control and three text entry controls. The dropdown will be used to select a unit type for the cube dimensions and the three text entry controls will be used to enter the width, height, and depth of the cube.

1. Select the drop-down, rename it to *drpUnitType*, and change the following properties:

    | Property | Value                                       |
    |----------|---------------------------------------------|
    | Items    | `["Centimeters", "Feet", "Inches", "Meters"]` |
    | Default  | `"Feet"`                                      |
    | Width    | `280`                                         |

1. Position the control to the right of the Unit Type label.

1. Add three text input controls, and rename them to *txtShapeHeight*, *txtShapeWidth*, and *txtShapeDepth*. Change the following properties for all three controls:

    | Property | Value             |
    |----------|-------------------|
    | Default  | `2`                 |
    | Format   | `TextFormat.Number` |
    | Width    | `144`               |

1. Position the text input control named *txtShapeWidth* to the right of the Width label. Likewise, position the controls named *txtShapeHeight* and *txtShapeDepth* to the right of the Height and Depth labels, respectively.

Next, you'll add the View Shape in MR control and configure it to use the controls that were created to provide dynamic dimensions to the MR cube it'll generate.

## Insert the View Shape in MR control

Insert the control into your app.

1. Open the **Insert** tab.

1. Expand **Mixed Reality**.

1. Select the control **View Shape in MR** to place it in the center of the
    app screen, or drag and drop it to position it anywhere on the screen.

1. Once the control has been added, position it near the bottom of the screen and change the following properties:

    | Property    | Value                      |
    |-------------|----------------------------|
    | Text        | `"Place a cube"`             |
    | ShapeWidth  | `txtShapeWidth.Text`         |
    | ShapeHeight | `txtShapeHeight.Text`        |
    | ShapeDepth  | `txtShapeDepth.Text`         |
    | Units       | `drpUnitType.Selected.Value` |
    | Width       | `280`                        |

## Test the app

Now that all the controls have been added, [save and publish](../save-publish-app.md) the app. On a [mixed-reality capable device](#prerequisites), open the app, and press the **Place a cube** button. This will open the **View Shape in MR** experience, allowing the user to define an area to be measured.

Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the device by slowly moving it left and right while pointing the camera at a surface to be measured. Once the calibration is complete, you'll see an array of dots on the surface and a circle near the center of the screen. This circle shows where the cube can be placed initially. Once the cube has been placed, it can be moved or rotated by using touch controls.

To move the cube, press on it and slide it to where you would like it to be placed. To rotate the cube, press one finger to the screen, and then swipe with another finger right or left.

Use the back button in the top-left corner to return to the app screen and change one or more of the width, height, depth, or unit type settings. Select the **Place a cube** button and place the new cube.
