# Create a canvas app with the barcode scanner control

The barcode scanner control in Power Apps lets you use your phone or mobile device to scan barcode from [various formats](../controls/control-new-barcode-scanner.md#barcode-availability-by-device).

Some of the common uses of barcode scanner control in a canvas app are:

- An app to check in items like books into a collection
- An inventory management app that uses barcode to identify items
- An employee app to check in and badge scanning for security

In this article, we'll create a canvas app with barcode scanner and display scanned items in a gallery.

## Prerequisites

- [Power Apps license](/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus)
- Before you create an app from scratch, familiarize yourself with Power Apps basics by [generating an app](../get-started-test-drive.md) and then customizing that app's [controls](../add-configure-controls.md), [gallery](../add-gallery.md), [forms](../working-with-forms.md), and [cards](../working-with-cards.md).
- To create an app, you must be assigned to the [Environment Maker](/power-platform/admin/database-security) security role.

## Open a blank app

Create a [blank canvas app](../create-blank-app.md).

## Add barcode scanner

1. From the left-pane, select **Screen1**.

1. From the left-pane, select **+ Insert** > expand **Media** > select **Barcode scanner** control.

    ![OnScan property](media/ceate-app-barcode-scanner/select-advanced-onscan.png "OnScan property")

1. Set the **OnScan** property of the Barcode scanner control to this expression by typing or pasting it in the formula bar.

    ```powerapps-dot

        {ScannedItem: BarcodeScanner1.Value, ScannedTime: Now()}
    )
    ```

    ```powerapps-dot
    ThisItem.ScannedItem
    ```

    ![Text property of the Label control](media/ceate-app-barcode-scanner/add-gallery-7.png "Text property of the Label control")

    ThisItem.ScannedTime
    ```

## Try the app

1. To test the app, select **Screen1**, and then press **F5** on the keyboard.

1. After testing, [save and publish](../save-publish-app.md) the app.
