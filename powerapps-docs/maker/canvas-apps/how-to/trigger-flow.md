# Create a canvas app that can trigger a Power Automate flow

Power Automate can be used to create logic that performs one or more tasks when an event occurs in a canvas app. For example, a button can be configured so that, when a user selects it, an item is created in a list, an email, or meeting request is sent, a file is added to the cloud, or all of these. Any control in the app can be configured to start the flow, that continues to run even if you close the app.

In this article, we'll learn how create and trigger a flow using canvas apps.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, you'll need Power Automate and Power Apps environment with a Dataverse database. If you don't have a license, you can sign up for the [Power Apps Developer Plan](../../developer-plan.md) or use [Power Apps trial](../../signup-for-powerapps.md).

## Create a trial environment

An environment in Power Apps is a space to store, manage, and share your organizationâ€™s business data, apps, chatbots, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences. Each environment can have one Dataverse database.

To make sure that you have what you need to complete this lesson, we're going to create a new environment that includes a Dataverse database. This is a 30-day trial that will go away at the end of the 30 days, but you can upgrade it to a sandbox or production environment if you want to keep it.

We're going to create a trial environment that will include a Dataverse database, and the sample data used in this article.

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. Select **Environments**.

1. Select **New**.

1. Name the environment **Dataverse Trial**.

1. Select **Trial** for environment type.

1. Toggle **Create Database** to **Yes**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Toggle **Deploy Sample Apps and Data** to **Yes**.

1. Select **Save**.

Your trial environment will now be created, including a Dataverse database and sample data.

## Create a canvas app

In this lesson, we'll create an app to search, view, and create customer accounts using the **Accounts** table in Dataverse.

1. Start by creating a [blank canvas app](../create-blank-app.md).

1. The **To** field and the **Body** field are automatically auto-populated with the following:
  
   - To: **Sendanemail(V2)_To**.
   - Body: **Sendanemail(V2)_Body**


1. In **Subject** field, delete **Sendanemail(V2)_To** and enten **Thank you for your business!** in the **Subject** field.

1. Select **Save** to save the flow.

## Trigger the flow from within the canvas app

1. Select the **Yes** button > in the **OnSelect** property enter the two parameters for the To email address and the Body of the email as follows:

    ```powerapps-dot
    FlowtriggeredbyaPowerapp.Run(
       EditForm3.LastSubmit.Email,
       TextInput1.Text
    );
    Navigate(Screen1);
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The email address is picked up from the new account record created on the previous screen. and the body for the email is picked from the text box text captured on this screen.

    
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Fill in the two parameters for the To email address](media/trigger-flow/onselect-flow.png "Fill in the two parameters for the To email address")

## Test the app

Run the app in preview mode. In this test, we'll create a new account by entering details like account name, phone number, city, and email address on the **New Account** screen. On saving the new account details, we'll be prompted to send an email to the customer where we can update the verbiage of the email, and then select **Yes** to send the email. This will trigger the flow, and email will be sent to the email address on the account.
