# How to create a canvas app with Power BI visual

Microsoft Power BI is a powerful analysis and visualization tool. Power Apps is great at enabling people to take action on the web and mobile. Canvas apps created using Power Apps can be embedded in a Power BI report. Similarly, a Power BI report tile can be added to a canvas app. The best of both worlds can be achieved at the same place and same time.

In this example, we'll create a quick Power BI report and a canvas app, and then see how we can add the report as a tile in the app.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, we'd need the ability to create Power BI dashboards and reports.

## Sign in to Power BI

Sign in to Power BI with the same Office license as the one used for creating the Power Apps.

## Create a new workspace

1. Select **Workspaces** from the left-pane.
