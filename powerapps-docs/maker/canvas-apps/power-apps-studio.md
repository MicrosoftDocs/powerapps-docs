Advanced tools include **Monitor** and **Tests** where you can track and test your app.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-advanced-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the Advanced tools section is located.":::

### 7 â€“ Canvas/screen

The canvas shows the currently selected screen in the **Tree view** from the authoring menu.

You can [Use inline actions in Power Apps Studio](inline-actions.md) when you're editing a canvas app so you don't have to leave your current view. Inline actions help the development process to be more efficient.

The properties pane shows properties and options available for the currently selected object on the canvas.

- The **Display** tab shows generic options such as the name, description, exit or exit message, and more.
- The **Advanced** tab shows options for customization with key value pairs in areas of action, data, and design in your app.

  > [!TIP]
  > The advanced properties might be locked for editing, such as when working with data cards. You can select [Unlock to change properties](working-with-cards.md#unlock-a-card) in such situations.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-prop-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the properties pane that appears when you select an object in your canvas. You see two tabs in this pane: **Display** and **Advanced**.":::

### 10 â€“ Screen selector

Use the screen selector to switch between screens when your canvas app has multiple screens. You can also select a screen from the authoring menu by selecting the tree view. If the current selection is inside a container, or inside an individual cell in a gallery, the selector shows the breadcrumbs for the parent elements at each level.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-screen-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the location of the screen selector.":::

### 11 â€“ Change canvas screen size

You can zoom in or out while authoring the canvas app. Select **Ctrl**+**0** (zero) to *fit to window*, which fits the canvas to the current authoring window size.

The following image shows what the canvas looks like when *fit to window*. You can also use the controls to zoom further in or out to view your canvas.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-fit-canvas-to-window.png" alt-text="Screnshot that shows what a canvas fit to window looks like. This image also shows the zoom controls for your canvas." lightbox="media/studio/pa-studio-fit-canvas-to-window.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> The zoom percentage or screen size used in authoring a canvas app has no effect on the aspect ratio configured for the app. When you preview your app or play a published app, your screen size is temporary.
