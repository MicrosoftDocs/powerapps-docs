The properties pane shows properties and options available for the currently selected object on the canvas.

- The **Properties** tab shows generic options such as the name, color, size, or position.
- The **Advanced** tab shows options for advanced customization. The advanced properties might sometimes be locked for editing, such as when working with data cards. You can select [Unlock to change properties](working-with-cards.md#unlock-a-card) in such situations.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-prop-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the properties pane that appears when you select an object in your canvas. Advanced properties is a tab in that same pane.":::

Real-time, in-product help is available from the documentation using the Power Platform virtual agent. The virtual agent can help answer questions about common scenarios.

For more information, see [Get help building your app from a virtual agent](../common/virtual-agent.md).

## 10 â€“ Screen selector

Use the screen selector to switch between screens when your canvas app has multiple screens. You can also select a screen from the authoring menu by selecting the tree view. If the current selection is inside a container, or inside an individual cell in a gallery, the selector shows the breadcrumbs for the parent elements at each level.

:::image type="content" source="media/studio/pa-studio-screen-selector.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the location of the screen selector.":::

## 11 â€“ Change canvas screen size

You can zoom in or out while authoring the canvas app. Select **Ctrl**+**0** **Fit to window** to fit the screen size based on the current authoring window size.

> [!NOTE]
> The zoom percentage or screen size used in authoring a canvas app has no effect on the aspect ratio configured for the app. When you preview your app or play a published app, your screen size is temporary.
