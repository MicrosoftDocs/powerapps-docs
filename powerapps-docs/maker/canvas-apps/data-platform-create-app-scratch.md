# Create a canvas app from scratch using Microsoft Dataverse

Build a canvas app to manage data that's stored in Dataverse, using standard tables (which are built in), custom tables (which your organization creates), or both.

When you build an app from Dataverse, you don't need to create a connection from Power Apps, as you do with data sources such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365, or Salesforce. You need only to specify the tables that you want to show or manage in the app.

## Prerequisites

- Before you create an app from scratch, familiarize yourself with Power Apps basics by [generating an app](data-platform-create-app.md) and then customizing that app's [gallery](customize-layout-sharepoint.md), [forms](customize-forms-sharepoint.md), and [cards](customize-card.md).
- [Switch to an environment](intro-maker-portal.md#choose-an-environment) in which a database has been created with sample data. If you have an appropriate license, you can [create an environment](/power-platform/admin/create-environment) to meet this need.
- To create an app, you must be assigned to the [Environment Maker](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles) security role.

## Open a blank app

To create an app from scratch that uses data from Dataverse, the first step is to [create a blank app](create-blank-app.md). For this exercise, when you create the blank app, ensure you choose **Phone** format.

## Specify a table

1. In the middle of the screen, select **connect to data**.

1. In the app authoring menu, select **Data**. If this is your first time, you're prompted to create a connection to Dataverse. Select **Create** this connection.

1. Select **Add data** and in the search box enter, **Accounts** > **Connect**.

1. Close the **Data** pane by selecting the close icon in the upper-right corner.

## Add a list screen

1. On the command bar, select **New screen** > **Templates** tab > **List**.

1. In the left navigation bar, select **BrowseGallery1**, and then set the value of the **Items** property to this formula:

    `SortByColumns(Search(Accounts, TextSearchBox1.Text, "name"), "name", If(SortDescending1, SortOrder.Descending, SortOrder.Ascending))`

    This formula specifies that:

   - The gallery should show data from the **Accounts** table.
   - The data should be sorted in ascending order until a user selects the sort button to toggle the sort order.
   - If a user types or pastes one or more characters into the search bar (**TextSearchBox1**), the list will show only those accounts for which the **name** field contains the characters that the user specified.

     You can use [these and many other functions](formula-reference.md) to specify how your app appears and behaves.

1. Set the gallery's layout to show only the name of each account, and configure the title bar to show the word **Browse**, as [Customize a gallery](customize-layout-sharepoint.md) describes.

    ![Browse screen.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/final-browse.png)

1. In the left app authoring pane, hover over **Screen1**, select the ellipsis icon (...), and then select **Delete**.

1. In the left app authoring pane, hover over **Screen2**, select the ellipsis icon (...), and then select **Rename**.

1. Type or paste **BrowseScreen**, and then rename the gallery in that screen as **BrowseGallery**.

    ![Rename Browse screen, gallery.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/rename-browse.png)

## Add a form screen

1. Repeat the first step of the previous procedure, except add a **Form** screen instead of a **List** screen.

1. Set the form's **DataSource** property to **Accounts** and its **Item** property to **BrowseGallery.Selected**, as the **Advanced** tab of the right-hand pane shows.

1. On the **Properties** tab of the right-hand pane, select **Edit Fields** to open the **Fields** pane.

1. Select **Add field**, and then select the check boxes for these fields:

    - **Account Name**
    - **Address 1: Street 1**
    - **Address 1: City**
    - **Address 1: ZIP/Postal code**
    - **Number of Employees**
    - **Annual Revenue**

    > [!NOTE]
    > Outside of this scenario, you can create a custom field by selecting **New field**, providing the required information, and then selecting **Done**. More information: [Create a column](../data-platform/create-edit-field-portal.md#create-a-column).<br><br>![Select and add a column.](media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/choose-or-add-fields.png "Select and add a column")

1. Select **Add**.

1. Set the title bar's **Text** property to show **Create/Edit**.

    The screen reflects your changes.

    ![Screen after the changes.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/field-list.png)

1. Rename this screen **FormScreen**.

## Configure icons

1. On the **BrowseScreen**, set the **OnSelect** property of the circular icon near the top of the screen to this formula:

    `Refresh(Accounts)`

    ![Refresh icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/refresh-icon.png)

1. Set the **OnSelect** property of the plus icon to this formula:

    `NewForm(EditForm1); Navigate(FormScreen, ScreenTransition.None)`

    ![Add icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/plus-icon.png)

1. Set the **OnSelect** property of the first arrow pointing to the right to this formula:

    `EditForm(EditForm1); Navigate(FormScreen, ScreenTransition.None)`

    ![Next icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/next-icon.png)

1. On the **FormScreen**, set the **OnSelect** property of the cancel icon to this formula:

    `ResetForm(EditForm1);Navigate(BrowseScreen, ScreenTransition.None)`

    ![Cancel icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/cancel-icon.png)

1. Set the **OnSelect** property of the checkmark icon to this formula:

    `SubmitForm(EditForm1); Navigate(BrowseScreen, ScreenTransition.None)`

    ![Checkmark icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/checkmark-icon.png)

1. On the **Insert** tab, select **Icons**, and then select the **Trash** icon.

1. Set the **Trash** icon's **Color** property to **White** and its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

    `Remove(Accounts, BrowseGallery.Selected); Navigate(BrowseScreen, ScreenTransition.None)`

    ![Trash icon.](./media/data-platform-create-app-scratch/trash-icon.png)

## Test the app

1. On the actions menu, select ![Preview button.](media/studio/preview-button.png) **Preview the app**. More information: [ Preview an app](preview-app.md)

1. Toggle the list between ascending and descending sort orders, and filter the list by one or more characters in the account name.

1. Add an account, edit the account that you added, start to update the account but cancel your changes, and then delete the account.

## Next steps

- [Link this app to a solution](add-app-solution.md) so that you can, for example, deploy it to a different environment or publish it on AppSource.
- [Open one or more sample apps](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md), and explore different types of apps that you can create.
