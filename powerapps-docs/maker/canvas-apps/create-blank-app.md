# Create a blank canvas app from scratch

In Power Apps, create a blank canvas app that you can customize further and add a data source. 


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the [Environment Maker](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles)  security role, either directly or through a Dataverse team that is part of the **AAD Security Group** category.

## Create a blank canvas app

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Create** > **Start with a blank canvas**.

1. Choose an app size (format) such as responsive, tablet, or phone.

Once created, the app opens in [Power Apps Studio](power-apps-studio.md) where you can start building and customizing it.

## Next steps:

Configure the app's functionality and, depending on your business scenario, add the necessary connections and data sources.

- [Add a connection](add-data-connection.md)
- [Add and configure controls](add-configure-controls.md)
- [Save and publish an app](save-publish-app.md)
