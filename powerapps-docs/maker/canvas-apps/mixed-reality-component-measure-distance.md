# Take measurements in mixed reality

Use the **Measure in MR** control in a canvas app to measure distance, area, and volume in the real world. You can also create two- and three-dimensional freeform shapes and see how they fit in a real-world space.

The **Measure in MR** control adds a button to your app. When a user selects the button, the app shows a live feed from the device camera. On-screen instructions direct the user to establish tracking by slowly panning the device from right to left across the surface to be measured. The user identifies a starting point and adds segments as needed until the measurement is complete. Dimensions of the measured space are overlaid on the camera feed.

The user can submit the measurements for capture in the control's **Measurements** output properties. The user can also take screenshots while a space is measured. The screenshots are captured in the control's **Photos** output property.

> [!TIP]
> The mixed-reality (MR) controls work best in well-lit environments with flat-textured surfaces. Tracking is better on LIDAR-enabled devices.

## Add a **Measure in MR** button to an app screen

With your app open for [editing](edit-app.md) in [Power Apps Studio](https://create.powerapps.com):

1. Open the **Insert** tab and expand **Mixed Reality**.
2. Select **Measure in MR** to place the control in the app screen, or drag the control to the screen to position it more precisely.

The control is a button that's labeled with an icon of a cube and the text *Measure in MR*. Change the label and hide the icon if you like in the **Text** and **Display type** properties.

### Properties

Change the **Measure in MR** button's behavior and appearance using properties. Some properties are only available on the **Advanced** tab.

### Output properties

Your app can make use of more properties when a user interacts with the **View in MR** control. These are known as output properties. You can use these properties in other controls or to customize the app experience.

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| Photos | Captures, in a collection, information about photos the user takes while a space is measured. Use the collection to [upload mixed-reality photos to OneDrive and show them in a gallery](mixed-reality-take-upload-photos.md). |
| Measurements | Captures, in a table, the measured distances, volumes, and areas. |
| Segments | Captures, in a table, information about segments in a measured object. |


 The Measurements table has the following columns:

- **Label:** A string that identifies the measurement
- **Id:** A number that uniquely identifies the measurement
- **Units:** A string that identifies the unit of the measurement
- **Height:** A number that represents the height of the measured volume (0 if a 2D area was measured)
- **Length:** A number that represents the total length of the measured perimeter or path
- **BoundingWidth:** A number that represents the minimum width that bounds the shape
- **BoundingDepth:** A number that represents the minimum depth that bounds the shape  
- **Area:** A number that represents the estimated area of the measured shape in units squared
- **Volume:** A number that represents the estimated volume of the measured shape in units cubed
  
The Segments table has the following columns:

- **Length:** A number that represents the total distance of a segment in the specified units
- **DirectionX:** A number that represents the X direction of the segment in world (3D) space
- **DirectionY:** A number that represents the Y direction of the segment in world(3D) space (typically 0)
- **DirectionZ:** A number that represents the Z direction of the segment in world (3D) space
