# Create accessible canvas apps

An accessible canvas app will allow users with vision, hearing, and other impairments to successfully use the app. In addition to being a requirement for many governments and organizations, following the below guidelines increases usability for all users, regardless of their abilities.

Use the **[Accessibility Checker](accessibility-checker.md)** to help review potential accessibility issues in your app. 

## Layout and color
Common sense and uncomplicated design helps apps be more accessible to all users. When doing heavy customization of apps take note of the below suggestions. Power Apps themes are designed to meet accessibility standards.
- Ensure all elements are clearly visible and text is of sufficient size.  All content must be easily read and understood by the naked eye.
- Ensure input elements are labeled on the screen. **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** property defines what the screen reader will announce.
- If customizing colors, ensure the contrast ratio of text to background is 4.5:1 or greater. Software tools that assist this process are readily available.
- Ensure layout follows a logical flow when read from top to bottom, left to right.
- [Create a responsive app](build-responsive-apps.md) so that low-vision users can zoom in and use it without scrolling back and forth.

## Keyboard

When testing your app's accessibility, ensure the app can be used by keyboard only, with or without a screen reader.

The **Tab** key should navigate to interactive elements in a logical order. You can create this with a [logical app structure](accessible-apps-structure.md#logical-control-order) and by setting each control's **[TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** property accordingly.
- Label, Image, Icon, Shape controls: Set **TabIndex** to 0 if they are meant to be interactive. Otherwise, set **TabIndex** to -1.
- Do not set **TabIndex** greater than zero.
- Ensure that the **Simplified tab index** app setting is enabled.

## Screen readers

The following screen readers have been verified to work with Power Apps:

- **JAWS**: Microsoft Edge
- **Narrator**: Microsoft Edge
- **NVDA**: Google Chrome, Firefox
- **TalkBack**: Google Chrome, [Power Apps mobile](../../mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile.md)
- **VoiceOver**: [Power Apps mobile](../../mobile/run-powerapps-on-mobile.md), Safari (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)

To ensure a satisfying experience with the screen reader it is recommended to:

- Ensure all input controls have the **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** property set.
- For images, set **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** to an appropriate description.
  - If a picture is not used as a button or a link (i.e. icon is there just for the decoration) and should not be read by the screen reader, make sure the **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** is empty or not set.
  - If a picture or an icon is used as a button, then set **[TabIndex](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** to 0 and **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** to the link description.

## Control type and structure
Using the right controls and grouping them will help screen reader users understand the structure of the app.

- Include at least one heading on each screen of the app. You can create headings by setting the **Role** property of a **[Label](controls/control-text-box.md)**.
- Use a **[Button](controls/control-button.md)** instead of a **[Label](controls/control-text-box.md)** for interactive text.
- Group related content in **[Containers](controls/control-container.md)**.
- Be aware of [unsupported design patterns](accessible-apps-limitations.md).

## Multimedia
Ensure all videos are captioned and a transcript of all audio recordings is available to the user. **Video** control supports closed captions in WebVTT format via the **ClosedCaptionsUrl** property.

With the screen reader enabled, **Timer** does not announce button text, but how much time has passed. Announcements can't be turned off, even if timer is hidden with low opacity.

## Working with signatures
If you have a signature field that uses the PenInput control, you need to enable an alternative method of signature input. The recommended way is to show a TextInput control where a user can type their name.  Ensure the signing instructions are placed in the **[AccessibleLabel](controls/properties-accessibility.md)** property and the control is placed close to the Pen input - to the right or immediately below.
