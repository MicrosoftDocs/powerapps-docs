# Common problems and resolutions while creating a portal

In this article, you'll learn about the common problems that occur while creating a Power Apps portal, and how to resolve them.

## No permissions to create a portal

If you don't have sufficient privileges to create a portal in an environment, you'll see an error as follows:

![Create portal error.](media/portal-create-error.png "You don't have appropriate permissions to create a portal in this environment. Try selecting another environment or create new environment. If that doesn't help, contact your global administrator.")

For permissions and role memberships required to create portals, see [Admin roles required for portal administrative tasks](admin/portal-admin-roles.md)

## Your data isn't quite ready

Sometimes the database creation can take time and the correct status might not reflect on the home page. In this case, you'll see the following message:

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Data not ready.](media/data-not-ready.png "Your data isn't quite ready. The database that includes data for this app is still being built. We'll let you know once it's ready.")

If you keep getting the "create database" prompt or "your data isn't quite ready" prompt, you can try refreshing the Power Apps home page before selecting the **Portal from blank** tile.

## No permissions to create Azure Active Directory application

When you create a portal, portal as a new application is registered in Azure Active Directory associated with the tenant. If you don't have sufficient permissions to register an application with your Azure Active Directory tenant, you'll see an error as follows:

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Azure Active Directory error.](media/azure-ad-error.png "You don't have required permissions to create Azure Active Directory applications in this tenant.")

To create and register applications in Azure Active Directory, you must contact your tenant administrator to turn on the **App registrations** setting for your tenant. For information, see [Required permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#required-permissions).
