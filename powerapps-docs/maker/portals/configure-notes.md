# Configure notes as attachments for basic and advanced forms

Similar to subgrids, adding notes to your managed forms on the portal is easy. Just add the notes control to the model-drive app forms through the [form designer](../model-driven-apps/create-design-forms.md) and you're done. You can configure the behavior of the notes control by using metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> - You must enable attachments for the table in Microsoft Dataverse first before using this feature. More information: [Create a table](../data-platform/data-platform-create-entity.md#create-a-table)
> - Explicit [table permissions](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md) are required for any notes to appear on the portal. For the detailed steps on how to create and assign these, go to [Assign table permissions](#assign-table-permissions).
> - The description of each note must be prefixed with **\*WEB\*** (*'WEB' keyword with an asterisk sign (\*) before and after*) for the note to appear on the portal page.

## Notes configuration for basic forms

1. Open the [Portal Management](./configure/configure-portal.md) app.

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** on the left pane.

1. Fill in the fields by entering appropriate values. These settings are explained in more detail below under [Attributes](#attributes), [Create dialog options](#create-dialog-options), [Edit dialog options](#edit-dialog-options), and [Delete dialog options](#delete-dialog-options).

### Assign table permissions

Notes, and the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons for the note control will be hidden on the basic or advanced form unless you create and assign the appropriate table permissions to the records as follows:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A user must sign-in and be the creator of the note to edit or delete it using the portal. Users can't edit or delete a note created by others, even if you assign them table permissions.

1. Ensure the **Enable Table Permissions** checkbox is selected on the form for which you want notes to appear.

    ![Enable table permissions on a basic form.](media/configure-notes/enable-entity-permissions-form.png "Enable table permissions on a basic form")

1. For the table that has the notes control enabled, create a table permission with the required privileges. The scope should be appropriately set depending on the level of access required to end users.

    For example, create a table permission for a Lead table that shows notes on the basic form, with privileges including Read, Write, Create, Append, and Append To.

    ![Create new table permissions.](media/configure-notes/new-entity-permission.png "Create new table permissions")

1. [Associate the table permission with a web role](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md#add-table-permissions-to-a-web-role) for the user.

    For example, add the table permission created in the previous step to the Lead Manager web role.

    ![Add web roles to a table permission.](media/configure-notes/add-webrole-entity-permissions.png "Add web roles to a table permission")

1. Create a table permission for the **Annotation** table with the [Parental access type](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md#parental-access-type) and required privileges as explained in the table below. The **Parent Table Permission** must be set to the same table permissions created in step 2.

    | Note action | Required permissions |
    | - | - |
    | **Read** | Read |
    | **Add** | Create, Append (Append To required on Parent Table Permission) |
    | **Edit** | Write |
    | **Delete** | Delete |

    For example, create a table permission for the Annotation table, with the Leads table permission created in the previous steps set as the parent table.

### Notes created with rich-text editor

You can view the notes created using the [Rich text editor control configurations](../model-driven-apps/rich-text-editor-control.md) on your portal webpage. However, when you try to edit, you'll see the text in HTML markup format.

For example, this note shows rich-text format in the model-driven app.

![Dynamics 365 form.](media/configure-notes/dynamics-365-form.png)

The portal webpage shows the note in rich-text format.

![Portals form.](media/configure-notes/portals-form.png)

However, when editing the note from the portal webpage, you see the note in HTML markup format.

![Portals form in HTML when editing.](media/configure-notes/portals-form-edit.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you try to save a note with HTML markup using the portal, you'll receive this error: *We're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again, and if this persists, contact the website administrator.* To save the notes with HTML markup using the portal, you'll have to disable the request validation. However, disabling request validation applies to the entire website. For the steps to disable the request validation, and to understand its impact, go to [request validation](configure/entity-forms.md#request-validation).

## Notes configuration for advanced forms

Advanced form notes are configured in the same way as [basic form notes](#notes-configuration-for-basic-forms). Create a metadata record for the Advanced Form Step that has notes first, and then add the notes configuration metadata.

## Enable file attachment on form

Enable **Attach File** option for the **Basic Form** to show the attachment option available with the notes.

To enable attachment on a basic form:

1. Open the [Portal Management](configure/configure-portal.md) app.

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** on the left pane.

    ![Basic forms.](media/configure-notes/entity-forms.png)

1. From the list of forms, select to open a record of the form to which you want to add note configuration.

1. Select **Additional Settings** for the form. Configure the additional settings as per the fields explained in the section below.

    ![Additional settings - attach file.](media/configure-notes/additional-settings.png)

### Additional settings for file attachment

| Name | Description
| - | - 
| Attach File | Check the box to enable file attachments on the form.
| Attach File Save Option | Select **Notes** or **Portal Comments** to save file attachments. For notes attachments, select **Notes**.
