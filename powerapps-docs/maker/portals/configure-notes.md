# Configure notes as attachments for basic and advanced forms

Similar to subgrids, adding notes to your managed forms on the portal is easy&mdash;just add the notes control to the model-drive app forms through the [form designer](../model-driven-apps/create-design-forms.md) and you're done. You can configure the behavior of the notes control by using metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> - Explicit [Table Permissions](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md) are required for any notes to appear on the portal. For the detailed steps, go to [assign table permissions](#assign-table-permissions).
> - The description of each note must be prefixed with **\*WEB\*** (*'WEB' keyword with an asterisk sign (\*) before and after*) for the note to appear on the portal page.

## Notes configuration for basic forms

1. Open the [Portal Management](./configure/configure-portal.md) app.

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** from left pane:

    ![Basic forms](media/configure-notes/entity-forms.png)

1. From the list of forms, select to open a record of the form to which you want to add note configuration.

1. From the available tabs in form settings, select **Basic Form Metadata**:

    ![Basic form metadata](media/configure-notes/entity-form-metadata.png)

1. Select **New Basic Form Metadata**:

    ![New basic form metadata](media/configure-notes/new-entity-form-metadata.png)

1. Select **Type** as **Note**:

    ![Type as Note](media/configure-notes/type-notes.png)

1. The notes configuration settings are displayed. Most of the settings are collapsed by default. You can expand a section to see additional settings:

    ![Notes options](media/configure-notes/notes-options.png)

1. Fill in the fields by entering appropriate values. [!include[](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Attributes](#attributes), [Create dialog options](#create-dialog-options), [Edit dialog options](#edit-dialog-options), and [Delete dialog options](#delete-dialog-options)

1. (Optional, for a custom form) If you created a custom form and added the notes section to it, be sure to select **Notes** as the default tab you want to be visible:

    ![Notes in a custom form](media/notes-activities-tab.png "Notes in a custom form")

1. Save the form.

After adding the configuration, the Note control will be rendered by using the appropriate options enabled on the portal.

### Assign table permissions

Notes, and the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons for the note control will be hidden on the basic or advanced form unless you create and assign the appropriate table permissions to the records as follows:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A user must sign-in and must be the creator of the note to edit or delete it using the portal. Users can't edit or delete a note created by others, even if you assign them table permissions.

1. Ensure the **Enable Table Permissions** checkbox is selected on the basic form, or the advanced form step for the table permissions to take effect.

    For example, basic form for leads that show notes need to have table permissions enabled.

    ![Enable table permissions on a basic form](media/configure-notes/enable-entity-permissions-form.png "Enable table permissions on a basic form")

1. Create a table permission with the required privileges for the table that has the Notes control enabled on it. The scope should be appropriately set depending on the level of access required to end users.

    For example, Lead table that shows the notes on the basic form.

    ![Create new table permissions](media/configure-notes/new-entity-permission.png "Create new table permissions")

1. [Associate the table permission](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md#add-table-permissions-to-a-web-role) created in step 1 with a web role for the user.

    For example, add the table permission created in the previous step to the web role used in this instance for managing leads.

    ![Add web roles to an table permission](media/configure-notes/add-webrole-entity-permissions.png "Add web roles to an table permission")

1. Create a table permission on the **Annotation** table with the [Parental access type](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md#parental-access-type with the required privileges as explained in the table below. The **Parent Table Permission** for the Parent Scope on this table permission mut be set to the table permission created in step 2.

    | Note action | Required permissions |
    | - | - |
    | **Read** | Read |
    | **Add** | Create, Append (Append To required on parent table permission) |
    | **Edit** | Write |
    | **Delete** | Delete |

    For example, create a table permission for the Annotation table having the table permission created in step 1 as the parent table.
    
    ![Add table permissions](media/configure-notes/entity-permission.png "Add table permissions")

### Notes created with rich-text editor

You can view the notes created using the [rich-text editor in timeline](../model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md#enable-or-disable-rich-text-editor-for-notes-in-timeline) on your portal web page. However, when you try to edit, you'll see the text in HTML markup format.

For example, the note shows rich-text format in the model-driven app.

![Dynamics 365 form](media/configure-notes/dynamics-365-form.png)

Portal web page shows the note in rich-text format.

![Portals form](media/configure-notes/portals-form.png)

However, when editing the note from portal web page, you'll see the note in HTML markup format.

![Portals form in HTML when editing](media/configure-notes/portals-form-edit.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you try to save a note with HTML markup using the portal, you'll see this error: *We're sorry, but something went wrong. Please try again, and if this persists, contact the website administrator.* To save the notes with HTML markup using the portal, you'll have to disable the request validation. However, disabling request validation applies to the entire web site. For the steps to disable the request validation, and to understand its impact, go to [request validation](configure/entity-forms.md#request-validation).

## Notes configuration for advanced forms

Advanced form notes are configured in the same way as [basic form notes](#notes-configuration-for-basic-forms). Create a metadata record for the Advanced Form Step that has notes first, and then add the notes configuration metadata.

## Enable file attachment on form

Enable **Attach File** option for the **Basic Form** to show the attachment option available with the notes.

To enable attachment on an basic form:

1. Open the [Portal Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-portal) app.

1. Select **Basic Forms** under **Content** from left pane:

    ![Basic forms](media/configure-notes/entity-forms.png)

1. From the list of forms, select to open a record of the form to which you want to add note configuration.

1. Select **Additional Settings** for the form. Configure the additional settings as per fields explained in the [attachment options](#additional-settings-for-file-attachment):

    ![Additional settings - attach file](media/configure-notes/additional-settings.png)

### Additional settings for file attachment
