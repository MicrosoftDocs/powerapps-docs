# Configure notes for entity forms and web forms on portals

Just like with subgrids, adding notes to your managed forms on the portal is easy&mdash;just add the notes control to the model-drive app forms through the [form designer](../model-driven-apps/create-design-forms.md) and you're done. You can configure the behavior of the notes control by using metadata.

> [!Note]                                                           
> Explicit [Entity Permissions](configure/assign-entity-permissions.md) are required for any notes to appear on the portal. For read and edit, the Read and Write privileges must be granted. For create, two permissions must exist: a permission with the Create and Append privileges must be granted for the note (annotation) entity, the second permission must be assigned to the entity type the note is being attached to with the Append To privilege granted. The **Enable Entity Permissions** check box must be selected on the corresponding entity form or web form step for the entity permissions to take effect.

## Notes configuration for entity forms

1. Open the [Portal Management app](configure/configure-portal.md).
2. Go to **Portals** > **Content** > **Entity Forms**. A list of active entity forms is displayed.
3. Select the entity form to which you want to add note configuration.
4. Go to **Entity Form Metadata** either by using the top drop-down list or the subgrid on the main form of the entity form record that you are working with.
5. Select **Add New Entity Form Metadata** to add a new record.
6. From the **Type** drop-down list, select **Notes**. The notes configuration&ndash;specific settings are displayed. Most of the settings are collapsed by default. You can expand a section to see additional settings.
7. Fill in the fields by entering appropriate values. [!include[](../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Attributes](#attributes), [Create dialog options](#create-dialog-options), [Edit dialog options](#edit-dialog-options), and [Delete dialog options](#delete-dialog-options)
8. Save the form.

    After adding the configuration, the Note control will be rendered by using the appropriate options enabled on the portal.

### Assign entity permissions

You must create and assign the appropriate entity permission to the records as follows, otherwise the **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** buttons for the note will be hidden:

- Read, Write, Create, Append, and Append To privileges for the **Activity (activitypointer)** entity with the scope as **Global**. This entity permission must be associated with a web role for the user.
- Read, Write, Create, Append, and Append To privileges for the entity that has the Notes control enabled in it. The scope should be set to **Global**. This entity permission must be associated with a web role for the user.

    ![Add web roles to an entity permission](media/entity-permission-web-roles.png "Add web roles to an entity permission")

If you created a custom form and added the notes section to it, be sure to select **Notes** as the default tab you want to be visible.

## Notes configuration for web forms

Web form notes are configured in the same way as [entity form notes](#notes-configuration-for-entity-forms). You must first create a metadata record for the Web Form Step that has notes, and then add the notes configuration metadata.

> [!NOTE]
> Notes description must be prefixed with **\*WEB\*** (*'WEB' keyword with an asterisk sign (\*) before and after*) in order to display on the portal.
