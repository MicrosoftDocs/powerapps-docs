> [!NOTE]
> - Editing a portal through Power Apps portals Studio will temporarily cause poor portal performance due to multiple background processes. For example, the clear cache process runs and reloads data from Microsoft Dataverse.
> - Power Apps portals Studio only supports editing in the language selected while provisioning the portal. For help with creating portals in additional languages, see [Create additional portals in an environment](create-additional-portals.md).
