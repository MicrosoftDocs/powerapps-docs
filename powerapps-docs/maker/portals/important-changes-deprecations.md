# Important changes coming in Power Apps portals

The announcements for changes, and deprecations described in this article apply to Power Apps portals.

Makers, developers, and IT professionals can use this information to prepare for future releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Deprecated" means we intend to remove the feature or capability from a future major release. The feature or capability will continue to work and is fully supported until it is officially removed. This deprecation notification can span a few months or years. After removal, the feature or capability no longer work. This notice is to allow you sufficient time to plan and update your code before the feature or capability is removed.

## SameSite mode changes

Starting with portals version [9.3.6.x](versions/version-9.3.6.x.md), makers can mark **SameSite** mode as **Strict** for all portal cookies where applicable.  

With this change, we're adding a new website setting to control the **SameSite** mode for all cookies, configurable at specific cookie level.

| Site Setting Name | Scope | Possible value |
| - | - | - |
| HTTP/SameSite/Default | Global, for all cookies. | None <br> Lax <br> Strict |
| HTTP/SameSite/{CookieName} | Specific cookie. | None <br> Lax <br> Strict |

Default value for all existing and newly provisioned portals is **None**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting October 2021, all newly provisioned portals will have **Strict** as the Default value instead of **None**.
