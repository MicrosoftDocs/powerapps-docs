# Compose a page

[!include[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

After adding the required webpages and managing their hierarchy in the sitemap, you can add various components. The WYSIWYG editor allows you to add and edit the required components on the canvas easily. You can add and edit the following components on the canvas:

- Sections
    - One column section
    - Two columns section
    - Three columns section
- Portal components
    - Text
    - Image
    - IFrame
    - Form
    - List
    - Breadcrumb

> [!NOTE]
> If you customize your portal using the portal designer, the website users would notice a performance impact. We recommended you to do the changes during non-peak hours on a live portal. 

## Use the WYSIWYG editor

1.  [Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in the portal designer.  

2.  Select the page on which you want to add the component.

3.  Select an editable element on the canvas.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The editable elements are demarcated by a boundary.

4.  Select **Components** ![components icon](media/components-icon.png "Components icon") from the toolbelt on the left side of the screen.  

5.  Select the component to be added.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![components pane](media/components-pane.png "Components pane")  

    The selected component is added to the canvas inside the editable element.

6.  To delete a component, select the component on the canvas and then select **Delete** on the command bar at the top of the page.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![delete component](media/delete-component.png "Delete component")  

## Add sections

Sections allow you to define a structure for your page and arrange portal components accordingly. Once you add sections to your page, you can add portal components inside the sections as per the requirement.

1.	[Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in the portal designer.

2.	Select the page on which you want to add a section.

3.	Select an editable element on the canvas.

4.	Select **Components** ![components icon](media/components-icon.png "Components icon") from the toolbelt on the left side of the screen.

5.	Under **Section layout**, select the section type to be inserted.

6.	In the properties pane on the right side of the screen, enter or select the following information:

    - **Min Height**: Enter the minimum height of the section. If you add a component that occupies more space than the specified height, the section expands to accommodate the component. By default, the minimum height is 100px. You can also enter the height in points (pt) and percentage (%).

        > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
        > ![Alignment in the section](media/section-props-height.png "Alignment in the section")  

    - **Alignment**: Select whether the component in the section must be left, center, or right aligned.

        > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
        > ![Alignment in the section](media/section-props-align.png "Alignment in the section")  

    - **Background**: Select if would like to have color or an image as the section background.

        - **Fill**: Select a color for the background.

            > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
            > ![Fill color in the section](media/section-props-fill.png "Fill color in the section")  

        - **Image**: Select an image from the list. If you would like to upload a new image, select **Upload image**.

            > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
            > ![Add image in the section](media/section-props-image.png "Add image in the section")  

7.	Add the required portal component in the section.

### Add list

To create a custom menu, you must create the web link set in the Portal Management app. More information: [Manage web links](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/manage-web-links)

After you create the web link set:

1.	[Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in the portal designer.

2.	Select the header component. 

3.	In the properties on the right side of the screen, select the web link set name from the **Navigation Menu** list.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Navigation menu](media/navigation-menu.png "Navigation menu")

## Use code editor

To view the source of a component on the canvas, select the component, and then select the source code editor icon **&lt;/&gt;** in the footer.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![code editor icon](media/code-editor-icon.png "Code editor icon")  

The source code is displayed in the **Code Editor** pane at the bottom of the screen. The changes you made earlier are updated in the source code. To make changes, update the source code and select **Save**. The changes are reflected on the canvas.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![code editor](media/code-editor.png "Code editor") 

> [!NOTE]
