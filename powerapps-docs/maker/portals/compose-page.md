# Compose a page

After adding the required webpages and managing their hierarchy in the sitemap, you can add various components. The WYSIWYG editor allows you to add and edit the required components on the canvas easily. You can add and edit the following components on the canvas:

- Sections
    - One column section
    - Two columns section
    - Three columns section
- Portal components
    - Text
    - Image
    - IFrame
    - Form
    - List
    - Breadcrumb

> [!NOTE]
> If you customize your portal using Power Apps portals Studio, the website users would notice a performance impact. We recommended you to do the changes during non-peak hours on a live portal. 

## Use the WYSIWYG editor

1.  [Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in Power Apps portals Studio.  

2.  Select the page on which you want to add the component.

3.  Select an editable element on the canvas.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The editable elements are demarcated by a boundary.

4.  Select **Components** ![components icon](media/components-icon.png "Components icon") from the left side of the screen.  

5.  Select the component to be added.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![components pane](media/components-pane.png "Components pane")  

    The selected component is added to the canvas inside the editable element.

6.  To delete a component, select the component on the canvas and then select **Delete** on the command bar at the top of the page.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![delete component](media/delete-component.png "Delete component")  

## Add sections

Sections allow you to define a structure for your page and arrange portal components.

Once you add sections to your page, you can add portal components inside the sections as per the requirement.

1.    [Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in Power Apps portals Studio.

2.    Select the page on which you want to add a section.

3.    Select an editable element on the canvas.

4.    Select **Components** ![components icon](media/components-icon.png "Components icon") from left side of the screen.

5.    Under **Section layout**, select the section type to be inserted.

6.    In the properties pane on the right side of the screen, enter or select the following information:

       - **Min Height**: Enter the minimum height of the section. If you add a component that occupies more space than the specified height, the section expands to accommodate the component. By default, the minimum height is 100 px. You can also enter the height in points (pt) and percentage (%).

        > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
        > ![Min Height](media/section-props-height.png "Min Height")  

        - **Alignment**: Select whether the component in the section must be left, center, or right aligned.

        > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
        > ![Alignment in the section](media/section-props-align.png "Alignment in the section")  

        - **Background**: Select if you'd like to have color or an image as the section background.

        - **Fill**: Select a color for the background.

            > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
            > ![Fill color in the section](media/section-props-fill.png "Fill color in the section")  

        - **Image**: Select an image from the list. If you would like to upload a new image, select **Upload image**.

            > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
            > ![Add image in the section](media/section-props-image.png "Add image in the section")  

7.    Add the required portal component in the section.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The default option for **Edit** and **ReadOnly** modes is set as Query String Parameter Name passed as ID in URL. To change these values, you need to open Portal Management app and update the form properties.

    - **On success**: Select one of the following options:

        - **Show success message**: Requires a message to be displayed to the user on successful submission of the form. You can also select **Hide form on success** to hide the form upon successful submission.

        - **Redirect to webpage**: Redirects the user to the selected webpage in the portal. This field is required.

        - Only available for access type **Publish to web**.

### Power BI access type considerations

The following list explains Power BI access types in brief. And lists access type considerations for Power Apps portals. For more information about Power BI access types, go to [Difference between Power BI service and Power BI embedded](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-faq#how-is-power-bi-embedded-different-from-power-bi-the-service).

- **Embed for your customers**:
    - Shows the list of workspaces shared to user currently logged in and enabled for [Power BI Embedded service](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#enable-power-bi-embedded-service).
    - Uses Power BI Embedded service.
    - If you've used Power BI Embedded service with Power Apps portals before, you'll see the following error when you select **Embed for your customers**:

        ![Power BI Embed for your customers - enable visualization again](media/embed-power-bi-visualization-enable-again.png)
    
        When this happens, ensure you [disable](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#disable-power-bi-visualization) and then [enable](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#enable-power-bi-visualization) Power BI visualization again.
    - If you add Power BI with **Embed for your customers** on a Power Apps portal page that is available **anonymously**, anyone can view the dashboard. To secure such a web page, read [web page access control in Power Apps portal](../portals/configure/webpage-access-control.md).

- **Embed for your organization**:

    - Shows the list of workspaces shared with logged in user.
    - Uses Azure Active Directory authentication.

- **Publish to web**: Anyone on Internet can view your published report or visual. This requires no authentication and includes viewing detail level data your reports aggregate. Before publishing a report, make sure you can share the data and visualizations publicly. Don't publish confidential or sensitive information. Refer to your organization's policies before publishing.

### General Power BI considerations

- [Portals Studio](../portals/portal-designer-anatomy.md) performance can degrade while working with Power BI workspaces because of the following Power BI workspace configurations:
    - High number of workspaces shared with logged in maker user.
    - Power BI workspaces are shared with many users.
- [Capture liquid variable](../portals/liquid/portals-entity-tags.md#powerbi) isn't supported in portals Studio while working with Power BI component.
- If you [reset portal](../portals/admin/reset-portal.md) and provision a new portal, you must add portal application ID of the new portal to the **Portal Power BI Embedded service** Azure AD security group. For more information, go to [Set up Power BI integration](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#create-security-group-and-add-to-power-bi-account).
- If you make a change in Power Apps portals admin center, you must reload the portals Studio if you already have it open.
- Adding users to Power BI dashboards and reports may take a while to reflect in the portals Studio.

### Power BI performance and optimization considerations

Embedding multiple Power BI workspaces may need additional considerations. Refer to the following resources for Power BI embed scenario troubleshooting, optimization, and best practices:

- [Troubleshooting Power BI Embedded application content rendering](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-troubleshoot#content-rendering).
- [Power BI Embedded performance best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-performance-best-practices).
- [Power BI optimization guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/guidance/power-bi-optimization).
