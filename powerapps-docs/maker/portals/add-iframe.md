# Add IFrame


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

Add IFrame component to your portal page to embed a webpage from any other website. 

To add IFrame component:

1.  [Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in Power Apps portals Studio.  

2.  Select the page on which you want to add the component.

3.  Select an editable element on the canvas.

4.  Select **Components** ![components icon.](media/components-icon.png "Components icon") from the left side of the screen.  

5.  Under **Portal components**, select **IFrame**. The IFrame placeholder is added to the canvas.

6.  In the properties pane on the right side of the screen, enter the following information:

    - **Width**: Enter the width of the IFrame.

    - **Height**: Enter the height of the IFrame.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can also select the IFrame on the canvas and drag the handles to resize it.

    - **Link**: Enter the URL of the website to be displayed in the IFrame. Only secured links are acceptedâ€”that is, https:// is mandatory. By default, <https://www.bing.com> is available as the value.
