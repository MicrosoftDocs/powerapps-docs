# Work with Liquid templates

Liquid is an open-source template language integrated into portals. It can be used to add dynamic content to pages, and to create a wide variety of custom templates. 

> [!NOTE] 
> You can also work with Liquid templates in Power Pages. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction)

Using Liquid, you can:

- Add dynamic content directly to the **Copy** field of a webpage or the content of a [content snippet](../configure/customize-content-snippets.md).  

- [Store source content by using web templates](store-content-web-templates.md), entirely through configuration within Power Apps, for use throughout the Power Apps portals content management system.  

- [Render a website header and primary navigation bar](render-site-header-primary-navigation.md), entirely through configuration within Power Apps.
