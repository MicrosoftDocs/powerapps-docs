# Portal templates

You can create Common Data Service starter portal or Dynamics 365 Portal in PowerApps based on the selected environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing portals and existing portal templates (Community, Partner, Employee self-service, Customer self-service) are not completely supported in portal designer and some components might not render. However, you can continue editing rest of the components as usual.

## Environment with Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps

- **Customer self-service portal**: A customer self-service portal enables customers to access self-service knowledge, support resources, view the progress of their cases, and provide feedback.
- **Partner portal**: A partner portal allows every organization with resellers, distributors, suppliers, or partners to have real-time access to every stage of shared activities.
- **Employee self-service portal**: An employee self-service portal creates an efficient and well-informed workforce by streamlining common tasks and empowering every employee with a definitive source of knowledge
- **Community portal**: A community portal leverages peer-to-peer interactions between customers and experts to organically grow the catalog of available knowledge from knowledge base articles, forums, and blogs as well as providing feedback through comments and ratings
