# What is Power Pages?

Power Apps portals and Dynamics 365 portals are now referred to as [Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction). 

There is no migration or upgrade process. You can use the new [Power Pages design studio](/power-pages/getting-started/use-design-studio) to edit sites created in Power Apps. Existing tools such as the [Portals Management app](/power-pages/configure/portal-management-app) and [Power Platform CLI](/power-pages/configure/cli-tutorial) will continue to work with Power Pages.

We are currently migrating and merging the Power Apps portals documentation with [Power Pages](/power-pages) documentation. You may continue to see some Power Pages features referred to as Power Apps portals during this transition.
