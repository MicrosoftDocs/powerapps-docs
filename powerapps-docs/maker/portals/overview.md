# What is Power Apps portals?

Power Apps makers can now create a powerful new type of experience: external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Common Data Service, or even browse content anonymously. The full capabilities of Dynamics 365 Portals, previously offered only as an add-on to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, are now available completely standalone inside of Power Apps.  

These capabilities feature a revamped end-to-end experience for makers to quickly create a website and customize it with pages, layout, and content. Makers can reuse page designs through templates, add forms and views to display key data from Common Data Service, and publish to users.

> [!NOTE]
> - Power Apps portals are based on Bootstrap 3.3.x with the exception of [Event portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/marketing/developer/event-management-web-application). Portal developers should not replace Bootstrap 3 with other CSS libraries as some of the scenarios in Power Apps portals are dependent on Bootstrap 3.3.x.
> - Certain experiences might have known issues. These issues are mentioned in the [Known issues](known-issues.md) section later in this document.
