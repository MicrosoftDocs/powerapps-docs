# Add a chart created in a model-driven app to a webpage in portal

You add a chart to a webpage by using a Liquid tag named [Chart](../liquid/portals-entity-tags.md#chart). You can add the chart Liquid tag in:

- The **Copy** field on a webpage.
- In the **Source** field on a [Web template](../liquid/store-content-web-templates.md).

![Chart example](../media/dynamics365-chart-example.png "Chart example")

For example, to show leads by source and filtered for only open leads view:

```
<!—Leads by Source – Open Leads -->
{% chart id:"EE3C733D-5693-DE11-97D4-00155DA3B01E" viewid:"00000000-0000-0000-00AA-000010001006" %}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must specify the values for both the `chart id` and the `viewid` parameters to render a chart on a portals webpage.

## Get the ID of a chart

1.	Go to the target entity, for example, **Sales** > **Leads**.
2.	Expand the **Charts** area.
3.	Choose the chart you want.
4.	Select **More Commands**, and then select **Export Chart**.

    ![Export a chart](../media/export-dynamics365-chart.png "Export a chart")

5. Open the XML file of the exported chart in a text editor.
6. Copy the value of the `<visualizationid>` tag.

    ![Get chartid for a chart](../media/dynamics365-chart-chartid.png "Get the chart ID for a chart")

7. Paste the `visualizationid` value into your Liquid chart tag declaration for the chart ID parameter, for example:

    `{% chart id:EE3C733D-5693-DE11-97D4-00155DA3B01E %}`

## Get the ID of a view

You must open the view editor to get the view ID to be used with the Liquid chart tag.
 
1. Go to make.powerapps.com and select the appropriate environment.
1. In the left navigation bar, select Data > Entities.
1. Select the appropriate entity and go to 'Views' tab.
1. You can see the list of views. Go to options (...) and select 'Edit View'.
1. Copy the id value from the View window's address bar.

    ![View ID of the form](../media/dynamics365-chart-viewid.png)

1. Paste this ID into your Liquid chart tag declaration for the viewid parameter, for example:

    ```
    <!—Leads by Source – Open Leads -->
    {% chart id:"EE3C733D-5693-DE11-97D4-00155DA3B01E" viewid:"00000000-0000-0000-00AA-000010001004" %}
    ```

## Entity permission requirement

Read privilege is asserted for the target entity being queried in the chart. For anonymous or authenticated users to be able to view the chart, you must ensure that the appropriate [Entity Permission](assign-entity-permissions.md) records are created and assigned to applicable [web roles](create-web-roles.md). 
 
If permission isn't granted, the user will see an access denied message.

## Other considerations

- Long labels on Horizontal (Category) Axis Label can get overlapped when using a high number of data points on the chart.
- Hovering over currency data types formatting shows values with spaces instead of separators.
- Numeric fields are currently shown in decimal format.
- Horizontal Axis values can show only up-to 15 Labels.
