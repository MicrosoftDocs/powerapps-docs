To get started with configuring your portal, select the relevant option from the left pane.

### Browser considerations

If your web browser has any extensions such as ad-blockers, you may see a script error when using the Portal Management app: `One of the scripts for this record has caused an error. For more details, download the log file.` In addition, the downloaded log file may reference this error: `ReferenceError: Web resource method does not exist.` 

![Script error.](media/configure-portal/script-error.png "Script error") 

This error occurs for forms such as [Web pages](web-page.md), [Basic Forms](entity-forms.md), [Lists](entity-lists.md), or [Advanced Form Steps](web-form-steps.md). To resolve this error, disable extensions such as ad-blockers in your browser. You may also use a different browser instead that doesn't have such extensions enabled.
