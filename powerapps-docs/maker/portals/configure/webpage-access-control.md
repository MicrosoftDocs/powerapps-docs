# Control webpage access for portals

Web page access control rules are rules that you create for your site to control both the publishing actions that a web role can perform across the pages of your website and to control which pages are visible by which web roles. The webpage access entity has the following attributes:


|    Name     |                                                                                                                                                                  Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

After creating a new access control rule, associate it with a page. This will cause it to affect both the page you assign the rule to and all child pages&mdash;in other words, the entire branch of the website.

There are two types of access control rules: Grant Change and Restrict Read.

## Grant Change

Grant Change allows a user in a web role associated with the rule to publish content changes for this page and all child pages of this page. Grant Change takes precedence over restrict read. For example, you might have a news section of the site, which you want to be editable by users in the news editor web role. These users might not have access to the entire site, and certainly can't edit the entire site, but within this branch they have full content publishing authority. You would create a webpage access control rule called grant news publishing to news editors.

Next, you would set the right to grant change and the webpage to the parent page of the entire news branch of your site. You would then assign this web role to any contacts you want to designate as news editors. Note that one user can have many web roles.

A Grant Change rule should always be present in any portal that you wish to enable front-side editing for. This rule will apply to the home page of the site, thus making it the default rule for the entire site. This rule will be associated with a web role that is to represent the administrative role for the site. Users who are to be given front-side content publishing rights will be assigned to this role.

## Restrict read
The Restrict Read rule is used to limit viewing of a page (and its child pages) and its content to specific users. Whereas grant change is a permissive rule (it grants the ability to do something to its users), restrict read is a restrictive rule in that it restricts an action to a limited set of users. For example, you might have a section of the site meant to be used by employees only. You might restrict read of this branch to only people in the employee web role. You would create a new rule called restrict read to employees only.

You would then set the right to restrict read and the page to the page at the top of the branch which is to be read only by employees. You would then associate this rule with the employee web role and then assign users to this role.

> [!Note]
> If you apply the **Restrict Read** right to the root 'home' page of a website and select **Exclude direct child web files** as the **Scope**, the home page's direct child web files will be accessible to all users.
