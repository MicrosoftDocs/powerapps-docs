# Configure WS-Federation provider for portals

A WS-Federationâ€“compliant security token service provider can be added as an identity provider. For example, Azure Active Directory, or single Active Directory Federation Services server. Also, a single [[!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] ACS](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dotnet-how-to-use-access-control/) namespace can be configured as a set of individual identity providers. The settings for both AD FS and ACS are based on the properties of the WsFederationAuthenticationOptions class.

To configure WS-Federation provider:

1. Select [Add provider](use-simplified-authentication-configuration.md#add-configure-or-delete-an-identity-provider) for your portal.

1. Select **Login provider** as **Other**.

1. Select **Protocol** as **WS FED**.

1. Enter a provider name.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Create the application and configure the settings with your identity provider.

1. Enter the following site settings for portal configuration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ensure that you review&mdash;and if required, change&mdash;the default values.

    | Name | Description |
    | - | - |
    | Metadata address | The WS-Federation identity provider metadata file location. <br> Example (Azure AD): `https://login.microsoftonline.com/22a47203-270e-4476-a9fd-189d82e4b467/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml` |
    | Authentication type | The Entity Id value that specifies a globally unique name for the WS-Federation identity provider. <br> Example (Azure AD): `https://login.microsoftonline.com/22a47203-270e-4476-a9fd-189d82e4b467/` |
    | Service provider realm | The portal URL that specifies the service provider realm for the WS-Federation identity provider. <br> Example: `https://contoso-portal.powerappsportals.com/signin-wsfederation_1` <br> **Note**: If you're using the default portal URL, you can copy and paste the **Reply URL** as shown in *Create and configure WS-Federation provider* settings. If you're using a custom domain name, enter the URL manually. However, ensure that the value enter here is exactly the same as the **Redirect URI** value for the application in the Azure portal. |
    | Assertion consumer service URL | The portal URL that corresponds to the service provider's endpoint (URL). |

1. Select **Next**.

1. (Optional) Configure additional settings.

    ![Additional settings](media/authentication/wsfed-site-settings-additional.png "Additional settings")

    | Name | Description
    | - | - |
    | Sign-out reply | The URL to return to (sign-out wreply) once the sign-out is complete. <br> Example: `https://portal.contoso.com/signin-federation` |
    | Valid audiences | Comma-separated list of audience URLs. |
    | Validate audiences | If enabled, the audience will be validated during the token validation. |
    | WHR | The home realm of the identity provider (IdP) to use for authentication. Sets the WS-Federation sign-in request **whr** parameter. If empty, the **whr** parameter isn't included in the request. <br> More information: [wsFederation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/wsfederation) |
    | Contact mapping with email | Specify whether the contacts are mapped to a corresponding email. When set to On, a unique contact record is associated with a matching email address, assigning the external identity provider to the contact after a successful user sign-in. |

1. Select **Confirm**.
