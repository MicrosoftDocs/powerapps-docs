# Configure WS-Federation provider settings for portals

A single [!INCLUDE[pn-active-directory](../../../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] Federation Services server can be added (or another [WS-Federation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb498017.aspx)â€“compliant security token service) as an identity provider. In addition, a single [[!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] ACS](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-dotnet-how-to-use-access-control/) namespace can be configured as a set of individual identity providers. The settings for both AD FS and ACS are based on the properties of the [WsFederationAuthenticationOptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.owin.security.wsfederation.wsfederationauthenticationoptions.aspx) class.
