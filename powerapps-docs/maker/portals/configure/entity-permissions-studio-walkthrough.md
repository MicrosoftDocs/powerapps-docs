# Tutorial: Configure table permissions using portals Studio

In the previous article, you learned how to configure security in portals by using table permissions in the Power Apps portals Studio. This article will walk you through the process with step-by-step instructions using an example scenario.

The goal of this scenario is to show you how to use portals Studio to configure table permissions with a real case study. The scenario showcases using each [access type available in portals Studio](entity-permissions-studio.md#available-access-types-in-studio) to match a real-world business requirement with the relevant Microsoft Dataverse tables and table relationships.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin with this scenario, understand how to use Power Apps portals Studio to configure table permissions. You'll also need a portal and access to the Dataverse environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial does not include configuration of webpages, basic or advanced forms, or Dataverse tables. The focus of this tutorial is the configuration of table permissions using Studio. To create pages and customize them, see [Build portals using portals Studio](../portal-designer-anatomy.md). To create and configure tables in Dataverse, see [Tables in Dataverse](../../data-platform/entity-overview.md).

## Scenario

For this tutorial scenario, let's consider an example of Contoso Limited that deals with buying and selling used cars. Contoso has a B2B (business-to-business) portal to manage the inventory posted by sales staff at car dealerships across the country.

### Roles

Contoso has the following web roles available:

- **Authenticated users** - The default role for all authenticated users
- **Anonymous users** - The default role for all anonymous users
- **Admin** - IT administrators for Contoso
- **Sales** - Sales staff to manage car sales across dealerships
- **Managers** - Managers of the sales and dealership staff

### Tables

Contoso uses the following Dataverse tables for this configuration:

- **Car listings** - Contains listings of all the cars in Contoso inventory across all dealerships
- **Dealerships** - Contains details about all car dealerships along with the address and inventory summary

Along with the above tables, this scenario also uses existing tables such as **Contact** and **Account**.

### Relationships

Contoso has the following relationships configured between tables in Dataverse:

- **Account (One) to Dealerships (Many)** - One account can own multiple dealerships
- **Contact (One) to Car listings (Many)** - One sales staff (contact) can have multiple car listings
- **Dealership (One) to Car listings (Many)** - One dealership can have multiple car listings

### Customizations

Contoso has the following customizations configured for this scenario:

- Lists on webpages have table permissions enabled. More information: [Configure lists](entity-lists.md).
- Webpages have [lists](entity-lists.md) configured with the tables, views, and the ability to create/view/edit/delete records as appropriate.
    - To show [all car listings to all authenticated users](#view-all-car-listings), the webpage has a list with a view from the **Car listings** table with only View record permission. Access type: [Global access](assign-entity-permissions.md#global-access-type).
    - To show, update, and delete [owned car listings](#view-update-and-delete-owned-car-listings), the webpage has a list with a view from the **Car listings** table having View, Create, Edit, and Delete records permissions. Access type: [Contact access](assign-entity-permissions.md#contact-access-type).
    - To show [all car dealerships](#view-all-car-dealerships), the webpage has a list with a view from the **Dealerships** table having View, Create, Edit, and Delete records permissions. Access type: [Account access](assign-entity-permissions.md#account-access-type).
    - To show [car listings for an associated dealership](#view-car-listings-for-associated-dealership), the webpage has a list with a view from the **Dealerships** table. This list can be used to view the dealership details, with a subgrid that shows the listings associated to the selected dealership with View, Create, Edit, and Delete records permissions.
- Default [profile page](#change-profile-details) to allow sales staff to change their contact details. Access type: [Self access](assign-entity-permissions.md#self-access-type).
