# Configure the Azure Active Directory B2C provider manually


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-banner.md)]

This article describes how to configure Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) as the identity provider manually. Use these steps to manually create a new Azure AD B2C tenant, register the application, and configure user flows.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you want to configure the Azure AD B2C provider automatically by using Power Apps portals, go to [Configure Azure AD B2C provider](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider.md).
> - Changes to the authentication settings [might take a few minutes](../admin/clear-server-side-cache.md#caching-changes-for-portals-with-version-926x-or-later) to be reflected on the portal. If you want the changes to be reflected immediately, restart the portal by using [portal actions](../admin/admin-overview.md).

**To configure Azure AD B2C as the OpenID Connect provider manually**

1. Select **Configure** for **Azure Active Directory B2C**. More information: [Configure a provider](use-simplified-authentication-configuration.md#add-or-configure-a-provider)

    ![Azure AD B2C provider name.](media/authentication/azure-ad-b2c-name.png "Azure AD B2C provider name")

1. If necessary, update the name.

1. Select **Skip to manual configuration**.

    ![Skip to manual configuration.](media/authentication/skip-to-manual.png "Skip to manual configuration")

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting **Next** instead of **Skip to manual configuration** takes you to configure the [Azure AD B2C authentication by using the Power Apps portals interface](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider.md).

1. In this step, you create the application and configure the settings with your identity provider.

    ![Configure the Azure AD B2C app.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step1.png "Configure the Azure AD B2C app")

    1. Sign in to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    1. [Create an Azure AD B2C tenant](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant).

    1. [Register an application](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=applications#register-a-web-application) in your tenant.

        1. Search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.

        1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations**.

        1. Select **New registration**.

            ![New app registration.](media/authentication/app-registration-new-b2c.png "New app registration")

        1. Enter a name.

        1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web** (if it isn't selected already).

        1. In the **Redirect URI** text box, enter the **Reply URL** for your portal. <br> Example: `https://contoso-portal.powerappsportals.com/signin-aad-b2c_1`

            > [!NOTE]
            > If you're using the default portal URL, copy and paste the **Reply URL** as shown in the **Create and configure B2C tenant in Azure** section on the **Configure identity provider** screen (step 4 above). If you're using a custom domain name for the portal, enter the custom URL. Be sure to use this value when you configure the **Redirect URL** in your portal settings while configuring the Azure AD B2C provider. <br> For example, if you enter the **Reply URL** in Azure portal as `https://contoso-portal.powerappsportals.com/signin-aad-b2c_1`, you must use it as-is for the Azure AD B2C configuration in portals.

            ![Register application.](media/authentication/register-application-b2c.png "Register application")

        1. Select **Register**.

        1. On the left pane, under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.

            ![Enable implicit grant flow with ID tokens.](media/authentication/access-token.png "Enable implicit grant flow with ID tokens")

        1. Under **Implicit grant**, select the **Access tokens (used for implicit flows)** check box.

        1. Select **Save**.

    1. [Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-sign-up-and-sign-in-user-flow). Optionally, you can [create a password reset user flow](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-password-reset-user-flow).

    1. [Configure token compatibility](/azure/active-directory-b2c/configure-tokens#configure-token-compatibility) by using an **Issuer (iss) claim** URL that includes **tfp**. More information: [Token compatibility](/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview#compatibility)

        ![Configure token compatibility with tfp.](media/authentication/token-compatibility.png "Configure token compatibility with tfp") 

1. In this step, you enter site settings and password reset settings for the portal configuration.

    ![Configure site settings.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step2.png "Configure site settings")

    1. In the **Configure site settings** section, enter the following values:

        - **Authority**: Enter the issuer URL defined in the metadata of the sign-up and sign-in policy user flow.​
        <br>**To get the issuer URL**

           1. Open the sign-up and sign-in user flow you created earlier. For this step, you need to go to the Azure AD B2C tenant on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

              ![Select the user flow.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/user-flow.png "Select the user flow")

           1. Select **Run user flow**.

              ![Run user flow.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/run-user-flow.png "Run user flow")

           1. Select the OpenID configuration URL to open in a new browser window or tab.

               ![Select the OpenID configuration URL.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-openid-configuration-url.png "Select the OpenID configuration URL. Format: https://<B2C-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com/tfp/<B2C-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<user-flow-name>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration")

               The URL refers to the OpenID Connect identity provider configuration document, also known as the *OpenID well-known configuration endpoint*.

           1. Copy the URL of the **Issuer** from the new browser window or tab.

                ![Copy the Issuer URL.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/issuer-url.png "Copy the Issuer URL")

                Ensure that you copy only the URL, without the quotation marks (*""*). <br> For example, `https://contosoorg.b2clogin.com/tfp/799f7b50-f7b9-49ec-ba78-67eb67210998/b2c_1_contoso/v2.0/`

                > [!TIP]
                > Ensure that the **Issuer (iss) claim** URL includes **tfp**.

        - **Client ID​**: Enter the **Application ID** of the Azure AD B2C application you created earlier.

        - **Redirect URI**: Enter the portal URL. <br> You only need to change the redirect URI if you're using a custom domain name.

    1. In the **Password reset settings**section, enter the following values:

        - **Default policy ID**: Enter the name of the sign-up and sign-in user flow you created earlier. The name is prefixed with *B2C_1*.

        - **Password reset policy ID**: Enter the name of the password reset user flow you created earlier. The name is prefixed with *B2C_1*.

        - **Valid issuers**: Enter a comma-delimited list of issuer URLs for the sign-up and sign-in user flow, and password reset user flow, you created earlier. 
        <br> To get the issuer URLs for the sign-up and sign-in user flow, and the password reset user flow, open each flow and then follow the steps under **Authority**, in step 5a earlier in this article.

1. In this step, you have the option of configuring additional settings for the Azure AD B2C identity provider.

    ![Configure additional settings.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step3.png "Configure additional settings")

    - **Registration claims mapping​**: Not required if using *email*, *first name*, or *last name* attributes. For additional attributes, enter a list of logical name/claim pairs to be used to map claim values returned from Azure AD B2C (created during sign-up) to attributes in the contact record. <br> Format: `field_logical_name=jwt_attribute_name`, where `field_logical_name` is the logical name of the field in portals and `jwt_attribute_name` is the attribute with the value returned from the identity provider. <br> 
     For example, if you've enabled **Job Title (jobTitle)** and **Postal Code (postalCode)** as **User Attributes** in your user flow, and you want to update the corresponding Contact table fields **Job Title (jobtitle)** and **Address 1: ZIP / Postal Code (address1_postalcode)**, enter the claims mapping as ```jobtitle=jobTitle,address1_postalcode=postalCode```.

    - **Login claims mapping**: Not required if using *email*, *first name*, or *last name* attributes. For additional attributes, enter a list of logical name/claim pairs to be used to map claim values returned from Azure AD B2C after sign-in to the attributes in the contact record. <br> Format: `field_logical_name=jwt_attribute_name` where `field_logical_name` is the logical name of the field in portals, and `jwt_attribute_name` is the attribute with the value returned from the identity provider. <br> 
     For example, if you've enabled **Job Title (jobTitle)** and **Postal Code (postalCode)** as **Application Claims** in your user flow, and you want to update the corresponding Contact table fields **Job Title (jobtitle)** and **Address 1: ZIP / Postal Code (address1_postalcode)**, enter the claims mapping as ```jobtitle=jobTitle,address1_postalcode=postalCode```.

    - **External logout**: Choose whether to enable or disable federated sign-out:
      - Select **On** to redirect users to the federated sign-out user experience when they sign out from the portal.
      - Select **Off** to simply sign users out from the portal.

    - **Contact mapping with email**: Specify whether contacts are mapped to a corresponding email. Turn on this toggle to associate a unique contact record with a matching email address and then automatically assign the external identity provider to the contact after the user successfully signs in.

    - **Registration enabled**:- Turn [open registration](configure-portal-authentication.md#open-registration) for your portal on or off. Turning off this toggle disables and hides external account registration.

1. Select **Confirm** to view a summary of your settings and complete the identity provider configuration.
