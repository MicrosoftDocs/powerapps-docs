# Configure the Azure Active Directory B2C provider (using interface in preview)


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

[!include[Azure](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Active Directory (Azure AD) powers Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 services for employee or internal authentication. [!include[Azure](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is an extension to this authentication model that enables external customers to sign in through local credentials and federation with various common social identity providers.

A portal owner can configure the portal [!include[Azure](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] AD B2C as an identity provider. [!include[Azure](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] AD B2C supports Open ID Connect for federation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes how to configure Azure AD B2C as the identity provider automatically by using a feature in preview. Using these steps, you can create a new Azure AD B2C tenant, register applications, and configure user flows from within Power Apps portals. If you want to configure the Azure AD B2C provider manually using the generally available interface, go to [Configure the Azure AD B2C provider manually](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider-manual.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to the authentication settings [might take a few minutes](../admin/clear-server-side-cache.md#caching-changes-for-portals-with-version-926x-or-later) to be reflected on the portal. If you want the changes to be reflected immediately, restart the portal by using [portal actions](../admin/admin-overview.md).

Follow these steps to configure Azure AD B2C as the OpenID Connect provider.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Step 1. Select the provider

1. Go to [Power Apps preview](https://make.preview.powerapps.com).

1. On the left pane, select **Apps**.

    ![Select Apps.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-apps.png "Select Apps")

1. Select your portal from the list of available apps.

1. On the command bar, select **Settings**.<br>or<br>Select **More Commands** (**...**), and then select **Settings**.

    ![Select Settings.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-settings.png "Select Settings")

1. In **Portal settings** on the right side of your workspace, select **Authentication Settings**.

    ![Authentication Settings.](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/portal-settings-right-pane.png "Authentication Settings")

1. For **Azure Active Directory B2C**, select **Configure**.

    ![Configure Azure AD B2C.](media/authentication/configure-adb2c.png "Configure Azure AD B2C")

1. If necessary, update the **Provider name**.

    ![Azure AD B2C provider name.](media/authentication/azure-ad-b2c-name.png "Azure AD B2C provider name")

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 2. Select a tenant

In this step, you select an existing Azure AD B2C tenant or create a new one.

![Select or create an Azure AD B2C tenant.](media/authentication/azure-adb2c-select-tenant.png "Select or create an Azure AD B2C tenant")

### Option 1. Existing Azure AD B2C tenant

Select this option if you already have an existing Azure AD B2C tenant. Other details such as the initial domain name, country/region, and location will be automatically updated.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the account you use to sign in to Power Apps has access to the Azure AD tenant that you want to use for configuring Azure AD B2C authentication. For information about adding different types of user accounts to an Azure AD B2C tenant, go to [Overview of user accounts in Azure Active Directory B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-overview).

![Select an existing Azure AD B2C tenant.](media/authentication/b2c-tenant-select.png "Select an existing Azure AD B2C tenant")

Select **Next** to continue.

### Option 2. New Azure AD B2C tenant

Select this option to create a new Azure AD B2C tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> - Ensure that the account you use to sign in to Power Apps has been assigned at least the [Contributor role](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) for the subscription or for a resource group within the subscription.
> - Ensure the Azure subscription has the **Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory** resource provider registered. Otherwise, creating the new Azure AD B2C tenant will fail with this error:
> <br> `Error occurred while creating Azure AD B2C tenant. The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory'. See https://aka.ms/rps-not-found for how to register subscriptions.` More information: [Resolve errors for resource provider registration in Azure](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-register-resource-provider)

<!--markdownlint-disable MD036-->
**To create a new Azure AD B2C tenant**
<!--markdownlint-enable MD036-->

1. Select the Azure AD tenant or directory.

1. Select a subscription for the tenant, or&mdash;if you want to create a new subscription from the Azure portal&mdash;select **Add subscription**.

1. Select the resource group for the Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Enter the initial domain name.

1. Select **Country/Region** for the tenant.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - You can't change the country/region after you create your directory.
    > - It's important that you select the correct country/region, because your choice determines the **Datacenter location** for your directory.
    > - Microsoft doesn't control the location from which you or your users can access or move directory data through apps or services. To see Microsoft's data location commitments for its services, see the [Online Service Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=2009014).

    ![New Azure AD B2C tenant details.](media/authentication/create-new-b2c-tenant.png "New Azure AD B2C tenant details")

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 3. Register the application

In this step, you register your portal as an application with Azure AD. You can create a new application or select an existing application from Azure AD.

![Register the application.](media/authentication/register-app-b2c.png "Register the application")

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a custom domain name for the portal, enter the custom URL as the **Reply URL**.

### Option 1. Create a new application

1. Enter the application name.

1. Enter a **Reply URL**.

    ![New application.](media/authentication/new-application-b2c.png "New application")

1. Select **Next**.

### Option 2. Select an existing application

1. Select an existing application from the list.

1. Select the **Reply URL**.<br>or<br>Select **Create new** to create a new **Reply URL**.

    ![Existing application.](media/authentication/existing-application-b2c.png "Existing application")

1. Select **Next**.

## Step 4. Configure user flows

In this step, you configure the **Sign up and sign in** and **Password reset** user flows. The **Sign up and sign in** user flow enables a user to create an account or sign in to their account. The **Password reset** flow enables a user to choose a new password after email verification. More information: [User flow and policy in Azure AD B2C](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview#user-flow-versions)

![Configure user flows.](media/authentication/b2c-user-flows.png "Configure user flows")

- **New policy**: Select this option if you want to create a new policy. You can also change the default name of the policy. This option creates the flow by using the *local account* identity provider with the email address.
- **Existing policy**: Select this option if you want to select an existing policy from the Azure AD B2C tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> - Only the email claim is configured in these user flows. You can enable more claims&mdash;like *first name* and *last name*&mdash;in the flow's **User attributes** and **Application claims** configuration by using the Azure portal. 
> - If you enable more claims in addition to *first name* and *last name*, ensure that you [edit the authentication provider](#edit-the-configuration) and add them to the *Registration claims mapping* and *Login claims mapping* in **Additional settings** (this isn't required for *first name* and *last name*). More information: [Step 6 - additional settings for Azure AD B2C provider configuration](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider-manual.md)

Select **Create** to create the identity provider configuration.

## Step 5. Summary

The Azure AD B2C provider configuration is complete. You can view the summary of the configuration, and then select **Close** to exit.

![View summary and close.](media/authentication/b2c-summary.png "View summary and close")
