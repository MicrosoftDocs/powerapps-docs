# Walkthrough: Configuring additional entities for global search  

## Overview

You can enable additional entities for search functionality. Configuring search for additional entities requires additional actions.

Following considerations apply when configuring additional entities for global search:

- Ensure [site settings](#site-setting-for-additional-entities) for search on additional entities is enabled.
- Create a named view **Portal Search** for additional entity you want to enable search for. For more information, read [searchable fields in global search](search.md#fields-searchable-in-global-search).
- Ensure an **Entity Permission** is created that provides Read privilege, and appropriate scope for the records to show search results.
- Associate the entity permission with required **Web Roles**.
- Entity permissions must be associated with the **Anonymous Web Role** if you want to allow anonymous search for an entity.
- Configure [search results page](#results-page-for-additional-entities) to display search results.

Explicit configuration explained above ensures that no records are accidentally made available via global search.

### Site Setting for additional entities

Site setting **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is required when configuring additional entities for search.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is explicitly for enabling additional entities search. The main search site setting **Search/Enabled** must be set to **true** when using search functionality.

You can also configure other related site settings similar to the search configuration for default entities. 

For example, **Search/Filters** allow configuring the additional entities and add a drop-down filter option to the global search.

For more information about site settings, read [site setting](search.md#related-site-settings).

### Results page for additional entities

The search result page is configured via a **Site Marker** named ```<entitylogicalname>_SearchResultPage```.

For example, if your entity logical name is *nwind_products* then the Site Marker will be ```nwind_products_SearchResultPage```. The value of the site marker is the page that you want to open on click of that search result. By default, record ID is passed in the *id* querystring parameter to the search result page.

Ensure that your search results page has an entity form. Or has logic written to show the search result details.

## Walkthrough - configure search for additional entities with sample database

The following walk-through explains enabling search for **Order Products** entity in sample database **Northwind** available with Common Data Service.

For more information about sample database, read [Install Northwind Traders database and apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/northwind-install).

> [!TIP]
> You can follow the walk-through with your entity instead by replacing *nwind_products* entity name with your entity's logical name.

1. Ensure you are on the appropriate environment where your portal exists.

1. Select **Apps** in the left pane and locate the **Portal Management** model-driven app:
