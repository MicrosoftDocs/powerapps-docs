# Walk-through: Configuring additional tables for global search  


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

## Overview

You can enable additional tables for search functionality. Configuring search for additional tables requires additional actions, which are described in this article. These explicit configuration steps ensure that no records will accidentally be made available using global search.

## Steps to configure search for additional tables

To configure search for additional tables:

1. [Enable additional tables search](#step-1-add-or-update-search-site-settings) for the first time by adding a new setting [Search/EnableAdditionalEntities](#site-setting-for-additional-tables) and set it to *true*. This is a one-time step that enables search for all additional out-of-the-box and custom tables.

1. [Create Portal Search view](#step-2-create-or-verify-the-portal-search-view) for each additional table with the required filters and columns that needs to be searchable.

1. [Configure table permissions](#step-3-create-table-permissions) for each additional table with a Web Role to have at least read privilege. Skip this step if you already have the read permissions configured for each table.

1. [Create a record details page](#step-4-add-record-details-webpage) for each table to show the [details of the selected record](#site-marker-for-record-details-page) from the search results page. Skip this step if you already have created separate results record details page for each table.

1. [Create a site marker](#step-5-add-a-site-marker-for-record-details-webpage) named `<entitylogicalname>_SearchResultPage` for each table with the associated [record details page](#site-marker-for-record-details-page).

1. [Rebuild the search index](#step-6-rebuild-the-search-index).

1. [Verify the search results](#step-7-verify-that-global-search-works-with-the-custom-table).

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't create a record details page, or if you don't bind the record details page with site marker for search, you won't be able to select the additional table records from search results page to view the record details.

### Site setting for additional tables

The site setting **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is required when configuring additional tables for search.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is explicitly for enabling search for additional tables. The main search site setting **Search/Enabled** must be set to **true** when using search functionality.

You can also configure other related site settings similar to the search configuration for default tables. For example, you can use the **Search/Filters** setting to configure additional tables and add a drop-down filter option to the global search. More information: [Site setting](search.md#related-site-settings).

### Site marker for record details page

The record details page is configured using a **Site Marker** named `<entitylogicalname>_SearchResultPage`.

For example, if your table logical name is *nwind_products*, the site marker will be `nwind_products_SearchResultPage`. The value of the site marker is the record details page that you want to open when that search result is selected. By default, a record ID is passed in the *id* querystring parameter to the record details page. For more information about adding forms on a page, go to [Compose a page](../add-form.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that your record details page has a basic form, or has logic written to show the search result details. For example, [Step 4 - Add record details page](#step-4-add-record-details-webpage) in the following walkthrough.

The following walkthrough explains each step in detail with a sample database and solution to configure search for additional tables.

> [!NOTE]
> - This walkthrough explains how to enable search for the **Order Products** table in the sample database **Northwind**, available with Microsoft Dataverse. For more information about sample databases, see [Install Northwind Traders database and apps](../../canvas-apps/northwind-install.md).
> - You can follow the walkthrough with a table of your choice by replacing the *nwind_products* table name with your table's logical name.

## Step 1: Add or update search site settings

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Ensure that you're in the appropriate environment where your portal exists.

1. Select **Apps** in the left navigation pane, and locate the **Portal Management** model-driven app.  

    ![Portal Management.](media/search-additional-entities/portal-management.png "Portal Management")

1. Select to open the **Portal Management** app, and then go to **Site Settings** in the left navigation pane.

1. Create a new setting, **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities**, and set its value to **true**.
