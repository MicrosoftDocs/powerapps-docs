# Walkthrough: Configuring additional entities for global search  

## Overview

You can enable additional entities for search functionality. Configuring search for additional entities requires additional actions, which are described in this article. These explicit configuration steps ensure that no records will accidentally be made available using global search.

## Steps to configure search for additional entities

To configure search for additional entities:

1. [Enable additional entities search](#step-1-add-or-update-search-site-settings) for the first time by adding a new setting [Search/EnableAdditionalEntities](#site-setting-for-additional-entities) and set it to *true*. This is a one-time step that enables search for all additional out-of-the-box and custom entities.

1. [Create Portal Search view](#step-2-create-or-verify-the-portal-search-view) for each additional entity with the required filters and columns that needs to be searchable.

1. [Configure entity permissions](#step-3-create-entity-permissions) for each additional entity with a Web Role to have at least read privilege. Skip this step if you already have the read permissions configured for each entity.

1. [Create a record details page](#step-4-add-record-details-webpage) for each entity to show the [details of the selected record](#site-marker-for-record-details-page) from the search results page. Skip this step if you already have created separate results record details page for each entity.

1. [Create a site marker](#step-5-add-a-site-marker-for-record-details-webpage) named `<entitylogicalname>_SearchResultPage` for each entity with the associated [record details page](#site-marker-for-record-details-page).

1. [Rebuild the search index](#step-6-rebuild-the-search-index).

1. [Verify the search results](#step-7-verify-that-global-search-works-with-the-custom-entity).

> [!WARNING]
> If you don't create a record details page, or if you don't bind the record details page with site marker for search, you won't be able to select the additional entity records from search results page to view the record details.

### Site setting for additional entities

The site setting **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is required when configuring additional entities for search.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Search/EnableAdditionalEntities** is explicitly for enabling search for additional entities. The main search site setting **Search/Enabled** must be set to **true** when using search functionality.

You can also configure other related site settings similar to the search configuration for default entities. For example, you can use the **Search/Filters** setting to configure additional entities and add a drop-down filter option to the global search. More information: [Site setting](search.md#related-site-settings).

### Site marker for record details page

The record details page is configured using a **Site Marker** named `<entitylogicalname>_SearchResultPage`.

For example, if your entity logical name is *nwind_products*, the site marker will be `nwind_products_SearchResultPage`. The value of the site marker is the record details page that you want to open when that search result is selected. By default, a record ID is passed in the *id* querystring parameter to the record details page. For more information about adding forms on a page, go to [Compose a page](../compose-page.md#add-form).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that your record details page has an entity form, or has logic written to show the search result details. For example, [Step 4 - Add record details page](#step-4-add-record-details-webpage) in the following walkthrough.

The following walkthrough explains each step in detail with a sample database and solution to configure search for additional entities.

> [!NOTE]
> - This walkthrough explains how to enable search for the **Order Products** entity in the sample database **Northwind**, available with Common Data Service. For more information about sample databases, see [Install Northwind Traders database and apps](../../canvas-apps/northwind-install.md).
> - You can follow the walkthrough with an entity of your choice by replacing the *nwind_products* entity name with your entity's logical name.
