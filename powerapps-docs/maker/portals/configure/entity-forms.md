# About basic forms

A data-driven configuration to allow end users to add a form to collect data in the portal without the need for a developer to surface the form in the portal, basic forms are created in Microsoft Dataverse and then placed into webpages in the portal or used in conjunction with subgrids and lists to build out complete web applications. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [About lists](entity-lists.md) 

![Contact us form.](../media/contact-us-form.png "Contact us form")  

## Add a form to your portal

The basic form contains relationships to webpages and additional properties to control the initialization of the form within the portal. The relationship to webpages allows dynamic retrieval of the form definition for a given page node within the website. 

To view existing basic forms or to create new basic forms, open the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md) and go to **Portals** &gt; **Basic Forms**.

When creating a new basic form, the first step is to decide the **Table** and **Form Name** that you will be rendering, in addition to the **mode: Insert, Edit, or Read Only**. The mode selected will determine if you are creating a new record from the portal, editing an existing record, or just displaying information about a record on the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> - A **Basic Form** must be associated with a webpage for a given website for the form to be viewable within the site.
> - The Connection table subgrids aren't supported in basic forms. If you add a Connection table subgrid to the form using Form designer, error messages are displayed when you render the form on the portal and use the Connection table.
> - Duplicate fields, multi-select option set, Party List fields and business rules aren't supported in basic forms.
> - Field level code components are in public preview, and can be added to forms. More information: [Add a code component to a field in a model-driven app](../component-framework.md#add-a-code-component-to-a-field-in-a-model-driven-app) 
> - [Image attributes](../../../developer/data-platform/image-attributes.md), [file attributes](../../../developer/data-platform/file-attributes.md) and [table images](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/sample-set-retrieve-entity-images) aren't supported in [basic forms](entity-forms.md), [advanced forms](web-form-properties.md) or when using liquid template tags, such as [fetchxl](../liquid/template-tags.md).
> - Business rules and client API can enable locked fields on a read-only form.
> - If you create a basic form in the Insert mode, you can't change a button's alignment or place an action button above the basic form.
> - If you render a lookup control as a dropdown list on the form, the related records filter does not work.

The webpages associated with the basic form can be viewed by selecting the **Web Pages** link listed in the **Related** navigation links in the leftmost menu.

When creating or editing a webpage, an **Basic Form** can be specified in the lookup field provided on the Web Page form.

The various master pages used by the portal contain declarations of the **TableForm** server control. When rendering the webpage containing either the Page (~/Pages/Page.aspx) page template or Full Page (~/Pages/FullPage.aspx) page template, the controls will determine whether the basic form lookup contains a value, in which case the form will be rendered.

## Secure your forms

>[!NOTE]
> This method of securing forms would be deprecated soon. Therefore, it shouldn't be used. Use proper [table permissions](entity-permissions-studio.md), and web role setup to provide access to users for any data instead. More information: [Table permission changes for forms and lists on new portals](../important-changes-deprecations.md#table-permission-changes-for-forms-and-lists-on-new-portals)

To secure your forms, you must create table permissions that determine access and ownership of the records according to web roles. If a user lands on a basic form and does not have permissions, they will receive an error message. To enable permissions for a basic form, set **Enable Table Permissions** to true. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create web roles for portals](create-web-roles.md).  

## Basic form attributes and relationships

|Name|Description|
|-----|----------|
|Name|The descriptive name of the record. This field is required.|

|Tab Name|    Optional name of a Tab on a Form for a specified table that is to be rendered.|
|Mode|One of the following values:<ul><li>Insert</li><li>Edit</li><li>ReadOnly</li></ul>Selecting _Insert_ indicates the form should insert a new record upon submission. Specifying _Edit_ indicates the form should edit an existing record. Selecting _ReadOnly_ indicates the form should display an existing record's non editable form. _Edit_ and _ReadOnly_ requires that a source record exist and parameters specified in the 'Record Source Type' and 'Record ID Parameter Name' fields to select the appropriate record when the form is loaded in the portal.|
|Record Source Type|One of the following values:<ul><li>Query String</li><li>Current Portal User</li><li>Record Associated to Current Portal User</li></ul>Selecting _Query String_ requires a parameter name that must be provided in the query string of the URL to the form. This can be specified in the 'Record ID Parameter Name' field.<br>Selecting _Current Portal User_ will retrieve the portal user record for the current authenticated user.<br>Selecting _Record Associated to Current Portal User_ will retrieve the portal user record for the current authenticated user and then retrieve the record for the given relationship as specified by the 'Relationship Name' field.|
|Record ID Parameter Name|    A parameter name provided in the query string of the URL to the Web Page containing this Basic Form.|
|Relationship Name|    Required when Record Source Type is Record Associated to Current Portal User. The logical name of the relationship between the current portal user record and the target record. This must return the same table type specified by the Table Name field.|
|Allow Create If Null|    An optional boolean value available when Record Source Type is Record Associated to Current Portal User. Indicates that if the related record does not exist, allow the user to create it the first time, otherwise an exception will be thrown if the record does not already exist as the form needs a record to data bind to.|
|Enable Table Permissions|    Will Cause the form to respect Table Permissions. The default is false for backwards compatibility reasons. If set to true, explicit permissions are REQUIRED for any user wanting to access the form. <br> **NOTE**: This method of securing forms would be deprecated soon. Therefore, it shouldn't be used. Use proper [table permissions](entity-permissions-studio.md), and web role setup to provide access to users for any data instead.

|Attach File |  Select to have the form include a file upload control at the bottom of the form to allow a file to be attached to the record. <br> **Note**: Portals with [version 9.2.2.x and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4541765/power-apps-portals-version-9-2-2-x-release) do not require enabling **Enable Table Permissions** on the basic form to attach files. However, if you have it selected, you must ensure that appropriate privileges are provided on the parent table and the annotation table to display the **Attach File** button on the form. Annotation table must have at least **Create** and **Append** privileges and the parent table must have the corresponding **AppendTo** privilege. Depending on whether you have a create or update form, you may also need **Create**, **Read** and **Write** privileges to complete the scenario of the form. |

|Maximum File Size (in kilobytes)|    Forces validation on the maximum allowed size of the uploaded file.|
|File Size Error Message|    The message displayed during form validation if Maximum File Size (in kilobytes) is true and the user has attempted to upload a file that is too large. For each language pack installed and enabled for the organization a field will be available to enter the message in the associated language.|
|Custom JavaScript|    A custom block of JavaScript that will added to the bottom of the page just before the closing form tag element. The HTML input id of a table field is set to the logical name of the attribute. This makes selecting a field, setting values, or other client-side manipulation easy with jQuery.<br>`$(document).ready(function() {   $("#address1_stateorprovince").val("Saskatchewan");});`|
|||

### Associated Table Reference

The following parameters pertain to setting an associated table reference when the form is saved.

This provides a way to associate the current record being created or updated by the form with another target record. This is useful if you have multiple steps with multiple table types and wish to relate the resulting records or if the page is passed a query string of a record id that you would like associated. For example we have a careers page that lists job postings, each with a link to an application for the job that contains the id of the job posting to the application form so that when the application is created the job posting is associated with the record. 

|Name|Description|
|-----|---------|
|Set Table Reference On Save|Yes or No. A value of yes indicates that an associated table reference should be assigned when the form is saved, otherwise none will be set.|
|Relationship Name|The Relationship Definition Name for a given relationship between two table types.|
|Table Logical Name|The logical name of the reference table.|
|Target Lookup Attribute Logical Name|Logical name of the lookup attribute on the target table being created or updated.|
|Populate Lookup Field|    If the lookup regarding the reference table is on the form, checking this value will populate the field on the form with the value retrieved using the setting below.|
|Source Type|    One of the following values:<ul><li>Query String <br> Selecting _Query String_ requires a parameter name that must be provided in the query string of the URL to the form. This can be specified in the **Query String Name** field. If this parameter is the primary key then select Yes for the **Query String Is Primary Key**, otherwise select No and provide the logical name of the attribute on the target table to query by specified in the **Query Attribute Logical Name** field.</li><li>Current Portal User <br> Selecting Current Portal User will retrieve the contact record for the current authenticated user.</li></ul>|
|Reference Table Step|    The Advanced Form Step record of a previous step to retrieve the Table created or edited in that step to associate it with the record for this current step.|
|Query String Name|    Parameter name provided in the Query String of the URL to the Web Page containing the Advanced Form.|
|Query String Is Primary Key|    Yes indicates the Query String value is the Primary Key value. No indicates the Query String value is an attribute type other than the Primary Key.|
|Query Attribute Logical Name|    Logical name of the attribute to query the record.|
|Show ReadOnly Details|    Indicates that a form should be rendered at the top of the page displaying read-only information pertaining to the reference record. Requires a Form Name.|
|Form Name|    The name of the form on the reference table that should be used to display read-only details.|

## Basic form action configuration

By default a Basic Form will allow for reading or updating of an existing record, or the insertion of a new record.  However, you can easily enable and configure additional actions for records in a Basic Form  as well (Delete, Activate, Deactivate, etc.). It is also possible to override default labels, sizes, and other attributes that will appear if there are actions enabled.

These settings are found in the **Additional Settings** section of the basic form. By default, only **Basic Settings** are shown. You can select **Advanced Settings** to show additional settings.

You can add action buttons for the actions that are applicable for an individual record and will appear for each row in the grid provided the appropriate privilege has been granted by [table permissions](assign-entity-permissions.md). The following actions are available:

- Delete
- Workflow
- Create Related Record
- Activate
- Deactivate

Clicking on one of these options displays a configuration area for that action. Furthermore, certain tables have special actions that are available to them on a per-table basis:

- Calculate Value of Opportunity (opportunity)
- Cancel Case Action (incident)
- Close (resolve) Case Action (incident)
- Convert Quote to Order (quote)
- Convert Order to Invoice (salesorder)
- Generate Quote from Opportunity (opportunity)
- Lose Opportunity Action (opportunity)
- Win Opportunity Action (opportunity)
- Reopen Case Action (incident)
- Set Opportunity on Hold (opportunity)

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommend to create a workflow instead of adding an **Activate** or a **Deactivate** button for out of the box tables having defined specific **state** and **status code** values that they require for their business processes. For example, Incident ([status options](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/incident#statuscode-options)), Opportunity([status options](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/opportunity#statuscode-options)), Entitlements ([status options](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/entitlement#statuscode-options)).

## Geolocation configuration for basic forms

A managed form can be configured to display a map control to either display an existing location as a pin on a map or to provide the ability for the user to specify a location. See [Add Geolocation](add-geolocation.md).

The form's map control requires additional configuration to tell it what the IDs of the various location fields are, to assign values to them or retrieve values from them. The basic form record has a configuration section that defines these field mappings that you must specify. The field names will vary depending on the schema you have created.

![Geolocation data in basic form.](../media/geolocation-managed-form.png "Geolocation data in basic form") 

> [!Note]
> - The address field in a read-only basic form is replaced with the map when geolocation is enabled.
> - The Geolocation section is not visible in the German Sovereign Cloud environment. If a user has enabled geolocation by using a different form, it will not be displayed during rendering on portal.

## Request validation

[Request validation](/aspnet/whitepapers/request-validation), a feature of ASP.NET since version 1.1, prevents the server from accepting content containing un-encoded HTML. This feature is designed to help prevent some script-injection attacks whereby client script code or HTML can be unknowingly submitted to a server, stored, and then presented to other users. We still strongly recommend that you validate all input data and HTML encode it when appropriate.

By default, request validation is enabled on portal resulting in following generic error if you enter script code without HTML encoding inside basic form fields:

`Found field(s) submitted with potentially dangerous value(s) such as HTML, or script. Please review the field value(s) and try again.`

To disable request validation, follow these steps:

1. Go to [portal settings](../manage-existing-portals.md#settings) and select **Site Settings**.

1. Select **New**.

1. Type the name as **DisableValidationWebTemplate**.

1. Select appropriate web site record.

1. Type the value as **true**. By default, setting is **false** that enables request validation.

1. Type appropriate description.

1. Select **Save & Close**.

> [!CAUTION]
> When request validation is disabled, content can be submitted to a page. You must ensure that content is properly encoded or processed.
