# Configure Basic form subgrids


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

If the Microsoft Dataverse form used for a basic form has an embedded subgrid, a read-only subgrid will appear on the page and display the corresponding records in a read-only list. A user must have the appropriate [table permissions](assign-entity-permissions.md) in order to see the list of related records.

To configure [list](list-configuration.md) capabilities such as create, update, delete, and other features on the subgrid on the form, you'll need to create a [basic form metadata record](configure-basic-form-metadata.md).

## Add subgrid metadata to your form

To add subgrid metadata to a basic form, go to **Basic Form Metadata** by using either the top drop-down list or the subgrid on the main form of the record that you're working with. More information: [Define basic forms](entity-forms.md).

To add a new record, select **Add New Basic Form Metadata**.

To edit an existing record, select the record in the grid. Selecting **Subgrid** as the **Type** value displays another attribute, **Subgrid Name**.


|     Name     |                                                       Description                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subgrid Name | The unique name of the subgrid on the table's related form. |
|              |                                                                                                                          |

Selecting the subgrid in the form editor will display a properties window. This contains a **Name** field that should be used to assign to the **Subgrid Name** field on the Basic Form Metadata record.

Specifying a valid subgrid name will display the subgrid configuration settings. By default, only **Basic Settings** are shown. Select **Advanced Settings** to show more settings.

By default, most settings are shown collapsed to save space. Select **** to expand a section and see additional options. Select **** to collapse the section.

See below for details about each action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Item Actions               | Use to add action buttons for actions that are applicable for an individual record and will appear in each row in the subgrid, provided the associated privilege has been granted by [Table Permissions](assign-entity-permissions.md). The available actions are: <ul><li>Details</li><li>Edit</li><li>Delete</li><li>Workflow</li><li>Disassociate</li></ul> Selecting on one of these options displays a configuration area for that action. See below for details about each action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

See also Grid Column Width Style. To override settings on a column, select **Column** and fill in the details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Create action

Enabling a **Create action** renders a button above the subgrid that, when selected, opens a dialog box with an [basic form](entity-forms.md) that allows a user to create a new record.  

### Create action settings

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Basic Form           | Specifies the [basic forms and custom logic](entity-forms.md) that will be used to create the new record.

If no basic form is supplied for the Create action, it will be ignored and the button won't be rendered on the subgrid's basic form.                                |
