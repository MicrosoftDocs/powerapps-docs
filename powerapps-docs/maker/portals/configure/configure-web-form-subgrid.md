# Configure Web form subgrids for portals

Web form subgrids are configured in an identical fashion to entity form subgrids: first, create a metadata record for the Web form step that has a subgrid, and then add configuration metadata.

Adding subgrids to your managed forms on the portal is easy—just add the subgrid to the form that you are managing by using the out-of-the-box form designer, and you’re done. The grid will use the view that is specified in Common Data Service form designer, show only related records if that option was chosen, optionally show a search bar, and even respect [entity permissions for portals](assign-entity-permissions.md). It doesn't get any simpler to display a read-only list of records. To enable actions for the grid— Create, Update, Delete, and so on—you must configure those actions by using metadata configuration.

## Add subgrid metadata to your form

To add subgrid metadata to an entity form, go to **Entity Form Metadata** by using either the top drop-down list or the subgrid on the main form of the record that you are working with. More information: [Define entity forms](entity-forms.md).

To add a new record, select **Add New Entity Form Metadata**.

To edit an existing record, select the record in the grid. Selecting **Subgrid** as the **Type** value displays another attribute, **Subgrid Name**.


|     Name     |                                                       Description                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subgrid Name | The unique name of the subgrid on the entity's related form. |
|              |                                                                                                                          |

Selecting the subgrid in the form editor will display a properties window. This contains a **Name** field that should be used to assign to the **Subgrid Name** field on the Entity Form Metadata record.

![Add subgrid metadata](../media/add-subgrid-metadata.png "Add subgrid metadata")  

Specifying a valid subgrid name will display the subgrid configuration settings. By default, only **Basic Settings** are shown. Select **Advanced Settings** to show additional settings.

By default, most settings are shown collapsed to save space. Select **** to expand a section and see additional options. Select **** to collapse the section.

See below for details about each action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Create action

Enabling a **Create action** renders a button above the subgrid that, when selected, opens a dialog box with an [entity form](entity-forms.md) that allows a user to create a new record.  

### Create action settings

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Entity Form           | Specifies the [entity forms and custom logic](entity-forms.md) that will be used to create the new record.

If no entity form is supplied for the Create action, it will be ignored and the button will not be rendered on the subgrid's entity form.                                |
