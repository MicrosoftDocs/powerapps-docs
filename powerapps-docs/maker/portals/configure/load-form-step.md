# Define a load form and load tab step type

This step type allows the advanced form step to act as a basic form within the overall advanced form process. It loads a form with a similar set of options available as a Basic Form.

Specifying Edit indicates the form should edit an existing record. Selecting ReadOnly indicates the form should display an existing record's noneditable form. Edit and ReadOnly requires that a source record exist and parameters specified in the 'Record Source Type' and 'Record ID Parameter Name' fields to select the appropriate record when the form is loaded in the portal.  |
| Auto Generate Steps From Tabs         | Checked indicates that multiple tabs on a basic form will be displayed with each tab as a sequential step starting with the first tab and continue until all tabs have been navigated to and upon final submission a record is inserted. Unchecked is the default behavior. Unchecked value indicates that only one tab or form is to be rendered for the current step. If the Tab Name is not specified, the first tab is displayed.                                              |

| Record ID Parameter Name | A parameter name provided in the query string of the URL to the Web Page containing this Basic Form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Relationship Name                     | Required when Record Source Type is Record Associated to Current Portal User.

| Allow Create If Null                  | An optional Boolean value available when Record Source Type is Record Associated to Current Portal User. Checked indicates that if the related record does not exist, allow the user to create it the first time, otherwise an exception will be thrown if the record does not already exist because the form needs a record to data-bind to.                                                                                                                                        |
| Enable Table Permissions             | Will cause the form to respect Table Permissions. The default is false for backwards compatibility reasons. If set to true, explicit permissions are REQUIRED for any user wanting to access the form. Note that this only applies to the FIRST step of a form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Associate the current portal user with the creation of a record

These options are used to keep track of which portal contact creates a record through the portal UI

| Name                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Associate Current Portal User              | Checked indicates the currently logged in user's record should be associated with the target table record.                                                                             |

||

## Associated table reference

The following parameters pertain to setting an associated table reference when the form is saved.

This provides a way to associate the current record being created or updated by the form with another target record. This is useful if you have multiple steps with multiple table types and wish to relate the resulting records or if the page is passed a query string of a record ID that you would like associated. For example we have a careers page that lists job postings, each with a link to an application for the job that contains the id of the job posting to the application form so that when the application is created the job posting is associated with the record.

| Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
