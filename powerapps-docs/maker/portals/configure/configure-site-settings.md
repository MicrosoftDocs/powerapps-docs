# Configure site settings for portals

A site setting is a configurable, named value that is used by website code to modify the behavior or visual style of the portal. Typically when a developer creates the website code, they will reference site settings for various components to enable an end user to modify the setting values to alter the website without having to change the code, recompile, and redeploy the website.

The sample portals that are provided with the installation of Power Apps portals contain several configurable site settings for various styles used to modify many visual elements within the site such as background style, text color, and layout width.
You can manage the following types of site settings:

- **Global Portal settings**: These settings apply to all portals associated with the Common Data Service environment in which they are being added.
- **Portal site settings**: These settings apply to specific portals (website records) that are associated with the Common Data Service environment in which they are being added.


## Manage portal site settings

1. Go to [portal settings](../manage-existing-portals.md#settings) and select **Site settings**.

2. To create a new setting, select **New**.

3. To edit an existing setting, select the **Site Setting** listed in the grid.

4. Specify values for the fields provided: 

    - **Name**:  A label referenced by website code to retrieve the appropriate setting. The name should be unique for the associated website, because the code retrieving the setting will take the first record found with the matching name.
    
    - **Website**:  The associated website. 
    
    - **Value**: The setting
    
    - **Description**: The purpose of the setting or special instructions.

5. Select **Save & Close**.
