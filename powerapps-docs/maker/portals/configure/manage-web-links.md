# Manage web links

A web link can link to any URL or it can link to another webpage within the same website. When a web link is to a webpage, the security and publishing state of the webpage will apply to the web link as well. Web links are always part of a web link set. A web link set is a group of links such as a primary navigation or a group of footer links. Web link sets allow internal, regardless of placement in the site map, and external links to be grouped together and ordered.

## Manage web links in Power Apps portals

Once the portal customizations have been imported into the Common Data Service environment, web links can be managed from a web link set.

1. Open the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md).

2. Go to **Portals** > **Web Link Sets**.

3. To create a new web link set, select **New**.

4. To edit an existing web link set, select the web link set name.

5. Enter appropriate values in the fields.

6. If you create a new web link set, select **Save** to save the record so you can add web links.

7. Go to the **Links** tab.

8. To create a new web link, select **New Web Link**.

    ![Add web link](../media/add-web-link.png "add web link")

9. Enter appropriate values in the fields.

## Web link set attributes and relationships

The table below explains many of the standard Web Link Set properties used by portals. It is important to note that the way in which many of the content/display-oriented properties are rendered is controlled by the page template used.
