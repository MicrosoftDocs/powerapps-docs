# Configure the Google provider

As explained in the [OAuth 2.0 providers in portals](configure-oauth2-provider.md) article, Google is one of the several identity providers using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. To get started with configuring Google as the identity provider, select **Configure** from [provider settings](use-simplified-authentication-configuration.md#add-configure-or-delete-an-identity-provider) page.

## Step 1 - Create Google app

To use **Google** as an identity provider, you need to [create an app in Google](https://console.developers.google.com/) with a redirect URL.

> [!NOTE]
> The Reply URL is used by the Google app to redirect users to the portal after the authentication succeeds. If your portal uses a custom domain name, you might have a different URL than the one provided here.​

To create an app in Google:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Google+ API](https://developers.google.com/people/legacy) is deprecated. We strongly recommend that you migrate to [Google People API](https://developers.google.com/people).

1. Open [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).  
1. Create an API project or open an existing project.
1. Select **Enable APIs and Services** from dashboard of APIs and Services.
1. Search and enable API **Google People API**.
1. Inside **Google APIs**, select **Credentials** on left navigation.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have consent screen configured already with portals top level domain, you can skip steps 6 through 14 and directly move to step 15. However, go through step 11 before moving to step 15 if your consent screen is configured but portals top level domain is not added.

1. Select **Configure consent screen**.
1. Select **External** user type.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Enter **Application name** and upload an image for logo if necessary.
1. Select appropriate **Support email**.
1. Enter `powerappsportals.com` as the top-level domain in **Authorized domains**. 
    > [!TIP]
    > Use `microsoftcrmportals.com` if you have not [updated your Power Apps portal domain name](../admin/update-portal-domain.md). You can also enter a [custom domain name](../admin/add-custom-domain.md) if you have configured.
1. Provide links for home page, privacy policy, and terms of service as required. 
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Credentials** from left navigation menu.
1. Select **OAuth client ID** from the **Create credentials** drop-down menu.
1. Select application type as **Web application**.
1. Enter **Name** for the OAuth Client ID.
1. Enter your Power Apps portal URL in **Authorized JavaScript Origins** list.
1. Enter **Authorized redirect URIs** as the Power Apps portal URL followed by `/signin-google`. For example, if portal URL is `https://contoso.powerappsportals.com`, authorized redirect URIs field should be `https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/signin-google`.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Copy **Client ID** and **Client secret** from **OAuth client** dialog box.

## Step 2 - Configure site settings

After you've created the app in Google, configure the site settings for the provider:

- **Client ID** - A unique app ID generated by Google for your app.​
- **Client Secret** -   The client secret generated by Google for your app.

## (Optional) Step 3 - Additional settings

To configure **Additional settings** for Google provider, see [configure additional settings for OAuth 2 providers](configure-oauth2-settings.md).
