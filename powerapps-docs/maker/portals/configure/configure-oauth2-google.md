# Configure the Google provider

![Configure the Google app](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-google.png "Configure the Google app")

To use **Google** as an identity provider, you need to [create an app in Google](https://console.developers.google.com/) with a redirect URL.

The redirect URL is used by the Google app to redirect users to the portal after the authentication succeeds. If your portal uses a custom domain name, you might have a different URL than the one provided here.​

**Portal site settings** for Google:

- **Client ID** - A unique app ID generated by Google for your app.​
- **Client Secret** -   The client secret generated by Google for your app.

To configure additional settings for Google, see [configure additional settings for OAuth 2 providers](#configure-additional-settings-for-oauth-2-providers).

For more information about configuring OAuth 2 providers, see [OAuth 2 provider settings for portals](configure-oauth2-settings.md).

## Google People API settings

> [!NOTE]
> [Google+ API](https://developers.google.com/people/legacy) is deprecated. We strongly recommend that you migrate to [Google People API](https://developers.google.com/people).

Following these steps to configure your Power Apps portal with [Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication] for user authentication.

1. Open [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).  
1. Create an API project or open an existing project.
1. Select **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** from dashboard of APIs and Services.
1. Search and enable API **Google People API**.
1. Inside **Google APIs**, select **Credentials** on left navigation.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have consent screen configured already with portals top level domain, you can skip steps 6 through 14 and directly move to step 15. However, go through step 11 before moving to step 15 if your consent screen is configured but portals top level domain is not added.

1. Select **CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN**.
1. Select **External** user type.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Type **Application name** and upload an image for logo if required.
1. Select appropriate **Support email**.
1. Type **powerappsportals.com** as the top level domain in **Authorized domains**. Use **microsoftcrmportals.com** if you have not [updated your Power Apps portal domain name](../admin/update-portal-domain.md). You can also type a [custom domain name](../admin/add-custom-domain.md) if you have configured. 
1. Provide links for home page, privacy policy and terms of service as required. 
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Credentials** from left navigation menu.
1. Select **OAuth client ID** from the **Create credentials** drop down menu.
1. Select application type as **Web application**.
1. Type **Name** for the OAuth Client ID.
1. Type your Power Apps portal URL in **Authorized JavaScript Origins** list.
1. Type **Authorized redirect URIs** as the Power Apps portal URL followed by **/signin-google**. For example, if portal URL is https://contoso.powerappsportals.com, authorized redirect URIs field should be https://contoso.powerappsportals.com/signin-google.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Copy **client ID** and **client secret** from **OAuth client** dialog box and configure [OAuth2 site settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/configure-oauth2-settings#create-site-settings-by-using-oauth2) in Power Apps portals.
