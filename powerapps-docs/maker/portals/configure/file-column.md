# Configure a file column on portals (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

The file column is used for storing binary data. The primary intended use of this column is to store a single file, note, or attachment; however, storage of other forms of binary data is also possible. Portals maker can configure file column on Basic and Advanced form to provide upload, view, modify and delete the file. The file column provides storing file up to the specified maximum size in Microsoft Dataverse table column.

## Enable File control on form

You must configure site settings **Control/EnableFilePreview** and set its value to **true** to enable file controls on the form. You don't require to make any configuration to use file column with Liquid code or Web API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This site setting is required during the preview period.
> - You cannot upload a file using **Insert** mode on a basic form or advanced form step.

## Liquid code

Liquid is an open-source template language that is integrated natively into Microsoft Power Apps portals. Developers can retrieve file column values while data is being queried by using fetchXML and entity view

```
{% for item in tables.results.entities %}
    {{ item.columnname.Name }}
    {{ item.columnname.Size }}
    {{ item.columnname.Url }}
{% endfor %}
```
| Attribute | Description | 
|-----|-----|
| Name | Name of the file associated with column |
| Size | File size in bytes |
| URL  | File download URL |

Example: Retrieve file column data from contact table

Create a new file data type column in [Microsoft Dataverse](../../data-platform/create-edit-field-portal.md#create-a-column) for contact table with name 'myfileattribute'.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you've configured the appropriate table permission on the contact table to read record

```
{% fetchxml contacts %}
<fetch version="1.0" output-format="xml-platform" mapping="logical" distinct="false">
  <entity name="contact">
    <attribute name="fullname" />
    <attribute name="myfileattribute" />    
  </entity>
</fetch>
{% endfetchxml %}

{% for item in contacts.results.entities %}
        "Full Name":"{{ item.fullname }}"
        "Entity File Url":"{{ item.myfileattribute.Name }}",      
        "Entity File Size":"{{ item.myfileattribute.Size }}",
        "Entity File Type":"{{ item.myfileattribute.Url }}" 
{% endfor %}
```

## Web API

Portals Web API can be used to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on file columns across Microsoft Dataverse tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you've configured the appropriate Web API [site settings](../web-api-overview.md#site-settings-for-the-web-api) for the tables and file columns tables you want to access.

### Retrieving file data

To retrieve file data, use the following APIs

```
GET /_api/<entity-type>(id)/<file-attribute-name>/$value
```

File data transfers from the web service endpoints are limited to a maximum of 16-MB data in a single service call. File data that exceeds 16 MB must be divided into 4 MB or smaller data blocks (chunks) where each block is received in a separate API call until all file data has been received. It is your responsibility to join the downloaded data blocks to form the complete data file by combining the data blocks in the same sequence as the blocks were received.

#### Example: File download \< 16 MB

##### Request

```
HTTP
GET [Portal Url]/_api/accounts(62d53214-9dfa-eb11-94ee-0022482230a8)/myfileattribute/$value
Headers:
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
```
##### Response

```
204 No Content
Body:
Byte[ ]
```

#### Example: File download \> 16 MB

##### Request

```
HTTP
GET [Portal Url]/_api/accounts(62d53214-9dfa-eb11-94ee-0022482230a8)/myfileattribute/$value
Headers:
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

##### Response

```
HTTP
204 No Content
Body:
Byte[ ]
```

### Upload file data

To upload the file, set the value of the file column to a byte array that contains the content of the file

```
PUT or PATCH /_api/<entity-type>(id)/<file-attribute-name>
```

#### Example: file upload

##### Request

```
HTTP
PUT [Portal Url]/_api/accounts(62d53214-9dfa-eb11-94ee-0022482230a8)/myfileattribute
Headers:
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Body :
Byte [ ]
```
