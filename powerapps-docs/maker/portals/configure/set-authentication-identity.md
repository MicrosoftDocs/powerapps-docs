# Local authentication, registration and other settings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - We recommend that you use [Azure AD B2C](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider.md) identity provider for authentication, and deprecate local identity provider for your portal. To learn about migrating to Azure AD B2C identity provider, go to [Migrate identity providers to Azure AD B2C](migrate-identity-providers.md).
> - Configuring local authentication requires using the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md) to configure the required site settings manually.

Portals provides authentication functionality built on the [ASP.NET Identity](https://www.asp.net/identity) API. ASP.NET Identity is in turn built on the [OWIN](https://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana) framework, which is also an important component of the authentication system. The services provided include:

- Local (username/password) user sign-in
- External (social provider) user sign-in through third-party identity providers
- Two-factor authentication with email
- Email address confirmation
- Password recovery
- Invitation code sign-up for registering pregenerated contact records

> [!NOTE]
> The **Mobile Phone Confirmed** field on the Portal Contact form of the Contact entity currently serves no purpose. This field must be used only when upgrading from Adxstudio Portals.

## Requirements

Portals requires:

- Portals Base
- [!INCLUDE[cc-microsoft](../../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Identity
- [!INCLUDE[cc-microsoft](../../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] Identity Workflows solution packages

## Authentication overview

Returning portal visitors can authenticate by using local user credentials or external identity provider accounts. A new visitor can register for a new user account either by providing a username and password or by signing in through an external provider. Visitors receiving invitation code from the portal administrator can redeem the code while signing up for a new user account.

**Related site settings:**

- `Authentication/Registration/Enabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/LocalLoginEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/ExternalLoginEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/OpenRegistrationEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/InvitationEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/RememberMeEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/ResetPasswordEnabled`

### Sign in by using a local identity or external identity

### Sign up by using a local identity or external identity

![Register for a new local account](../media/register-new-local-account.png "Register for a new local account")  

### Redeem an invitation code manually

![Sign up by using an invitation code](../media/sign-up-invitation-code.png "Sign up by using an invitation code")  

## Forgot password or password reset 

Returning visitors who require a password reset (and have previously specified an email address on their user profile) can request a password reset token to be sent to their email account. A reset token allows its owner to choose a new password. The token can also be abandoned, leaving the userâ€™s original password unmodified.

**Related site settings:**

- `Authentication/Registration/ResetPasswordEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/ResetPasswordRequiresConfirmedEmail`

**Related process:** Send a password reset to a contact

1.  Customize the email in the workflow as necessary.
2.  Submit the email to invoke the process.
3.  The visitor is prompted to check email.
4.  The visitor receives the password reset email with instructions.
5.  The visitor returns to the reset form.
6.  The password reset is complete.

## Redeem an invitation

Redeeming an invitation code allows a registering visitor to be associated with an existing contact record that was prepared in advance specifically for that visitor. Typically, the invitation codes are sent out by email, but you can use a general code submission form to send codes though other channels. After a valid invitation code is submitted, the normal user registration (sign-up) process takes place to set up the new user account.

**Related site settings:**

`Authentication/Registration/InvitationEnabled`

**Related process:** Send invitation

The email sent by this workflow must be customized by using the URL to the redeem invitation page on the portal: https://portal.contoso.com/register/?returnurl=%2f&invitation={Invitation Code(Invitation)}

1. Create an invitation for a new contact.

    ![Create an invitation for a new contact](../media/create-invitation.png "Create an invitation for a new contact")  

2. Customize and save the new invitation.

    ![Customize a new invitation](../media/customize-new-invitation.png "Customize a new invitation")  

3. Process: Send invitation
4. Customize the invitation email.
5. The invitation email opens the redemption page.
6. The user signs up by using the submitted invitation code.

    ![Sign up with an invitation code](../media/sign-up-invitation-code.png "Sign up by using an invitation code")  

### Disabled registration

If registration is disabled for a user after the user has redeemed an invitation, display a message by using the following content snippet:

**Name**: Account/Register/RegistrationDisabledMessage

**Value**: Registration has been disabled.

## Manage user accounts through profile pages

Authenticated users manage their user accounts through the **Security** navigation bar of the profile page. Users aren't limited to the single local account or single external account they chose at user registration time. Users who have an external account can choose to create a local account by applying a username and password. Users who started with a local account can choose to associate multiple external identities to their account. The profile page is also where the user is reminded to confirm their email address by requesting a confirmation email to be sent to their email account.

**Related site settings:**

- `Authentication/Registration/LocalLoginEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/ExternalLoginEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/TwoFactorEnabled`

## Set or change a password

A user who has an existing local account can apply a new password by providing the original password. A user who doesn't have a local account can choose a username and password to set up a new local account. The username can't be changed after it's set.

**Related site settings:**

`Authentication/Registration/LocalLoginEnabled`

**Related process:**
- Create a username and password.
- Change an existing password.

## Confirm an email address

Changing an email address (or setting it for the first time) puts it into an unconfirmed state. The user can request a confirmation email to be sent to their new email address, and the email will include instructions to the user for completing the email confirmation process.

**Related process:** Send an email confirmation to a contact

1. Customize the email in the workflow as necessary. 
2. The user submits a new email, which is in an unconfirmed state.
3. The user checks email for confirmation.
4. Process: Send email confirmation to contact
5. Customize the confirmation email.
6. The user selects the confirmation link to complete the confirmation process.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the primary email is specified for the contact because the confirmation email is sent only to the primary email (emailaddress1) of the contact. The confirmation email is not sent to the secondary email (emailaddress2) or alternate email (emailaddress3) of the contact record.

## Enable two-factor authentication

The two-factor authentication feature increases user account security by requiring proof of ownership of a confirmed email in addition to the standard local or external account sign-in. A user trying to sign in to an account that has two-factor authentication enabled is sent a security code to the confirmed email associated with their account. The security code must be submitted to complete the sign-in process. A user can choose to remember the browser that successfully passed the verification, so that the security code won't be required for next sign-ins from the same browser. Each user account enables this feature individually and requires a confirmed email.

> [!WARNING]
> If you create and enable the **Authentication/Registration/MobilePhoneEnabled** site setting to enable the legacy functionality, an error will occur. This site setting is not provided out of the box and not supported by portals.

**Related site settings:**

- `Authentication/Registration/TwoFactorEnabled`
- `Authentication/Registration/RememberBrowserEnabled`

**Related Process:** Send email two-factor code to a contact

1. Enable two-factor authentication.
2. Choose to receive the security code by email.
3. Wait for the email that contains the security code.
4. Process: Send Email Two Factor Code To Contact.
5. Two-factor authentication can be disabled.

## Manage external accounts

An authenticated user may connect (register) multiple external identities to their user account, one from each configured identity provider. After the identities are connected, the user may choose to sign in by using any of the connected identities. Existing identities can also be disconnected, as long as a single external, or local identity remains.

**Related Site Settings:**

- `Authentication/Registration/ExternalLoginEnabled`

**External Identity Provider Site Settings**

1.  Select a provider to connect to your user account.

    ![Manage external accounts](../media/manage-external-accounts.png "Manage external accounts")  

2.  Sign in by using the provider you want to connect.

The provider is now connected. The provider can also be disconnected.

|    Authentication/Registration/LoginButtonAuthenticationType    | If a portal only requires a single external identity provider (to handle all authentication), this allows the **Sign-In** button of the header nav bar to link directly to the sign-in page of that external identity provider (instead linking to the intermediate local sign-in form and identity provider selection page). Only a single identity provider can be selected for this action. Specify the *AuthenticationType* value of the provider.<br>For a single sign-on configuration using OpenIdConnect, such as using Azure Active Directory B2C, the user needs to provide the Authority.<br>For OAuth2 based providers the accepted values are: `Facebook, Google, Yahoo, [!INCLUDE[cc-microsoft](../../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)], LinkedIn, Yammer,` or `Twitter`<br>For WS-Federation-based providers, use the value specified for the `Authentication/WsFederation/ADFS/AuthenticationType` and `Authentication/WsFederation/[!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)]/\[provider\]/AuthenticationType` site settings.

||

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that the primary email is specified for the user because registration is done by using the primary email (emailaddress1) of the user. The user can't be registered by using the secondary email (emailaddress2) or alternate email (emailaddress3) of the contact record.

## User credential validation

The following describes the settings for adjusting username and password validation parameters. Validation occurs when users sign up for a new local account or change a password.

| Site Setting Name                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

For more information: [Password policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh994562(v=ws.10).aspx).                                                                                                           |  
| Authentication/UserManager/UserValidator/AllowOnlyAlphanumericUserNames | Whether to allow only alphanumeric characters for the username. <br> Default: `false` |  
| Authentication/UserManager/UserValidator/RequireUniqueEmail             | Whether a unique email address is needed for validating the user. <br> Default: `true` |  
| Authentication/UserManager/PasswordValidator/RequiredLength             | The minimum required password length. <br> Default: `8`. |  
| Authentication/UserManager/PasswordValidator/RequireNonLetterOrDigit    | Whether the password requires a non-letter or digit character. <br> Default: `false` |  
| Authentication/UserManager/PasswordValidator/RequireDigit               | Whether the password requires a numeric digit (from 0 through 9). <br> Default: `false` |  
| Authentication/UserManager/PasswordValidator/RequireLowercase           | Whether the password requires a lowercase letter (from a through z). <br> Default: `false` |  
| Authentication/UserManager/PasswordValidator/RequireUppercase           | Whether the password requires an uppercase letter (from A through Z). <br>  Default: `false` |

## User account lockout settings

The following describes the settings that define how and when an account becomes locked from authentication. When a certain number of failed password attempts are detected in a short while, the user account is locked for a while. The use can try again after the lockout period elapses.

| Site Setting Name                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
