# Simplified authentication and identity provider configuration (Preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Setting up authentication is a core customization in any portal. Simplified identity provider configuration in Power Apps portals provides in-app guidance for identity provider setup and abstracts setup complexities. Makers and administrators can easily configure the portal for supported identity providers.

> [!NOTE]
> The simplified authentication and identity provider configuration feature is in preview. To access this preview feature, you must use [Power Apps preview](https://make.preview.powerapps.com). After this preview feature is generally available, you'll be able to access it from [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). You can't turn this preview feature on or off for your portal. For more information about preview features, see [Understand experimental and preview features in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-experimental-preview). 

## Overview

You can enable, disable, and configure portal identity providers from [Power Apps preview](https://make.preview.powerapps.com) by using simplified portal authentication configuration. After you select an identity provider, you can then follow prompts to easily enter the provider settings, instead of [setting up authentication manually](set-authentication-identity.md).

### Authentication Settings

To begin configuring an identity provider for your portal:

1. Go to [Power Apps preview](https://make.preview.powerapps.com).

1. Select **Apps** from the left navigation pane.

    ![Select Apps](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-apps.png "Select Apps")

1. Select your portal from the list of available apps.

1. Select **Settings** from the top menu. You can also select **More Commands** (**...**), and then select **Settings**.

    ![Select Settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-settings.png "Select Settings")

1. From the settings on the right side of your workspace, select **Authentication Settings**.

    ![Authentication Settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/portal-settings-right-pane.png "Authentication Settings")

You'll see a list of identity providers that you can configure.

![Identity providers](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/portal-authentication-settings.png "Identity providers")

> [!NOTE]
> Power Apps portals supports several identity providers. However, the simplified authentication and identity provider configuration feature currently only supports the identity providers listed above.

#### Authentication settings from the portal details page

You can also view the identity providers from the portal details page.

1. Select your portal from the list of available apps.

1. Select **Details** from top menu. You can also select **More Commands** (**...**) and then select **Details**.

    ![Select details](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/select-details.png "Select details")

The details page displays the **Identity providers** section.

![Portal details](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/portal-details.png "Portal details")

> [!NOTE]
> Selecting **See all** from the portal details page takes you to the complete list of identity providers.

## General authentication settings

You can configure the following general authentication settings by selecting **Authentication Settings** on the **Identity providers** page.

![General authentication settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/general-authentication-settings.png "General authentication settings")

- **External login** - When set to **Off**, disables and hides external account registration and sign in.
<br>External authentication is provided by the ASP.NET Identity API. In this case, account credentials and password management are handled by a third-party identity providers such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft. Users sign up for access to the portal by selecting an external identity to register with the portal. After it's registered, an external identity has access to the same features as a local account. See [Manage external accounts](set-authentication-identity.md#manage-external-accounts) for related site settings.

- **[Open registration](configure-portal-authentication.md#open-registration)** - When set to **Off**, disables and hides external account registration.

You can also go to general authentication settings from the portal details page by selecting **Settings** in the upper-right corner of the **Identity providers** section.

![General authentication settings from the details page](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/general-settings-from-details.png "General authentication settings from the details page")

### Default identity provider

You can set any identity provider as the default. When an identity provider is set as the default, users signing in to the portal aren't redirected to the portal sign-in page; instead, the sign-in experience always defaults to signing in by using the selected provider.

![Default identity provider](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/set-default.png "Default identity provider")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you set an identity provider as the default, users won't have the option to choose any other identity provider.

After you set an identity provider as the default, you can select **Remove as default** to remove it as the default. If you remove an identity provider from being the default, users will be redirected to the portal sign-in page and can choose from the identity providers you've enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only set a configured identity provider as the default. The **Set as default** option becomes available after you configure an identity provider.

## Add, configure, or delete an identity provider

Several identity providers are added by default that you can configure. You can add additional Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C providers, or configure the available OAuth 2.0 providers such as LinkedIn and Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> - You can't change the configuration of the [Local sign in](configure-portal-authentication.md) and Azure Active Directory providers when using this interface.
> - You can have only one instance of each identity provider type for OAuth 2.0, such as **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, **Google**, **Twitter**, and **Microsoft**.
> - Updates to identity provider configuration might take a few minutes to be reflected on the portal. To apply your changes immediately, you can [restart the portal](../admin/admin-overview.md#open-power-apps-portals-admin-center).

### Add or configure a provider

To add an identity provider, select **Add provider** from **Authentication Settings**.

![Add a provider from settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/add-provider-from-settings.png "Add a provider from settings")

You can also select **Add provider** from the portal details page.

![Add a provider from the details page](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/add-provider-from-details.png "Add a provider from the details page")

You can select from the available list of providers, enter a name, and then select **Next** to configure the provider settings.

![Add a new provider](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/add-provider.png "Add a new provider")

> [!NOTE]
> The **Provider name** you enter here is displayed on the sign-in page for users as the text on the button they use when selecting this provider.

To configure a provider, select **Click to Configure** (or select **More Commands** (**...**), and then select **Configure**).

![Configure a provider](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-provider.png "Configure a provider")

> [!NOTE]
> You can use **Add provider** or **Configure** to add or configure a provider for the first time. After you configure a provider, you can edit it. You can also select the provider name hyperlink to open the configuration options quickly.

The configuration steps after you select **Next** depend on the type of identity provider you select. For example, the Azure Active Directory B2C configuration is different from how you set up LinkedIn. See the provider-specific sections later in this article to configure the provider of your choice.

### Edit a provider

After you add and configure a provider, you can see the provider in the **Enabled** state on portal settings or details pages.

To edit a provider you've configured, select it, select **More Commands** (**...**), and then select **Edit configuration**.

![Edit a provider](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/edit-provider.png "Edit a provider")

Refer to the provider-specific sections later in this article to edit settings for the provider type you selected.

### Delete a provider

To delete an identity provider, select **More Commands** (**...**), and then select **Delete**.

![Delete a provider](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/delete-provider.png "Delete a provider")

Deleting a provider deletes your provider configuration for the selected provider type, and the provider becomes available again for configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> When you delete a provider, only the portal configuration for the provider is deleted. For example, if you delete the LinkedIn provider, your LinkedIn app and app configuration remain intact. Similarly, if you delete an Azure Active Directory B2C provider, only the portal configuration is deleted; the Azure tenant configuration for this provider won't change.

## Configure the Azure Active Directory B2C provider

### Step 1 - Configure the Azure Active Directory B2C application

![Configure the Azure AD B2C app](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step1.png "Configure the Azure AD B2C app")

To use Azure AD B2C as an identity provider:

1. [Create and configure an Azure AD B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant).

1. [Register an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=applications#register-a-web-application) in your tenant. Use the **Reply URL** provided in the wizard while configuring the application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must choose **Yes** for the **Allow implicit flow** field and enter your portal URL in the **Reply URL** field.

1. [Create a user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-sign-up-and-sign-in-user-flow). Optionally, [create a password reset user flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows#create-a-password-reset-user-flow).

1. [Configure token compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/configure-tokens#configure-token-compatibility) with an **Issuer (iss) claim** URL that includes **tfp**. More information: [Token compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview#compatibility)

### Step 2 - Configure site settings

Configure the following site settings and password reset policy for your Azure AD B2C provider.

![Configure site settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step2.png "Configure site settings")

- **Authority** - The issuer URL defined in the metadata of the sign-up and sign-in policy user flow.​
<br> To get the issuer URL:

   1. Open the sign-up and sign-in user flow you created in [step 1](#step-1---configure-the-azure-active-directory-b2c-application). For this step, you need to go to the Azure AD B2C tenant on [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   1. Select **Run user flow**, and in the **Open** dialog box, select the URL at the top to open the configuration document. <br> The URL refers to the *OpenID Connect identity provider configuration document*, also known as the *OpenID well-known configuration endpoint*.
   1. Copy the URL of the **Issuer** from the configuration document that opens in a new browser.  

- **Client ID​** - Enter the **Application ID** of the Azure AD B2C application created in [step 1](#step-1---configure-the-azure-active-directory-b2c-application).

- **Redirect URI** - Enter the portal URL. <br> You only need to change the redirect URI if you use a custom domain name.

#### Password reset settings

- **Default policy ID** - Enter the name of the sign-up and sign-in user flow you created in [step 1](#step-1---configure-the-azure-active-directory-b2c-application). The name is prefixed with *B2C_1*.

- **Password reset policy ID** - Enter the name of the password reset user flow you created in [step 1](#step-1---configure-the-azure-active-directory-b2c-application). The name is prefixed with *B2C_1*.

- **Valid issuers** - A comma-delimited list of issuer URLs for the sign-up and sign-in user flow and password reset user flow you created in [step 1](#step-1---configure-the-azure-active-directory-b2c-application). 
<br> To get the issuer URLs for the sign-up and sign-in user flow, and password reset user flow, open each flow and then follow the steps under **Authority**, earlier in this section.

For more information about site settings, see [related site settings](azure-ad-b2c.md#related-site-settings).

### Step 3 - Configure additional settings

You have the option of configuring additional setting for the Azure AD B2C identity provider.

![Configure additional settings](media/use-simplified-authentication-configuration/configure-ad-b2c-step3.png "Configure additional settings")

- **Registration claims mapping​** - List of logical name/claim pairs to be used to map claim values returned from Azure AD B2C created during sign up to attributes in the contact record. <br> 
For example, if you've enabled **Job Title (jobTitle)** and **Postal Code (postalCode)** as **User Attributes** in your user flow and you want to update the corresponding Contact entity fields **Job Title (jobtitle)** and **Address 1: ZIP / Postal Code (address1_postalcode)**, enter the claims mapping as: ```jobtitle=jobTitle,address1_postalcode=postalCode```.
- **Login claims mapping** - List of logical name/claim pairs to be used to map claim values returned from Azure AD B2C after sign in to the attributes in the contact record. <br> 
For example, if you've enabled **Job Title (jobTitle)** and **Postal Code (postalCode)** as **Application Claims** in your user flow and you want to update the corresponding Contact entity fields **Job Title (jobtitle)** and **Address 1: ZIP / Postal Code (address1_postalcode)**, enter the claims mapping as: ```jobtitle=jobTitle,address1_postalcode=postalCode```.
- **External logout** - Enables or disables federated sign-out. When set to **On**, users are redirected to the federated sign-out user experience when they sign out from the portal. When set to **Off**, users are only signed out from the portal.
- **Contact mapping with email** - Specifies whether contacts are mapped to a corresponding email. When set to **On**, this setting associates a unique contact record with a matching email address, and then automatically assigns the external identity provider to the contact after the user successfully signs in.
- **Registration Enabled**​ - Turn [open registration](configure-portal-authentication.md#open-registration) for your portal on or off. Setting this toggle to **Off** disables and hides external account registration.

Select **Confirm** to view a summary of your configuration and complete the identity configuration.
