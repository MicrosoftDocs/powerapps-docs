# Define multistep  form steps for portals


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

The multistep form Step provides the flow logic of the form's user experience such as steps and conditional branching. It also provided details about the rendering of a form and additional behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> multistep forms persists the history of the steps a user has visited in an object on an multistep form Session table. If an multistep form's steps have been modified, previously created history data could now be stale. Anytime steps are changed, it is recommended that you delete all multistep form Session records to eliminate miss match between sequence of steps logged in history and the current sequence.

Each multistep form will be presented on the portal has one or more steps. These steps share some common properties, outlined below. Each Step contains a pointer (a lookup) to the next step, except for terminal steps. Terminal steps don't have a next time, and are thus the last step of the multistep form (because of conditional branching, there can be multiple terminal steps).

| Next Step                 | The step that will follow the current step. This option will be blank for single-step single form.                                                                                                            |

## Considerations for multistep  form steps

multistep form steps can't be reused. If you try to use multistep  form step again, you'll see the following message:

"The step \<multistep  form step name\> has already been used earlier in this form. Update the multistep form to use each step only once, and try again."

When that happens, ensure you use don't reuse multistep  form steps in a multistep form.

The following conditions are exempt from the limitation of multistep  form step reuse:

- When using "Next step if Condition fails" option in step type "Condition".
- When using different&mdash;Yes/No&mdash;branches.
