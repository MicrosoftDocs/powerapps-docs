# Configure a contact for use on a portal

After filling out the basic information for a contact (or having a user fill out the sign-up form in a portal), go to the web authentication tab on the portal contact form to configure a contact by using local authentication. For more information about federated authentication options, see [Set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md). 

> [!NOTE] 
> You can also configure a contact in Power Pages. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction)

To configure a contact for portals by using local authentication, follow these instructions:  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - We recommend that you use the [Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)](configure-azure-ad-b2c-provider.md) identity provider for authentication and deprecate the local identity provider for your portal. More information: [Migrate identity providers to Azure AD B2C](migrate-identity-providers.md)

Complete the change password workflow, and the necessary fields will be automatically configured. When you've done this, your contact will be configured for your portals.

1. In the **Security** section, select **Contacts**.

1. Create a new contact or select an existing contact.

1. Choose the **Contact - Portal Contact** form.

1. Select the **Web Authentication** tab.

1. Enter a **Username**.

1. Select **Save**.

1. On the command bar, choose **Change Password**.

1. Complete the [change password steps](#change-password-for-a-contact-from-the-portal-management-app), and the necessary fields will be automatically configured. The contact will then be configured to access the portal.

A portal user can also [register directly](set-authentication-identity.md#sign-up-by-using-a-local-identity-or-external-identity) on the portal, or be sent an [invitation](invite-contacts.md) to register. 

For more information about federated authentication options, see [set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md). 

## Change password for a contact from the Portal Management app

In order to perform the following steps, you will need to be assigned either the **System Administrator**, or **System Customizer** [security roles](/power-platform/admin/database-security). 

Alternatively, you can create a [field security profile](/power-platform/admin/field-level-security) with the following permissions for the **contact** table:

| Schema name | Display name | Table | Privileges |
| - | - | - | - |
| adx_identity_logonenabled | Login Enabled | contact | Read, Update, Create |
| adx_identity_passwordhash | Password Hash | contact | Read, Update, Create |
| adx_identity_username | User Name | contact | Read, Update, Create |
| sharepointemailaddress | SharePoint Email Address | user | Update, Create |

Add the user or team that will need to perform these steps to the field security profile.

1. Open the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md).

1. Go to **Portals** > **Contacts**, and open the contact for which you want to change the password.
    Alternately, you can also open the **Contacts** page from the [Share](../manage-existing-portals.md#share) pane. 

1. Select **Change Password** from the command bar the contact form.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-contacts/change-password.png" alt-text="Change password from the command bar.":::

1. In the **New password** field, enter a new password, and then select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-contacts/change-password-new-password.png" alt-text="Enter new password for the contact.":::

    If you don't enter a password and select **Next**, you'll be asked whether you want to remove password for the selected contact.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-contacts/change-password-remove-password.png" alt-text="Remove password for the contact.":::

1. After making the changes, select **Done**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/configure-contacts/change-password-done.png" alt-text="Password changed for the contact.":::

### Deprecation of business process flow

Earlier versions of the change password process utilized a task flow which has been deprecated. In Dataverse security roles, the **Change Password for Portals Contact** privilege under the **Business Process Flows** tab no longer requires any options selected.
