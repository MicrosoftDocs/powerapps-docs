# Configure a contact for use on a portal

After filling out the basic information for a contact, (or having a user fill out the sign-up form in a portal), go to the web authentication tab on the portal contact form to configure a contact by using local authentication. For more information about federated authentication options, see [Set authentication identity for a portal](set-authentication-identity.md). To configure a contact for portals by using local authentication, follow these instructions:  

1.  Enter a **username**.
2.  On the command ribbon, go to **More Commands** &gt; **Change Password**.

Complete the change password workflow, and the necessary fields will be automatically configured. When you have done this, your contact will be configured for your portals.

## Change password for a contact from Portal Management app

1.  Open the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md).

2.  Go to **Portals** > **Contacts**, and open the contact for which you want to change the password.
    Alternately, you can also open the **Contacts** page from the [Share](../manage-existing-portals.md#share) pane. 

3.	Select **Task Flow** on the toolbar at the top.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Task flow icon](../media/task-flow.png "Task flow icon")

4.	Select the **Change password for portal contact** task flow.

5.	In the **Change password for portal contact** pane, select or create a contact to change the password, and then select **Next**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select a contact to change the password](../media/change-password-select-contact.png "Select a contact to change the password")

6.	In the **New password** field, enter a new password, and then select **Next**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Enter new password for the contact](../media/change-password-new-password.png "Enter new password for the contact")

    If you do not enter a password and select **Next**, you'll be asked whether you want to remove password for the selected contact.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Remove password for the contact](../media/change-password-remove-password.png "Remove password for the contact")

7.	After making the changes, select **Done**.
