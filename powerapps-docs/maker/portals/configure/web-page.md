# Manage web pages

A web page represents a particular URL in a portals website, and is one of the core entities of the portals content management system. Through parent and child relationships to other web pages, this entity forms the hierarchy of a website (i.e., its site map).

Web pages also form the basis for including other, specialized entity types in the portal site map – web files, shortcuts, forums, web forms, and blogs are all situated in the portal site map through – and thus derive their URLs from – a relationship to a parent web page.

## Manage web pages

Web pages can be created, edited, and deleted from the Power Apps portals Studio. However, advanced customization can be performed from the Portal Management app.  

1. Open the [Portal Management app](configure-portal.md).

2. Go to **Portals** > **Web Pages**.

3. To edit an existing web page, select the web page name.

4. Enter appropriate values in the fields.

5. Select **Save & Close**.

### Web page attributes

The table below explains many of the standard web page attributes used by portals. It is important to note that the way in which many of the content/display-oriented attributes are rendered is controlled by the page template used, and thus by the portal developer.

|     Partial URL     | The URL path segment used to build the portal URL of this page. <br>The single root (Home) page of your website – the single page that has no associated Parent Page – must have a Partial URL value of /.<br>Partial URL values are used as URL path segments. As such, they should not contain illegal URL path characters, such as ?, #, !, %. Since portals URLs are generated by joining together Partial URL values with slashes (/), they should also not generally contain slashes. Recommended practice would be to restrict Partial URL values to letters, numbers, and hyphens or underscores. For example: press-releases, Users_Guide, product1. |

The most common use of this feature is to provide published/draft control over content.<br>Users with content management permissions may be granted the ability to use Preview Mode, which allows these users to see (preview) unpublished content.                                                                                                                                                  |

It has no functional implications, but can be useful for things like, for example, manually specifying a published date on a press release or news item page.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If the current date/time is prior to this date, this page will not be visible. (The exception to this is that users with content management permissions may be granted the ability to use Preview Mode, which allows these users to see (preview) unreleased content.) This is useful for controlling the release of time-sensitive content, like news or press releases.                                                                                                              |

If the current date/time is after this date, this page will not be visible. (The exception to this is that users with content management permissions may be granted the ability to use Preview Mode, which allows these users to see (preview) expired content.)                                                                                                                                                                 |

If this field is provided, this value will be used on the portal, instead of the Name field. This is useful in the case that you want a different title to appear on the portal, while having the Name be useful for content authors and users.                                                                                                                                                                   |

This value is generally used for administrative purposes, but this information could be rendered on a portal, if the page's Page Template supports it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This controls the ordering of pages and other site map entities when, for example, a list of links to the child entities of a given page are rendered on the portal.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

This is used by the WebLinkNavigationPage.aspx Page Template to render a list of navigation links on the left hand side of the page. Create a Page Template in CRM and specify the Rewrite Url property as ~/Pages/WebLinkNavigationPage.aspx. Set the Web Page's Page Template to this template record. This is typically done to the parent page only and all child pages will automatically receive the same list of links of its parent. The current page will have its corresponding link highlighted.                                                                        |
