# Configure a choices column on portals

Makers can design [basic forms](entity-forms.md) and [advanced forms](web-form-properties.md) to include [choices columns](../../data-platform/types-of-fields.md#choices) defined in Microsoft Dataverse. This feature provides the ability for portal users to select multiple options while submitting data, and display views that include choices columns through [lists](entity-lists.md).

## Basic forms and advanced forms

You can design a [basic form](entity-forms.md) or an [advanced form](web-form-properties.md) step in the portal website by using a Dataverse form that has a choices column to support the selection of multiple options. Portal users can insert, modify, or clear the selection.

The selected activities appear at the top of the window. The user enters the letters C a m in the box, and then selects the option Camping when it appears. At the top of the window in the list of activities, the user selects the Close button next to one of the options to deselect it.

## List

You can define a choices column in a Dataverse view to display the multiple options that are available for the record in a list. The choices column supports quick search by typing a keyword to filter the list.

> [!NOTE]
> Sorting a [list](entity-lists.md) by the choices column isn't supported.

## Liquid

Developers can design the website by using Liquid to retrieve the records from a Dataverse table. Choices columns can be retrieved while the data is being queried by using fetchXML or an entity view.

```html
{% for choice in record.ChoicesColumn %}
    {{ choice.Label }}
    {{ choice.Value }}
{% endfor %} 
```

Examples of choices for *sample\_outdooractivities* values are shown in the following table.

| **Value** | **Label**         |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | Swimming          |
| 2         | Hiking            |
| 3         | Mountain Climbing |
| 4         | Fishing           |
| 5         | Hunting           |
| 6         | Running           |
| 7         | Boating           |
| 8         | Skiing            |
| 9         | Camping           |

Examples of contact table values are shown in the following table.

| **'fullname' column** | **'Sample\_outdooractivities' column** |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Quinn Yarborough      | 1,9                                    |
| Avery Orton           | 2                                      |
| Yuri Maple            | 4                                      |
| Ravi Mundy            | 2,3,8,9                                |

### Retrieve selected options by using fetchXML

```html
{% fetchxml contacts %}
    <fetch version="1.0" output-format="xml-platform" mapping="logical" distinct="false">
        <entity name="contact">
            <attribute name="firstname" >
            <attribute name="lastname" >
            <attribute name="sample_outdooractivities" >
        </entity>
    </fetch>
{% endfetchxml %}
{% for item in contacts.results.entities %}
{
    "First Name":"{{ item.firstname }}",
    "Last Name":"{{ item.lastname }}",
    "Outdoor Activities": [
        {% for choice in item.sample_outdooractivities %}
            {{choice.Label}},
        {% endfor %}
    ]
}
{% endfor %}
```

### Retrieve selected options by using an entity view

```html
{% entitylist id:page.adx_entitylist.id %}
{% for e in entityview.records -%}
    {
    "First Name":"{{ e.firstname }}",
    "Last Name":"{{ e.lastname }}",
    "Outdoor Activities": [
    {% for choice in e. sample_outdooractivities %}
        {{choice.Label}},
    {% endfor %}
    ]
    }
{% endfor -%}
```

## Web API 

Developers can use choices columns by using the [Web API](../web-api-overview.md) read, create, and update operations.

<u>Read</u>

`GET \[Portal URI]\_api/contacts?$select=fullname,sample\_outdooractivities &$top=1`

Response –

```html
{
"value": [
    {
    "@odata.etag": "W/\\"1066412\\"",
    "fullname":" Quinn Yarborough ",
    "sample\_outdooractivities ":"1,9",
    "sample\_outdooractivities @OData.Community.Display.V1.FormattedValue":"Swimming, Camping"
    }
    ]
}
```

<u>Create / Edit</u>

Method – PATCH / PUT

`\[Portal URI]\_api/contacts (guid)`

Body –

```html
{
"sample\_outdooractivities": "1,4,8",
}
```

## Known issues

Choices control will not be available in [basic and advanced form metadata](configure-basic-form-metadata.md) to apply extra behavior modification logic or override the functionality of form fields.
