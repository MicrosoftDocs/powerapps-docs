# Edit CSS for themes in Power Apps portal

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allows you to control the formatting of your website. By default, bootstrap.min.css and theme.css files are available. You can edit the existing CSS files and upload new CSS files. When you upload a new CSS file, it will be available as a web file in the Portal Management app.

> [!NOTE]
> Power Apps portals are based on Bootstrap 3.3.x with the exception of [Event portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/marketing/developer/event-management-web-application). Portal developers should not replace Bootstrap 3 with other CSS libraries as some of the scenarios in Power Apps portals are dependent on Bootstrap 3.3.x.
