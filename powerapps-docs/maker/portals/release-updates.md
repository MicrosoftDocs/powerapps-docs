When a request to the portal is generated from any user, their IP address is evaluated against the allow list. If the IP address is not on the list, the portal displays a web page with an HTTP 403 status code. More information: [Restrict portal access by IP address](admin/ip-address-restrict.md)

- **Manage SharePoint documents**: Dynamics 365 Portals now supports uploading and displaying documents to and from SharePoint directly on an entity form or web form in a portal. This allows portal users to view, download, add, and delete documents from a portal. Portal users can also create folders to organize their documents. More information: [Manage SharePoint documents](manage-sharepoint-documents.md)

Once your portal is live, you can configure the portal to send all application errors to an Azure Blob storage account owned by you. This will help you to debug the issues reported by your customers. More information: [Access portal error logs](admin/view-portal-error-log.md)
- **Renew portal authentication key**: A portal connects to Common Data Service environment using Azure active directory application. To do this, it requires an authentication key connected to Azure Active Directory application. This key is added when you provision your portal and it must be renewed every two years. This version of portal brings in the capability for administrators to be notified about key expiration and renew this key from Power Apps Portals admin center. More information: [Renew portal authentication key](admin/manage-auth-key.md)
- **Implement General Data Protection Regulation in portals**: As a portal administrator, you can now configure your portal to meet the GDPR standards.

You can also setup checks such as, if a portal is accessed by a minor user, the user must have parental consent to access the portal. Implementing GDPR allows obtaining consent from portal users regarding use of their personal data, identifying minor users, and obtaining parental consent for minor users. More information: [Implement GDPR in portals](configure/implement-gdpr.md)

### Dynamics 365 Portals version 8.3 for the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365

Dynamics 365 Portals version 8.3 for the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 has many new updates and features:

- **Ability to include attachments with knowledge articles**: You can display note attachments along with knowledge articles.

More information: Display attachments with knowledge articles

  > [!Note]
  > Search for attachments can only be performed on the note's description and file attachment name. The content of the attached file is not searchable.
  
- **Administrative wizard to add an entity to the portal**: This feature introduces a new administrative wizard to easily expose data on the portal. The entity created through the wizard takes the data from your organization and makes a subset of it available to your portal customers, based on the security and permission model you choose.

- **Import metadata translation**: Use this feature to import the metadata translation of newly activated languages after you install a portal. More information: [Import metadata translation](admin/import-metadata-translation.md)

- **Source code availability for portals**: A one-time release of Dynamics 365 Portals code is released to the Microsoft Download Center under MIT license for developers to download. This feature enables portals to be deployed to Dynamics 365 on-premises or online environments, and allows developers to customize the code to suit their specific business needs.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Source code is offered as a working sample and on an as-needed basis. No direct support will be provided for any modifications to the code.

- **Single sign-on (SSO) configuration improvements and support for Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)**: For portals that require a consumer-based sign-in, this feature now supports the ability to:
  - Configure your portal authentication to use SSO. 
  - Support Azure AD B2C for customer authentication.
  - Manage your portal security in Azure.

  More information: [Azure AD B2C provider settings for portals](configure/azure-ad-b2c.md)

- **Support time zone&ndash;independent date formats in portals forms**: This feature adds support for **Date Only** and **Timezone Independent** behaviors for date/time fields. More information: [Behavior and format of the date and time field](configure/behavior-format-date-time-field.md)

- **Allowing non-global administrators to provision a portal**: You can now provision a portal if you are assigned to the System Administrator role of the CRM organization selected for the portal. You can now also manage an existing portal, if you have any of the following roles:
  - Dynamics 365 Service Administrator
  - System Administrator of the CRM organization selected for the portal

- **Store the custom domain name for a portal**: This feature stores the primary domain name of a portal on the website record. If the domain name is changed in the future, the latest primary domain name will be stored.

- **Tracking cookie for portals**: A persistent cookie, Dynamics365PortalAnalytics, will be set whenever a user  goes to a portal. This cookie has an expiration of 90 days. This cookie does not store any of the user's personal data and is used by Microsoft to collect analytics about portal service. Please read the Microsoft online services privacy statement [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=856855).

- **Performance improvement of header and footer on a portal**: Two new site settings, Header/OutputCache/Enabled and Footer/OutputCache/Enabled, are added to enable header/footer output caching when these settings are set to true. For new users, these site settings are set to true by default, thereby enabling header and footer output caching. For existing users who upgrade to a newer version of Dynamics 365 Portals, output caching is disabled by default. It means that the Header and Footer web templates are parsed and rendered on every page load. To enable output caching, they must update the appropriate web templates and create the required site settings. More information: [Enable header and footer output caching](configure/enable-header-footer-output-caching.md)

### December 2016 updates

- **Product filtering:** Portal users can trim access to knowledge articles related to their product ownership to avoid information overload.
- **Content access levels:** A new level of ownership associated with a portal contact, account, or web role can be used to control access to knowledge articles, to help target the right article at the right audience and prevent irrelevant articles from surfacing. More information: [Content access levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/portals/manage-knowledge-articles-content-levels)
- **Knowledge article reporting enhancement:** The portal tracks where a knowledge article was used in the portal.
