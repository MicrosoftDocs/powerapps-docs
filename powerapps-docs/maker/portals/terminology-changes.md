# Terminology changes in Power Apps portals

Effective November 2020, Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. More information: [Common Data Service is now Microsoft Dataverse](https://aka.ms/PAuAppBlog). Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has also been updated. For example, *entity* is now *table* and *field* is now *column*. More information: [Terminology updates in Dataverse](../data-platform/data-platform-intro.md).

Based on the terminology changes, customer feedback, and data from user research, effective March 2021, we've updated some terminology in Power Apps portals to be more intuitive and make its usage more productive. The terminology updates are listed below, and we're in the process of rolling them out across Microsoft Power Platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We're in the process of rolling out the terminology changes for Power Apps portals interface, Power Apps portals Studio, Portal Management app, and [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). During this process, your environment may show legacy or current terminology depending on the rollout stage. Power Apps portals documentation will be updated soon to reflect the latest terminology.

## Key terminology changes for portals

The following table lists key terminology changes in portals.

| Legacy term | Current term |
| - | - |
| Entity form | Basic form |
| Web form | Advanced form |
| Entity list | List |
| Entity permission | Table permission |
| Entity Name | Table Name |

All references to the key terminology changes are going to be updated in the Power Apps portals interface, Portal Management app, portals Studio, and [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). 

Terminology updates apply to references of legacy terms and any feature area or location where that term exists. For example, *list* is the updated terminology for the legacy term of *entity list*. Therefore, in the user interface, what was previously *enable search on entity list* will now be updated to *enable search on list*.
