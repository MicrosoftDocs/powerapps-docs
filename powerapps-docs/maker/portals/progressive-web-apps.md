# Overview of Progressive Web Apps (preview)

You can convert your functional portal as a progressive web app with native app like look & feel using the portal Studio.​

Portals can use Progressive Web App (PWA) technology to provide multi-platform support to create an app that will work on all platforms (android/iOS/windows/chromebooks) and form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet).

Progressive Web Apps are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app-like experience. PWA brings a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores (Android/Windows/Chrome store). This capability enables external and internal customers to use portals as an app. You can also pin the app directly to your home screen on your mobile device.

> [!Note]
> The iOS app store is not supported.

PWAs can be used for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in a portal for read-only offline availability.

The following graphics illustrate the user experience when adding the portal on a home screen using the browser that installs the portal as a PWA.

Users can also install the portal from the store if you choose to create an app package and publish the app to the device store.
