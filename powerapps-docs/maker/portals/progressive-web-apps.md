# Overview of portals as progressive web apps


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

You can enable your functional portal as a progressive web app (PWA), with native app–like look and feel, by using Power Apps portals Studio.

With this feature, Power Apps portals now supports using progressive web app technology to provide multiplatform support to create an app that will work on all platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, and Chromebooks) and form factors (mobile, desktop, and tablet).

PWAs are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app–like experience. PWAs bring a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores. This capability enables external and internal customers to use a portal as an app. They can also pin the app directly to the home screen on their mobile device.

PWAs can be used for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in your portal to be available offline (the content on these pages will be read-only).

The following graphics illustrate the users' experience of adding a portal to their home screen by using the browser that installs the portal as a PWA.

Users can also install the portal from their device's app store, if you created an app package and published the app to the app store for their device.

> [!Note]
> Publishing your PWA to the iOS app store is currently not supported.
