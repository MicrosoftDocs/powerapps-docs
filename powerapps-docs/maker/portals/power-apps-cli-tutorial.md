# Tutorial: Use Microsoft Power Platform CLI with portals

In this tutorial example, you’ll see how to get started with Microsoft Power Platform CLI to update sample portals configuration.

> [!NOTE] 
> - You can also use Power Platform CLI with Power Pages. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction)
> - This tutorial focuses on the required Microsoft Power Platform CLI commands for
Power Apps portals use. For more information about commands used in Power Platform
CLI, read [Common
commands](/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction#common-commands).

## Download and install Visual Studio Code

To connect to Power Apps portals, and to use Microsoft Power Platform CLI commands, use
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) and the [integrated
terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal). The
integrated terminal makes it easy to connect to the Dataverse environment and to
download, change, and upload the portals configuration. You can also use Windows
PowerShell instead.

## Step 1. Authenticate

Before you connect, list, download, or upload any changes for a Power Apps
portal, you must authenticate to the Dataverse environment first. For more
information about authentication using Microsoft Power Platform CLI, go to [Microsoft Power Platform CLI –
Auth](../../developer/data-platform/cli/reference/auth-command.md).

To authenticate, open Windows PowerShell and run the following command using
your Dataverse environment URL:

`pac auth create -u [Dataverse URL]`

**Example**

`pac auth create -u https://contoso-org.crm.dynamics.com`

Follow the prompts of authentication to sign in to the environment.

![Example of how to authenticate to a Dataverse environment using Microsoft Power Platform CLI.](media/power-apps-cli/auth-create.png "Example of how to authenticate to a Dataverse environment using Microsoft Power Platform CLI")

## Step 2. List available portals

Use the **list** command to list the available Power Apps portals in the
Dataverse environment you connected to in the previous step.

`pac paportal list`

![Example list of portals.](media/power-apps-cli/paportal-list.png "Example list of portals")

## Step 3. Download portals content

Download portal website content from the connected Dataverse environment.

`pac paportal download --path [PATH] -id [WebSiteId-GUID]`

**Example**

`pac paportal download --path c:\pac-portals\downloads -id
d44574f9-acc3-4ccc-8d8d-85cf5b7ad141`

For the **id** parameter, use the **WebSiteId** returned from the output of the
previous step.

![Example of downloading portals content.](media/power-apps-cli/paportal-download.png "Example of downloading portals content")

## Step 4. Change portals content

Change the configuration using Visual Studio Code and save your changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you update only the supported tables for use with Power Platform 
CLI. For more information, see [Supported tables](power-apps-cli.md#supported-tables).

For example, the default portal page shows text such as this:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli/sample-section.png" alt-text="Sample portals page text":::

This text is visible from the webpage html:

![Visual Studio Code with text highlighted for change.](media/power-apps-cli/vs-code-page.png "Visual Studio Code with text highlighted for change")

You can alter this text and save the changes:

![Updated text using Visual Studio Code.](media/power-apps-cli/page-updated.png "Updated text using Visual Studio Code")

> [!TIP]
> You can change the location of the folder path in PowerShell/integrated
terminal to the downloaded location, and enter “*code .”* to open the folder
directly in Visual Studio Code.

## Step 5. Upload the changes

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're uploading to multiple environments, see [upload the changes using deployment profile](#upload-the-changes-using-deployment-profile) to learn how to upload changes using deployment profile.
> - Ensure that the target environment's maximum attachment size is set to the same or greater size as your source environment.
> - The maximum size of files is determined by the **Maximum file size** setting in the [system settings email tab](/power-platform/admin/system-settings-dialog-box-email-tab) in the environment system settings dialog box.

After making the required changes, upload them using the following command:

`pac paportal upload --path [Folder-location]`

**Example**

`pac paportal upload --path C:\pac-portals\downloads\custom-portal\`

![Starting upload.](media/power-apps-cli/upload.png "Starting upload")

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure the path for the portals content you entered is correct. By
default, a folder named by the portal (friendly name) is created with downloaded
portals content. For example, if the portal’s friendly name is *custom-portal,*
the path for the above command (--path) should be
*C:\\pac-portals\\downloads\\custom-portal*.

The upload only happens for content that's been changed. In this example, since the
change is made to a webpage, content is uploaded only for the adx_webpage
table.

### Upload the changes using deployment profile

When working with multiple different environments, you may consider using deployment profiles to ensure the changes are uploaded to the correct environment using deployment profile.

1. Create a folder named **deployment-profiles** inside the folder containing the portal content. For example, if the downloaded portal content is inside "starter-portal", deployment profiles folder should be inside this folder.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli-tutorial/deployment-profiles-folder.png" alt-text="Folder for deployment profiles":::

1. Inside deployment profiles folder, create a deployment YAML file that contains the environment-specific changes. For example, development environment can be called "dev.deployment.yml".

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli-tutorial/deployment-dev-file.png" alt-text="Deployment profile YAML for dev":::

1. Edit the deployment YAML file using Visual Studio Code with the following format:

    ```yml
    <table-name>:
    - <record-id>: <GUID>
      <column-name>: <Name>
      <column-value>: <Value>
    ```

    For example, the following sample YAML code updates the value for "Browser Title Suffix" from default "Custom Portal" to "Custom Portal (Dev)".

    ```yml
    adx_contentsnippet:
        - adx_contentsnippetid: 76227a41-a33c-4d63-b0f6-cd4ecd116bf8 # Replace with your content snippet ID
          adx_name: Browser Title Suffix # Setting name
          adx_value:  &nbsp;· Custom Portal (Dev) # Setting value
    ```

1. To upload the changes to a different environment using a deployment profile YAML file, [authenticate](#step-1-authenticate) to the target org first.

1. After authenticated and connected to the correct environment, use the following command to upload the content:

    `pac paportal upload --path "C:\portals\starter-portal" --deploymentProfile dev`

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the above example, the deployment profile name used is "dev" after following the previous steps to create a dev deployment profile. Change the name from "dev" to any other (such as QA for "qa.deployment.yml", or Test for "test.deployment.yml") if you've used a different filename for your deployment YAML file.

## Step 6. Confirm the changes

To confirm the changes made to the portal webpage:

1. Clear the [server-side cache](admin/clear-server-side-cache.md), or use [Sync Configuration](portal-designer-anatomy.md) by using Power Apps portals Studio.

1. Browse to the portal webpage to see the change.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli/changed-section.png" alt-text="View updated page content.":::

1. If you've used deployment profile example [explained previously](#upload-the-changes-using-deployment-profile), the YAML snippet will update the value as shown below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli-tutorial/browser-title-suffix.png" alt-text="Browser title suffix from Portal Management app":::

    The browser title suffix updated through the above change shows the change when you open the portal in a browser:

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-cli-tutorial/browser-change.png" alt-text="Browser change ":::

This concludes the tutorial. You can repeat the above steps and change the
portals content for other [supported tables](power-apps-cli.md#supported-tables).
