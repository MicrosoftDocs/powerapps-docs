# Overview of themes in Power Apps portals

In Power Apps portals, the **Enable basic theme** feature is set to **Off**. When you turn on this feature, you can use default themes called **Presets**. You can also create copies of the preset themes for additional customization.

In this article, you'll walk through the basic themes feature. For advanced theme customization, see [Edit CSS](edit-css.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The basic theme feature is in preview. For more information about preview features, see [Understand experimental and preview features in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-experimental-preview).

## Sass variables

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language with fully CSS-compatible syntax. When you enable the basic theme feature, you can use [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) instead of values to configure theme colors.

For example, if you want the **Header** color to be 25 percent lighter than the **Primary** color, you can use the following value instead of a specific color:

```
lighten($primaryColor, 25%);
```

![Sass example](./media/theme-overview/sass-example.png "Sass example")

You can use the following Sass variables with basic themes:

|Color option | Sass variable name |
| - | - |
| Primary | ```$primaryColor``` |
| Header | ```$headerColor``` |
| Header menu text | ```$headerMenuTextColor``` |
| Header menu hover | ```$headerMenuHoverColor``` |
| Body background |  ```$bodyBackground``` |
| Footer background | ```$footerColor​``` |
| Footer text | ```$footerTextColor``` |

### Sass variable order

Sass variables work from top to bottom. You can set the *Header* color to ```lighten($primaryColor, 25%);```. But, you can't set the *Primary* color to ```lighten($headerColor, 25%);``` because *Header* is below *Primary* in the list of color options.

## Basic theme considerations

- You can't have two themes with the same theme name or the same theme file name. 
- Any color value you enter manually must be for a valid color.
- Changing the CSS for preset themes isn't supported.
- The recommended theme foreground and background color contrast ratio is 4.5:1, for accessibility.
