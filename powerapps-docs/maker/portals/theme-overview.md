## Saas variables

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is a stylesheet language with fully CSS-compatible syntax. When you enable *Basic theme* feature, you can use [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) instead of values to configure theme colors.

For example, if you want the **Header** color to be 25% lighter than the **Primary** color, you can use the following value instead of actual color:

```
lighten($primaryColor, 25%);
```

![Sass example](./media/theme-overview/sass-example.png)

You can use the following Sass variables with *Basic theme*:

|Color option | Sass variable name
| - | -
| Primary | ```$primaryColor```
| Header | ```$headerColor```
| Header menu text | ```$headerMenuTextColor```
| Header menu hover | ```$headerMenuHoverColor```
| Body background |  ```$bodyBackground```
| Footer background | ```$footerColor​```
| Footer text | ```$footerTextColor```

### Sass variable order

Sass variables work from top to bottom. You can set *Header* color to ```lighten($primaryColor, 25%);```. But, you can't set *Primary* color to ```lighten($headerColor, 25%);``` as *Header* is below *Primary* in color options.

## Basic theme considerations

- You can't have two themes with same *theme name* or same *theme file name*. 
- Color value manually entered must be for a valid color.
- Changing CSS for preset themes isn't supported.
- Theme foreground and background color contrast ratio is recommended at 4.5:1 for accessibility.
