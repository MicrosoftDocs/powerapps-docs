# Create forum posts on the portal


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

A forum post is a user-submitted message enclosed into a block containing the user's details and the date and time it was submitted. Members are usually allowed to edit or delete their own posts. Posts are contained in [forum threads](manage-forum-threads.md), where they appear as boxes one after another. The first post starts the thread; this may be called the OP (original post). Posts that follow in the thread are meant to continue discussion about that post, or respond to other replies; it is not uncommon for discussions to be derailed.  

## Create forum posts

The forum post editor will appear automatically when a user has successfully signed in to the portal and navigated to a forum thread page, provided the developer has implemented the functionality in the forum thread's page template.

1. Sign in to the portal.

2. Navigate to a [forum thread](manage-forum-threads.md).  

3. Compose your reply in the rich text editor.

4. Select **Post this reply**.
