## Enable ratings for a knowledge article

## Expand and collapse sections

You can add sections that can be expanded and collapsed by adding a **collapsible section** using the *collapsible command button*:

You can see the following example with one section expanded and the rest in collapsed positions:

Following considerations apply when using collapsible sections:

- Default state of a collapsible section is collapsed.
- Existing web page and web templates can work with collapsible sections without any additional changes.
- If you select **Print**, the state of the sections from current selections persist for print preview.
- The collapsible sections, when added to your articles, have additional JS function and CSS style for the expand/collapse button.

### Customize expand and collapse behavior

You can customize the default CSS and JS files and create additional customization. The default CSS file name is `collapsible.css` and JavaScript file name is `collapsible.js`.

The following example shows a [web template](../liquid/store-content-web-templates.md) using default JavaScript and CSS files. Update the file name and location for the web template to your customized JavaScript and CSS files:
