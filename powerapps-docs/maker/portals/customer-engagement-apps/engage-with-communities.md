# Engage with communities by using the community portal

Keep your customer engagement strong by growing a community, publishing articles, gathering user feedback, and acting on user-provided ideas. With out-of-the-box solutions available with portals you can:

- Allow your users to hold conversations by posting messages on a forum. A forum can contain a number of topics, also known as threads, and can be replied to by many users.

- Manage multiple corporate or community blogs on a single portal, with multiple authors per blog. [!INCLUDE[proc-more-information](../../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage blogs](manage-blogs.md)
