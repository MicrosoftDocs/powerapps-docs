# Manage forum threads

A forum thread (sometimes called a topic) is a collection of posts, usually displayed from oldest to newest. A thread can contain any number of posts, including multiple posts from the same members, even if they were added to the thread one after the other. A thread is contained in a [forum](setup-manage-forums.md) and may have an associated date that is taken as the date of the last post. The content or purpose of the thread is identified by the first post, also known as the original post (OP). When a member posts in a thread, the thread jumps to the top because it is the latest updated thread. Similarly, other threads will jump to the top when they receive posts. Sometimes, a member posts in a thread for no reason but to “bump” that thread (cause it to be displayed as the top thread).. Threads that are important but rarely receive posts are made “sticky” (or, as it is sometimes called, pinned). A sticky thread will always appear in front of normal threads, often in its own section. A thread's popularity is measured on forums in reply (total posts minus one, the opening post, in most default forum settings) counts. Some forums also track page views.  

## Manage forum threads in Dynamics 365 Portals

You can create, edit, and delete forum threads in Dynamics 365 Portals.

> [!Note]
> Although you can create forum threads in Dynamics 365 Portals, we recommend you do this from the portal content editor, where the process is less involved and ensures the thread is correctly associated with the original forum post.

### Create or edit forum threads

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 Portals.

2. Go to **Community** > **Forum Threads**.

3. To create a new thread, select **New**.

4. To edit an existing thread, select the name of the thread.

5. Enter appropriate values in the field.

    > [!Note]                                
    > You will need to create the original [forum posts](create-forum-posts.md) to be associated with this thread and assign the newly created forum post record to the **First Post** and **Last Post** lookup fields provided.  

6. Select **Save**.

## Create forum threads from the portal content editor

The forum thread editor will appear automatically when a user has successfully signed in to the portal and navigated to a forum page, provided the developer has implemented the functionality in the forum's page template.

1. Sign in to the portal.

2. Navigate to the forum page within the portal that you would like to post a new thread in.

2. In the **Thread Title** field, enter title of the thread.

3. From the **Thread Type** list, choose the appropriate type of the thread. 

4. Compose the content of the thread in the rich text editor.

5. Select **Create this thread**.
