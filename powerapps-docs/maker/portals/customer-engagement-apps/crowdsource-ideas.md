> [!NOTE]
> - The way in which many of the content/display-oriented attributes are rendered is controlled by the views created by the portal developer.
> - Restricting access to Idea forums by using web roles is not supported.

### Enable voting for status reasons

By default, an idea is enabled for voting only when the Status Reason is set to New. If you want to enable voting on an idea for different status reasons, you must create the `Ideas/EnableVotingForStatusReasons` site setting and set its value to the required status reason values.

For example, say you want to enable voting for New, Accepted, and Rejected status reasons. You must create the site setting and set its value as:

- **Name**: Ideas/EnableVotingForStatusReasons

- **Value**: 1;100000000;100000002

> [!NOTE]
> - If all the values in site setting are wrong, voting will be disabled regardless of the status reason.
> - If this site setting does not exist, the idea will be enabled for voting only when the Status Reason is set to New.

To get the status reason values:

1.	Sign in to Dynamics 365 Portals.

2.	Go to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Customize the System**.

3.	In the customization dialog, go to **Components** > **Entities** > **Idea** in the left navigation pane. 

4.	Expand the **Idea** table and select **Fields**.

5.	Select the **statuscode** field from the list and open it in field editor.

6.	Under the **Type** section, open the statuses to see their respective values.

### Enable autocomplete for ideas

While creating a new idea, there might be a scenario where a similar idea already exists. As an administrator, you can configure your portal to display a list of similar ideas when a portal user tries to create a new idea. This avoids creation of duplicate ideas. To enable a portal to display a list of similar ideas when a new idea is being created, you must create the `Ideas/EnableAutoComplete` site setting and set its value to **True**.
