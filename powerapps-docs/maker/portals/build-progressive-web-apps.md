1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. On the left pane, select **Apps**.

1. From the list of apps, select your portal.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/enable-pwa.png" alt-text="Enable PWA capability from portals Studio." :::

## Brand your app

You can create your own branded PWA by using the customization options to change the app name, starting page, color, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> On iOS devices, icons for the PWA will be shown as thumbnails and the customized splash screen won't be displayed.

1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Under **Customization**, select **Customize PWA**.

1. Update the following PWA settings for your portal.
    
    | **Setting** | **Description** |
    |-------------------------|-------------------------|
    | Title | The name of the portal PWA that will appear on the mobile device and in the app store. |
    | Description | The description of the portal PWA that will appear on the mobile device and in the app store. |
    | Starting page of the app | The start page for the portal when it's opened through the PWA. |
    | Splash screen background | The background color for the splash screen when the PWA is loaded. |
    | App icon | The icon for the app that will appear on the mobile device and in the app store.<br>**Note:** Supports .jpg, .jpeg, .png formats with a maximum upload size of 5 mb. Size of icon must be 512 &times; 512 pixels. |
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/customize-pwa.png" alt-text="Customizing PWA settings such as title, description, and color." :::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > After customizing the PWA, select **Browse website** to clear the cache. This will cause changes to be reflected instantly.

## Manage offline behavior

PWA offers support for a smooth navigation experience when the device being used is offline or disconnected from the internet. You can choose the pages within your portal that will be available offline (read-only), and a message page for the rest of the portal capabilities that haven't been enabled for offline access.

### Configure offline pages for the portal PWA

1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Select **Customize PWA**.

1. Under **Offline behavior**, select **Manage offline pages**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/offline-behavior.png" alt-text="Selecting pages for offline mode." :::

1. Select the pages that you want to enable users to access when they use the PWA offline.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/manage-offline.png" alt-text="Managing offline pages." :::

> [!NOTE]
> When configuring offline access for PWA pages, be sure to consider the storage limitations for user devices. When the storage requirement for offline PWA access exceeds the available storage on the device, the entire portal will be unavailable for offline access. We recommend that you test the user experience of offline access and only cache the pages that will be most helpful and important to your users. Remember that offline pages can only show information; pages that contain forms to fill out or run queries won't work while offline.

### Set up an offline message page

When a device is offline, the page you configure as the offline message page appears when users try to access pages that haven't been enabled for offline access.

1. In portals Studio, select **Progressive web app**.

1. Under **Customization**, select **Offline message page**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/offline-message.png" alt-text="Configuring the offline message page." :::

1. Customize the page as you would any other portals page.

1. Change the page template to suit your business needs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/edit-webpage.png" alt-text="Customizing the offline message page in portals Studio." border="false" :::

> [!NOTE]
> You can't change the **Title** or **Partial URL** ("*/default-offline-page*") fields for the offline page. A default offline page will be shown to users if the offline page is missing.

> [!TIP]
> After configuring the offline PWA experience, select **Browse website** to clear the cache. This will cause changes to be reflected instantly.

### Test your portal in offline mode

After you've [enabled offline pages](#manage-offline-behavior), you can now use a mobile device in offline mode and browse through different pages that have been enabled for offline access.

1. Browse to your portal by using a web browser on your mobile device in online mode.

1. Select **Add to Home screen** or a similar option. For example, on an Android device, the option might be **+ Add to** > **App screen**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/add-to-home.png" alt-text="Adding the PWA to the home page on a mobile device." border="false":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > This action downloads portal pages that have been enabled for offline browsing. This might take a while, depending on network bandwidth and the size of the pages that were selected for offline browsing.

1. Enable offline mode in your mobile device.

1. Open your portal from the home screen. You'll see a notification at the top reminding you that you're browsing in offline mode. If you select any pages that haven't been enabled for offline browsing, the offline message appears.

    :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/pwa-offline.png" alt-text="Read-only page in offline mode for a PWA app.":::   :::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/not-connected.png" alt-text="Not connected to the internet page in PWA app." :::

## Distribute your app

### Distribute your app by using a browser

After your portal is enabled as a PWA, your users can pin Power Apps portals as an app to the home screen on their device. This is supported on all platforms (Android, iOS, Chromebook, and Windows) in addition to all form factors (mobile, desktop, and tablet).

### Distribute your app through an app store

You can create an app package for your portal PWA and publish the package to different app stores such as Microsoft Store and Google Play.

To create an app package, go to portals Studio. Under **App package**, select **Create app package**.

:::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/open-pwa-builder.png" alt-text="Opening PWA Builder to create an app package in portals Studio." border="false":::

You'll be taken to [the PWA Builder website](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) where you can create an app package for various app stores. The package you create by using PWA Builder contains:

- An app package for the PWA to be used in its respective app store.

- A step-by-step document about publishing the app.

For more details, go to the [PWA resource hub](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/).

#### Additional considerations for Android

For the Android platform, you can also update the Android certificate with the **Update android certificate** option.

:::image type="content" source="media/progressive-web-apps/update-android.png" alt-text="Menu item in portals Studio to update the Android certificate." border="false":::

Update the title and the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint to update the digital asset links file (assetlinks.json) that proves ownership of your PWA.

## Advanced configuration

The PWA capability for portals uses the following configurations that you can update by using the Portal Management app.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use Power Apps portals Studio to work with PWA features instead of customizing them by using the Portal Management app.

| **Type** | **Name** | **Description** | **Value** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Site Setting | PWAFeature | Site setting to enable PWA for the portal | { "status": "enable" }<br /></br>{ "status": "disable" } |
| Web file | PWAManifestjson.en-US.json | The PWA manifest file is stored as this JSON web file. | This web file contains all customization-related properties of the PWA (such as app name and splash screen color). |
| Site marker | Default Offline Page | This site marker defines which page to show when the user is offline. By default, it points to the default offline page. | "Default Offline Page" |
