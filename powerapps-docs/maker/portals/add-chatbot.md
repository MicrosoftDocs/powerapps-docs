# Add chatbot to a page (Preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Power Apps portals allows you to add a [Power Virtual Agents chatbot](/power-virtual-agents/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents) to answer questions posted by a visitor on your portal page. A chatbot (bot) configured with different topics, and trigger phrases, can automatically respond to questions posted by a visitor in a chat conversation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Prerequisites

Before you add a Power Virtual Agents bot to a Power Apps portals page, you must create a bot first. If you don't have any available bots, you'll have the option in portals to go to Power Virtual Agents to create a bot. To learn about how to create a bot, go to [Create and delete Power Virtual Agents bots](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-first-bot).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature requires the following versions for starter portal package and portal host:
> - Portal host version [9.3.4.x](versions/version-9.3.4.x.md) or later.
> - Starter portal package version [9.2.2103.x](versions/package-version-9.2.2103.md) or later. More information: [additional considerations](#additional-considerations)

## Add chatbot component

To add a chatbot component to portal page:

1. Go to [Power Apps Preview](https://make.preview.powerapps.com).

1. Select **Apps** from the left pane.

1. Select your portal.

1. Select **Edit** to open the portals Studio.

1. Select **Components** from the left pane.

1. Select **Chatbot** component.

1. Select your bot.

    ![Select your bot](media/add-chatbot/select-your-bot.png "Select your bot")

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't have a bot already created, or want to create a new bot to use in portals, select **Power Virtual Agents**. After you create bot, select **Sync configuration** inside portals Studio to reflect the bot changes.

1. Select whether the bot appears on all pages in your portal, or the selected pages.

1. If you select **Specific pages**, use **Manage bots in pages** to control pages that can use this bot.

You can add more bots from your environment across different pages in a portal. For example, a bot that answers questions related to workplace such as "Back to work" can be added to HR page. Or, a bot that answers to basic queries for payroll, such as "Payroll questions" can be added to Finance page. However, you can't have one page use more than one bot.

## Advanced configuration

Chatbot component is rendered using a web template called **Power Virtual Agents**.

![Chatbot web template](media/add-chatbot/pva-web-template.png "Chatbot web template")

You can change the values for the following parameters inside the "window.PvaEmbeddedWebChat.renderWebChat()" function.

| Parameter | Value |
| - | - |
| width | Uses variable "chatWidth". To change width, update the width in pixel: <br> `let chatWidth = "320px";` |
| height | Uses variable "chatHeight". To change height, update the height in pixel: <br> `let chatHeight =  "480px";` |
| headerText | Title of the bot. By default, uses the bot's name. To change, add "headerText" parameter with the bot header value: <br> `"headerText": 'Contoso chatbot';` | 
| webChatHeaderStyleOptions | Determines header style for the chatbot component, such as the color of font, and background. To change, update "webChatHeaderStyleOptions" parameter with the values for "fontColor", and "backgroundColor" properties: <br> `"webChatHeaderStyleOptions": {"fontColor":'black',"backgroundColor":'white',}`

After changing the web template, ensure you select **Sync configuration** to update the configuration in open Studio session and reflect the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> Any changes to the Power Virtual Agents web template other than the parameters explained above are not supported.

"Portal upgrade required" <br>
"An upgrade is required to use this feature on your portal. If you upgrade the portal, ensure you Sync Configuration to refresh your current portals Studio session with new portals package."
