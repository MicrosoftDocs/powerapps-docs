# Use the content editor to edit page content

You can use the portal content editor to edit text, create links, and display images on webpage. To use the portal content editor, you need the appropriate permissions and the content to be modified must be in the page template.

To modify the content, point to the content to be modified, and then select the edit button that appears.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you use [Power Apps portals Studio](portal-designer-anatomy.md) to edit the portal.

## Content editor commands and controls

The editor toolbar has a number of buttons to help with content editing. Move the mouse cursor over a button to see a tool tip for the buttons function. The table below also has more detail about the available buttons, listed in the order they appear in the toolbar.

## Browse pages and files by using the file picker

The file picker provides a way to browse pages and files that belong to the same website. New files can be uploaded using the file picker as well. The file picker is available when adding a link or an image through the portal content editor. Select **Browse Server** to open the file picker. Browse to a page or file by using the left tree view and double-click the page or file in the rightmost list view to select it.

To upload new files:

1. Navigate to the folder to upload the file to and select the disk icon with a green plus on it.
2. In the dialog box that opens, select **Choose File** and pick a file to upload. Do the same in the next field to add more than one file.
3. Select **Ok** to upload the selected files.
