# Manage SharePoint documents


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

Microsoft Dataverse supports integration with [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online](../../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)] that enables you to use the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] from within Dataverse. Power Apps portals now supports uploading and displaying documents to and from [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] directly on a basic form or multistep form in a portal. This allows portal users to view, download, add, and delete documents from a portal. Portal users can also create subfolders to organize their documents.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can also manage SharePoint documents in Power Pages. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction)

> [!NOTE]
> - Document management works only with [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online](../../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)].
> - Document management is supported with server-based integration.

To work with the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] from within Dataverse, you must:

1.	[Enable document management functionality for your environment](#step-1-enable-document-management-functionality-in-model-driven-apps)

2.	[Set up SharePoint integration from Power Apps portals admin center](#step-2-set-up-sharepoint-integration-from-power-apps-portals-admin-center)

3.	[Enable document management for tables](#step-3-enable-document-management-for-tables)

4.	[Configure the appropriate form in Power Apps documents](#step-4-configure-the-appropriate-form-to-display-documents)

5.	[Create appropriate table permission and assign it to the appropriate web role](#step-5-create-appropriate-table-permission-and-assign-it-to-the-appropriate-web-role)

## Step 1: Enable document management functionality in model-driven apps

You must enable the document management functionality in model-driven apps by using server-based [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration allows model-driven apps and [!INCLUDE[pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online](../../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)] to perform a server-to-server connection. The default [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site record is used by the portal. For information on how to enable document management functionality in model-driven apps, see [Set up model-driven apps to use SharePoint Online](/power-platform/admin/set-up-dynamics-365-online-to-use-sharepoint-online).

## Step 2: Set up SharePoint integration from Power Apps portals admin center

To use the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], you must enable [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration from the Power Apps portals admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a global administrator to perform this action.

1. Open [Power Apps portals admin center](admin/admin-overview.md).

2.	Go to **Set up [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration** > **Enable [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enable SharePoint integration.](media/enable-sharepoint-integration.png "Enable SharePoint integration")

3.	Select **Enable** in the confirmation window. This will enable the portal to communicate with [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. While the [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is being enabled, the portal restarts and will be unavailable for a few minutes. A message appears when [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is enabled.

When [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is enabled, the following action becomes available:

- **Disable [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration**: Allows you to disable the [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration with your portal. While the [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is being disabled, the portal restarts and will be unavailable for a few minutes. A message appears when [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration is disabled.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Disable SharePoint integration.](media/disable-sharepoint-integration.png "Disable SharePoint integration")

Enabling or disabling the [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration will update the [!INCLUDE[pn-azure-active-directory](../../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] ([!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] AD) application for the portal and add or remove the required [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] permissions, respectively. You'll also be redirected to provide your consent for the changes to be made in the [!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] AD application. 

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Disable SharePoint integration consent screen.](media/sharepoint-integration-consent.png "Disable SharePoint integration consent screen")

If you don't provide your consent:

- Enabling or disabling the [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration won't be complete and an error message will display.

- Your out-of-the-box [!INCLUDE[pn-azure-shortest](../../includes/pn-azure-shortest.md)] AD login on the portal won't work.


## Step 3: Enable document management for tables
You must enable document management for tables to store documents related to table records in [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. For information on how to enable document management for tables, see [Enable SharePoint document management for specific tables](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-sharepoint-document-management-specific-entities).

## Step 4: Configure the appropriate form to display documents

### Power Apps customization

Identify the form where you want to use document management capabilities. You must edit the form by using model-driven app form editor and add a subgrid to it. The subgrid adds a section to the form, which allows you to work with documents from within a portal. You must set the following properties in the subgrid for this feature to work:

- Under **Data Source**, select **Document Locations** from the **Table** list.

- Under **Data Source**, select **Active Document Locations** from the **Default View** list.

You can specify name and label as per your requirement. Save and publish the form once the subgrid is added and configured.

> [!NOTE]
> Document management must be enabled for the table for which you edit the form. More information: [Enable document management for tables](#step-3-enable-document-management-for-tables)

### Power Apps portals configuration

Apart from the standard configuration required for basic form or multistep form, you must set the following properties to enable document management:

- **Table Name** and **Form Name**: Enter the table and form names customized in the previous step, respectively.

- Select the **Enable Table Permission** check box on the form to allow a user to read the documents.

- Set the **Mode** to **Edit** to allow document uploads.

> [!NOTE]
> Document uploading requires the parent table record to exist. If you set the Mode to Insert, the document upload will not work because the parent table record is not created until the form is submitted.

## Step 5: Create appropriate table permission and assign it to the appropriate web role

Two table permission records are required to establish the necessary access to view and upload documents.

- Permissions on the table of the table or multistep form: 
    - Create a **Table Permission** record specifying the **Table Name** as the table of the basic form or multistep form configured previously. 
    - Select a **Access Type** and access type relationship that is appropriate to the behavior of the form that you want.
    - Enable **Read** and **Append To** privileges to allow read access to documents and optionally enable **Write** privilege to allow document uploads. Ignore the **Child Table Permissions** section for now since it will be populated by the next step.
- Permissions on the **Document Location** with **Parent access type** referring to the previous permission record: 
    - Create a **Table Permission** record specifying the **Table Name** as **Document Location** table with **Access Type** set to **Parent**. 
    - Select the Parent Table Permission to the table permission record created in previous step. 
    - Privileges 
        - The minimum privileges to allow read access to documents are **Read**, **Create**, and **Append**. 
        - Include **Write** privileges for document upload access. 
        - Include **Delete** to allow deletion of a document.

> [!NOTE]
> A corresponding child table permission on the **Document Location** table needs to be created for each instance of the parent table permission record that exists on the table of the table or multistep form where documents need to be shown.

## Configure file upload size

By default, the file size is set to 10 MB. However, you can configure the file size to a maximum of 50 MB by using the site setting `SharePoint/MaxUploadSize`.

## Maximum file download size

We recommend limiting the size of the individual files available for download to 250 MB or less. If you use portals to download larger files from SharePoint, the operation may timeout after a couple of minutes.

## Sample configuration to enable document management on the Case basic form

The below example demonstrates configuration using the Case table which needs the Dynamics 365 Customer Service application as a pre-requisite. Although this sample uses the Case table, it is just an illustration of the steps mentioned above and can be followed with any other custom table or any Dataverse table that supports managing documents in SharePoint. 

1.	Follow the instructions in [Step 1](#step-1-enable-document-management-functionality-in-model-driven-apps) to ensure that server-based configuration is complete for your environment and [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration.

2.	Follow the instructions in [Step 2](#step-2-set-up-sharepoint-integration-from-power-apps-portals-admin-center) to ensure that the portal has permissions to integrate with [!INCLUDE[pn-sharepoint-short](../../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. 

3.	Follow the instructions in [Step 3](#step-3-enable-document-management-for-tables) to ensure Document Management is enabled for the Case table.

4.	Follow the instructions in [Step 4](#step-4-configure-the-appropriate-form-to-display-documents) with the following configurations:

    - Model-driven apps customization

        a. Go to **Settings** > **Customization** > **Customize the System**. 

        b. In the **Default Solution**, go to the **Case** table > **Forms**. 
    
        c. Open the **Web – Edit Case** in form editor.

         > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
         > ![Web - Edit Case form.](media/web-edit-case-form.png "Web - Edit Case form")
    
        d. Select the **Created On** field on the form, and on the **Insert** tab, select **Sub-Grid**.

         > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
         > ![Add a subgrid to the Web - Edit Case form.](media/add-sub-grid.png "Add a subgrid to the Web - Edit Case form")
    
        e. In the **Set Properties** dialog box, set the following properties, and select **OK**:

         - **Name** (This can be any name): CaseDocuments 
    
         - **Label** (This can be any label name): Case Documents 
      
         - **Table**: Document Locations 
    
         - **Default View**: Active Document Locations

         > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
         > ![Subgrid properties.](media/sub-grid-properties.png "Subgrid properties")

        f. In the form editor, select **Save** and then select **Publish**.

    - Power Apps portals configuration

        a. Open [Portal Management app](configure/configure-portal.md) -> **Basic Forms**.
    
        b. Find and open **Customer Service - Edit Case** basic form.
    
        c. Review and ensure the following properties are set:
    
         - **Table Name**: Case (incident)
    
         - **Form Name**: Web – Edit Case
    
         - **Mode**: Edit
    
         - **Table Permission**: Enabled
         
        d. If you’ve made any changes to the form, select **Save**.

5. Follow [Step 5](#step-5-create-appropriate-table-permission-and-assign-it-to-the-appropriate-web-role) to make sure table permissions are granted to the users.

   1. Go to the **Web Role** record that is associated to the user. For this sample, we’ll assume that the user has an Administrator web role.

   2. Ensure that a Table Permission record exists by the name of **Customer Service - Cases where contact is customer**. 

      > [!NOTE]
      > Ensure that your web role has this table permission added. If your user is already an Administrator, then the above table permission need not be explicitly assigned.

   3. Create a new table permission, enter the following details, and select **Save**:

    - **Name** (This can be any name): Customer Service - Related Documents

    - **Table Name**: Document Location
        
    - **Access Type**: Parent
        
    - **Parent Table Permission**: Customer Service - Cases where contact is customer
        
    - **Parent Relationship**: incident_SharePointDocumentLocations
        
    - **Privileges**: Read, Create, Append, Write, Delete

   4. Sign in to portal to ensure document management is enabled for the Case table.

      a. Go to the **Support** page.

      > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
      > ![Portal support page.](media/portal-support-page.png "Portal support page")

      b. Select an existing Case record from the list. Go to the **Case Documents** section on the page and see the document list added.

      > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
      > ![Case document.](media/case-document.png "Case document")
