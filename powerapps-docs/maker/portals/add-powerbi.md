# Add Power BI

You can add Power BI component on a page to display Power BI dashboards and reports on your portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you begin, read [Power BI access type considerations](#power-bi-access-type-considerations) and [general Power BI considerations](#general-power-bi-considerations) to get familiar with important Power BI terms and considerations for Power Apps portals.

To add a Power BI component to a web page:

1. [Edit the
    portal](../portals/manage-existing-portals.md#edit).

1. Select the page to add a component to.

1. Select an editable element on the canvas.

1. Select **Components** from the left side of the screen.

1. From Portal components section, select **Power BI**. The Power BI placeholder is added to the canvas:

1. In the properties pane on the right side of the screen, enter the following information:

    1. **Access type**: Select appropriate option from the drop-down as per your requirement.

        ![Power BI Access type](media/powerbi-access-type.png "Power BI Access type")

        1. **Embed for your customers** - Allows you to securely share the Power BI dashboards or reports to external users without Power BI license or Azure Active Directory authentication setup. This option uses Power BI Embedded services to integrate Power BI dashboards or reports into portal.
            > [!NOTE]
            > Ensure [Power BI Embedded service is enabled](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#enable-power-bi-embedded-service) and respective Power BI workspaces are selected, and shared with the maker or the logged-in user.

        1. **Embed for your organization** - Allows you to securely share the Power BI dashboards or reports to Azure Active Directory authenticated users.

            > [!NOTE]
            > Ensure you've shared Power BI workspaces with maker and target portal users.

        3. **Publish to web** - Allows you to share Power BI report or dashboard to anyone on the internet.

        For more information about access types, go to [access types](#power-bi-access-type-considerations).

    1. **Workspace**: Select the Power BI workspace from the list.

    1. **Select type**: Select type as *Dashboard* or *Report* from the list.

        ![Select type](media/type-powerbi.png "Select type")

        - **Dashboard** - Allows you to choose a **Dashboard**, and then a **Tile** from the selected dashboard to display on the web page.
        - **Report** - Allows you to select a **Report**, and then a **Page** from the report to display on the web page.

    1. **Apply roles**: If you have defined roles in Power BI and assigned them to reports, you must enter appropriate roles in this field.

        ![Apply roles](media/apply-roles-powerbi.png "Apply roles")
    
        - You can enter multiple roles separated by a comma (for example, `role_1,role_2`). For more information on defining roles in Power BI, go to [Row-level security (RLS) with Power BI](/power-bi/service-admin-rls). <br>
        - Only available for access type **Embed for your customer**.

    1. **Apply filter**: Allows user to load the report with pre-filtered values. User can provide filter condition in the field. 
        
        ![Apply filter](media/apply-filter-powerbi.png "Apply filter")

        - Filter parameter must be without `?filter=''` prefix. For example, `Table/Field eq 'value'`.
        <br> For more information, go to [filter parameter details](/power-bi/service-url-filters).
        - Only available for **Reports** with access types **Embed for your customer** and **Embed for your organization**.

    1. **Embed code URL**: Enter embed code URL.
    
        ![Embed Code URL](media/embed-code-url.png "Embed Code URL")

        - To learn about how to get embed code URL, go to [Publish to web from Power BI](/power-bi/service-publish-to-web)
        - Only available for access type **Publish to web**.

### Power BI access type considerations

The following list explains Power BI access types in brief and lists access type considerations for Power Apps portals. For more information about Power BI access types, go to [Difference between Power BI service and Power BI embedded](/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-faq#how-is-power-bi-embedded-different-from-power-bi-the-service).

- **Embed for your customers**:
    - Shows the list of workspaces shared to user currently logged in and enabled for [Power BI Embedded service](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#enable-power-bi-embedded-service).
    - Uses Power BI Embedded service.
    - If you've used Power BI Embedded service with Power Apps portals before, you'll see the following error when you select **Embed for your customers**:

        ![Power BI Embed for your customers - enable visualization again](media/embed-power-bi-visualization-enable-again.png)
    
        When this happens, ensure you [disable](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#disable-power-bi-visualization) and then [enable](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#enable-power-bi-visualization) Power BI visualization again.
    - If you add Power BI with **Embed for your customers** on a Power Apps portal page that is available **anonymously**, anyone can view the dashboard. To secure such a web page, read [web page access control in Power Apps portal](../portals/configure/webpage-access-control.md).

- **Embed for your organization**:

    - Shows the list of workspaces shared with logged in user.
    - Uses Azure Active Directory authentication.

- **Publish to web**: Anyone on Internet can view your published report or visual. This requires no authentication and includes viewing detail level data your reports aggregate. Before publishing a report, make sure you can share the data and visualizations publicly. Don't publish confidential or sensitive information. Refer to your organization's policies before publishing.

### General Power BI considerations

- [Portals Studio](../portals/portal-designer-anatomy.md) performance can degrade while working with Power BI workspaces because of the following Power BI workspace configurations:
    - High number of workspaces shared with logged in maker user.
    - Power BI workspaces are shared with many users.
- [Capture liquid variable](../portals/liquid/portals-entity-tags.md#powerbi) isn't supported in portals Studio while working with Power BI component.
- If you [reset portal](../portals/admin/reset-portal.md) and provision a new portal, you must add portal application ID of the new portal to the **Portal Power BI Embedded service** Azure AD security group. For more information, go to [Set up Power BI integration](../portals/admin/set-up-power-bi-integration.md#create-security-group-and-add-to-power-bi-account).
- If you make a change in Power Apps portals admin center, you must reload the portals Studio if you already have it open.
- Adding users to Power BI dashboards and reports may take a while to reflect in the portals Studio.

### Power BI performance and optimization considerations

Embedding multiple Power BI workspaces may need additional considerations. Refer to the following resources for Power BI embed scenario troubleshooting, optimization, and best practices:

- [Troubleshooting Power BI Embedded application content rendering](/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-troubleshoot#content-rendering).
- [Power BI Embedded performance best practices](/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-performance-best-practices).
- [Power BI optimization guide](/power-bi/guidance/power-bi-optimization).
