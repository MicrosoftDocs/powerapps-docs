# Update to Power Apps portals domain

If you provision a portal using the older portal add-on, the domain of your portal will be `microsoftcrmportals.com`. With the release of Power Apps portals, you can now update your Dynamics 365 domain `microsoftcrmportals.com` to the Power Apps portals domain `powerappsportals.com`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `microsoftcrmportals.com` domain is deprecated and is limited only to the portals provisioned using the older portal add-on. In deprecation period, this feature will continue to work and is fully supported until it is officially removed. This deprecation notification can span a few years.

1. Open [Power Apps Portals admin center](admin-overview.md).

2. Go to **Portal Actions** > **Update to Power Apps portal domain**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Update to Power Apps portal domain](../media/update-portal-domain-button.png "Update to Power Apps portal domain ")

3. In **Portal URL**, enter the address of the website and select **OK**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Update to Power Apps portal domain](../media/update-portal-domain.png "Update to Power Apps portal domain ")

If you are already using the Power Apps portals domain and would like to revert to the old domain, you can use the **Update to Power Apps portal domain** action to revert to the old domain. In this case, the message is displayed as follows:

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Revert to old domain](../media/revert-portal-domain.png "Revert to old domain ")
