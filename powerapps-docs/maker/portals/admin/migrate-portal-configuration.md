# Migrate portal configuration

Portal development involves several configurations and customizations to achieve a desired experience for portal end users.

After you have completed development or configuration of your portal instance, you might want to migrate your latest portal configuration from development to testing or the production environments. Migration involves exporting the existing configuration from the source Common Data Service environment, and then importing it into the target Common Data Service environment.

To export configuration data, you would need to use the Configuration Migration tool and a portal-specific configuration schema file. For more information about this tool, see [Manage configuration data](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-configuration-data).

> [!NOTE]
> - We recommend you to use the latest version of the Configuration Migration tool. The Configuration Migration tool can be downloaded from NuGet. More information for downloading the tool: [Download tools from NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/download-tools-nuget).
> - The minimum solution version of portals supported by schema files for configuration migration is 8.4.0.275. However, we recommend that you use the latest solution version.
> - Source and destination organizations must have same default language for the migration to work successfully.

Schema files are available for the following portal types:

- **Portals created in an environment with Common Data Service**
    - [Custom portal (Blank portal)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2110477)

- **Portals created in an environment containing model-driven apps in Dynamics 365**
    - [Custom portal (Blank portal)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2019804)
    - [Community portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2019704)
    - [Customer Self-Service portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2019705)
    - [Partner portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2019803)
    - [Employee Self-Service portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2019802)

The default schema files contain information about portal entities, relationships, and uniqueness definitions for each entity. More information: [Export portal configuration data](#export-portal-configuration-data)

After exporting the configuration data, you must import it into the target environment. More information: [Import portal configuration data](#import-portal-configuration-data)

> [!NOTE]
> The Configuration Migration tool uses schema to export and import configuration data. The tool does not migrate entities or entity schema. Migration may fail with missing elements such as entities and fields when configuration data has mismatch with selected schema.
>
> During export, ensure the source environment contains portal entities as specified in Configuration Migration tool schema file. You can still alter the schema files to add, remove, and modify entities, attributes, and so on to migrate subset of configuration data.
>
> During import, ensure the destination environment contains the same portal type already installed with any additional customizations such as entities, fields, forms or views imported separately as solutions.


## Export portal configuration data

You can export portal configuration data from a source system by using portal-specific configuration schema files.

1.	Download the Configuration Migration tool and extract to the desired folder.

2.	Download a portal configuration schema file using links provided above for your portal type.

3.	Double-click the **DataMigrationUtility.exe** file in the 
`<your_folder>\Tools\ConfigurationMigration` folder to run the Configuration Migration tool, choose **Export data** in the main screen, and then select **Continue**.
    
    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Export configuration data](../media/export-config-data.png "Export configuration data")

4.	On the **Login** screen, provide authentication details to connect to your Common Data Service environment from where you want to export data. If you have multiple organizations on the Common Data Service environment from where to export the data, select the **Display list of available organizations** check box, and then select **Login**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Provide authentication details to connect to your Common Data Service environment from where you want to export data](../media/export-config-login.png "Provide authentication details to connect to your Common Data Service environment from where you want to export data")

5.	If you have multiple organizations, and you had selected the **Display list of available organizations** check box in the previous step, the next screen allows you to choose the organization that you want to connect to. Select a Common Data Service environment to connect to. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not have multiple organizations, this screen is not displayed.

6.	In **Schema file**, browse and select the portal-specific configuration schema file to be used for the data export.

7.	In **Save to data file**, specify the name and location of the data file to be exported.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Specify schema and target files](../media/export-config-file-name.png "Specify schema and target files")

8.	Select **Export Data**. The screen displays the export progress status and the location of the exported file at the bottom of the screen once the export is complete.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Progress of configuration data export](../media/export-config-status.png "Progress of configuration data export")

9.	Select **Exit** to close the tool.

## Import portal configuration data

1.	Run the Configuration Migration tool and choose **Import data** in the main screen, and then select **Continue**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Import configuration data](../media/import-config-data.png "Import configuration data")

2.	On the **Login** screen, provide authentication details to connect to your Common Data Service environment from where you want to export data. If you have multiple organizations on the Common Data Service environment from where to export the data, select the **Display list of available organizations** check box, and then select **Login**.

3.	If you have multiple organizations, and you had selected the **Display list of available organizations** check box in the previous step, the next screen allows you to choose the organization that you want to connect to. Select a Common Data Service environment to connect to. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If you do not have multiple organizations, this screen is not displayed.
    > - Ensure that the portal solution is already installed for the organization where you plan to import the configurations.

4.	The next screen prompts you to provide the data file (.zip) to be imported. Browse to the data file, select it, and then select **Import Data**. 

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Progress of configuration data import](../media/import-config-status.png "Progress of configuration data import")

5.	The next screen displays the import status of your records. The data import is done in multiple passes to first import the foundation data while queuing up the dependent data, and then import the dependent data in the subsequent passes to handle any data dependencies or linkages. This action ensures clean and consistent data import. 

6.	Select **Exit** to close the tool. 

## Tenant to tenant migration

Power Apps portals doesn't support tenant to tenant migration. To migrate a portal from one tenant to another, you must follow these steps:

1. [Reset](reset-portal.md) your portal in the source tenant.

1. Provision a new portal in an environment [with Common Data Service](../create-portal.md) or [containing model-driven apps in Dynamics 365](../create-dynamics-portal.md).

1. Migrate portal configurations and customizations using the [export](#export-portal-configuration-data) and [import](#import-portal-configuration-data) steps explained in this article earlier.
