# Update the Power Apps portals solution

A Power Apps portal consists of solutions from different packages in an environment. You can use the Power Platform admin center to:

- View the details of installed packages (such as the version details).
- Update installed packages for the selected portal, if a package with a higher version is available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Updating packages might take some time. While the upgrade is in progress, you might see some instability in your portal; hence, we recommend that you update packages during off-peak hours.
> - Solutions in a package are upgraded for an environment. Hence, the selected package will be upgraded for all portals in the environment using the package.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also update solution packages for Power Pages sites. More information: [What is Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction).

## Required permissions
