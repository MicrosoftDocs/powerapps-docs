# Portal checker

Portal checker is a self-service diagnostic tool that can be used by portal administrators to identify common issues in their portal. Portal checker helps to identify issues with a portal by looking at various configuration parameters and it provides suggestions on how to fix them.

When you run portal checker, the results are displayed in the **Diagnostic results** section in a grid format. The results grid has the following columns:

- **Issue**: Displays the top-level issue faced by a customer; for example, performance issue.
- **Category**: Displays the top-level area where issues can be categorized; for example, provisioning or solution upgrade.
- **Result**: Displays the status of the issue; for example, error or warning.

By default, information in the grid is sorted by the **Result** column in this order: error, warning, and pass.

You can expand an issue to view detailed information and mitigation steps. If the mitigation requires any action, you'll see a button that will perform the action. You can also provide feedback on whether the mitigation was useful.

If required, you can rerun the diagnostic checks, which will refresh the results with updated data.

> [!NOTE]
> If portal is turned off or IP address filtering is enabled, certain diagnostic checks will not be run on your portal.
