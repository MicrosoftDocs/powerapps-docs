# Manage portals from the Power Platform admin center

You can now manage portals in the Power Platform admin center. The Power Platform admin center helps you manage both capacity-based and add-on portals. You can also see information such as how many days are left before a trial portal expires. For more information about portal licensing, see the [licensing FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#portals) and [portal differences](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/faq#what-is-the-difference-between-power-apps-portals-dynamics-365-portals-and-add-on-portals).

You can manage portals in the Power Platform admin center in two ways: You can manage all portals for the current tenant from **Resources** > **Portals**, and you can manage portals for a specific environment from **Environments**.

## Manage all portals for a tenant

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. In the left pane, select **Resources**, and then select **Portals**.

1. Select a portal.

1. To manage the portal, select **More portal actions** (**...**), and then select **Manage**. Alternatively, you can select the portal and then select **Manage** at the top of the page.

## Manage the portal add-on

Using the Power Platform admin center to manage portals as described in this article replaces earlier functionality, which is illustrated in the following image.

### Portal types

The following table describes the different types of portals that are listed in the Power Platform admin center.

| Type                |Description                                                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Production          | A production portal based on a capacity-based license.               |
| Trial (*n* days)    | A trial portal based on a capacity-based license, with _n_ days remaining until suspension. |
| Production (add-on) | A production portal based on an add-on license.     |
| Trial (add-on)      | A trial portal based on an add-on license.          |

### Portal status

A portal can have the following status: *Configured*, *Suspended*, or *Not-configured*. The following table describes each state.

| Status         |  Description    |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Configured     | This portal has been configured to an environment.     |
| Suspended      | This portal has been suspended because its trial period is over. It will be deleted in seven days, unless it's converted to a production portal. |
| Not-configured | This portal is ready to be configured to an environment.   |

> [!NOTE]
> You can [create a new portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/provision-portal-add-on) if the portal add-on status is *Not-configured*. The status will change to *Configured* after the portal is provisioned.
