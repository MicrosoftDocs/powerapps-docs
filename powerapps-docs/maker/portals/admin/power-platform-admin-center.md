# Manage portals from the Power Platform admin center


[!INCLUDE[cc-pages-ga-banner](../../../includes/cc-pages-ga-banner.md)]

You can now use the Power Platform admin center to manage portals that have both capacity-based and add-on licenses. You can also see information such as how many days are left before a trial portal expires. For more information about portal licensing, go to the [licensing FAQ](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#portals) and [portal differences](../overview.md#power-apps-portals-dynamics-365-portals-and-add-on-portals). For more information about the Power Platform admin center, go to [Administer Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation).

You can manage portals in the Power Platform admin center in two ways:

- Manage all portals for the current tenant from **Resources** > **Portals**.
- Manage portals for a specific environment from **Environments**.

## Manage all portals for a tenant

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. On the left pane, select **Resources**, and then select **Portals**.

## Portal types in the admin center

The following table describes the different types of portals that are listed in the Power Platform admin center.

## Portal status in the admin center

A portal can have the following status: *Configured*, *Suspended*, or *Not configured*. The following table describes each state.

| Status         |  Description    |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Configured     | This portal has been configured to an environment.     |
| Suspended      | This portal has been suspended because its trial period is over. It will be deleted in seven days, unless it's converted to a production portal. |
| Not configured | This portal is ready to be configured to an environment.   |

> [!NOTE]
> You can [create a new portal](../provision-portal-add-on.md) if the portal add-on status is *Not configured*. The status will change to *Configured* after the portal is provisioned.
