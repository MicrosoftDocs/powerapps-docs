# Maintenance mode for a portal

There might be times when your website is under scheduled maintenance or is down due to temporary outage. When a customer accesses the website during maintenance, unpredictable behavior and intermittent unavailability might be experienced. 

As a portal administrator, you can configure your portal to display a proper message to customers whenever a maintenance activity is going on (for example, "Solution packages are being upgraded.") You can leverage this capability by enabling the maintenance mode on your portal. When the maintenance mode is enabled, a message is displayed, and the customers are restricted from browsing any webpages except the `<portal URL>/_services/about` page.

## Enable maintenance mode

You can enable maintenance mode on your portal to provide a consistent message, instead of dealing with unpredictable behavior when your website is under scheduled maintenance. This will provide a better experience for your portal users.

1. Open [Power Apps Portals admin center](admin-overview.md).

3. Go to **Portal Actions** > **Enable maintenance mode**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Enable maintenance mode](../media/enable-maint-mode-button.png "Enable maintenance mode")

4. In the **Enable maintenance mode** window, enter the following values:
    - **Select page to be used when maintenance mode is enabled**: Select one of the following values:

        - **Default page**: Select this value if you want the default page to be displayed when maintenance mode is enabled. By default, this option is selected.

        - **Custom page**: Select this value if you want a custom HTML page to be displayed when maintenance mode is enabled.

    - **Custom page URL**: This field is enabled only when you select the option to display a custom HTML page. You must ensure that the page URL you provide is publicly accessible. If the specified HTML page can't be reached, the default page is displayed with a note to the administrators.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The custom maintenance page uses IFrame to display the page. Hence, the page should not contain the `x-frame-options:SAMEORIGIN` response header, else the page will not load.

5. Select **Enable**. While maintenance mode is being enabled, the portal restarts and is unavailable for a few minutes.

    > ![Enable maintenance mode settings](../media/enable-maint-mode.png "Enable maintenance mode settings")

## Configure or disable maintenance mode

After enabling maintenance mode for your portal, you can update the maintenance mode settings and choose a different page.

You can also choose to disable maintenance mode on your portal when the scheduled maintenance of your website is complete. Your portal users can now browse and access all web pages as usual.

1. Open [Power Apps Portals admin center](admin-overview.md).

2. Go to **Portal Actions** > **Configure or disable maintenance mode**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Configure maintenance mode](../media/configure-maint-mode-button.png "Configure maintenance mode")

3. Modify the settings as required, and select **Update**. For example, you might choose to display the default page if you've selected to display the custom page earlier.

4. To disable maintenance mode, select **Disable**. While maintenance mode is being updated or disabled, the portal restarts and is unavailable for a few minutes.
