# Convert a portal

As explained in the [portal lifecycle](portal-lifecycle.md) article earlier, a Power Apps portals goes through different stages. You can convert a portal from one stage to another, depending on what conversion is allowed, and whether the environment has the required license, or capacity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [table permission changes for forms and lists](../important-changes-deprecations.md#table-permission-changes-for-forms-and-lists-on-new-portals) introduced with the portals release version [9.3.7.x](/power-platform/released-versions/portals/portalupdate1) also take effect on a portal that's converted from trial to production.

## Convert a portal from trial to production

You can convert a trial portal to a production portal from the notifications displayed in the Power Apps Portals admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be assigned one of the following roles to convert a portal from trial to production:
> - Global administrator
> - System administrator
>
> More information: [Admin roles required for portal administrative tasks](portal-admin-roles.md)

When you open the [Power Apps Portals admin center](admin-overview.md) and go to the **[Portal Details](portal-details.md)** tab, you'll see the notification about the trial expiration displayed below the **Type** field.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Trial notification on the Portal Details tab.](../media/admin-center-convert-notif.png "Trial notification on the Portal Details tab")

On other pages in the admin center, the notification is displayed at the top of the page.

> [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
> ![Trial notification on other pages.](../media/admin-center-convert-notif-all.png "Trial notification on other pages")

To convert your portal from trial to production:

1.	In the notification, select **Convert**.

2.	Select **Confirm**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the portal has been converted to production, you should ensure that the portal is appropriately licensed with page views and logins corresponding to the expected user volume. Not having appropriate licenses assigned can result in degraded performance. For information on how to allocate page views and logins, see [Allocate or change capacity in an environment](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on#allocate-or-change-capacity-in-an-environment).

## Convert an existing portal to capacity-based model

You can convert your existing portal license to [capacity-based licensing model](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#can-you-share-more-details-regarding-the-new-power-apps-portals-licensing). To change your portal license to capacity-based model:

> [!TIP]
> To learn about the roles required to perform this task, read [Admin roles required for portal administrative tasks](portal-admin-roles.md).

1. Go to [Portal details](portal-details.md).
1. Select **Change License**.

    ![Convert an existing portal to a capacity-based model.](media/portal-lifecycle/convert-to-capacity-based-licensing.gif "Convert an existing portal to a capacity-based model")

Consider the following before changing your portal license:

- Your portal will restart and won't be available for a few minutes during license conversion. You might need to schedule this for a downtime period for business users.
- Your environment must have an appropriate [license](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#portals) available and assigned before you convert the license.
- You must have administrative privileges to convert the license.
- Only production environments can be converted from an existing license to a capacity-based license. If you have a [trial environment](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments), you must convert it to a production environment first.

## Considerations for conversion of add-on portals

The following sections describe the conditions that apply to portals that were [provisioned by using the portal add-on plan](../provision-portal-add-on.md).

### Trial add-on portal

A trial add-on portal expires after 30 days. An expired portal is suspended for seven days. The portal is deleted after the suspension period ends. A trial add-on portal can still be converted to a production portal during the period when it has either been configured to an environment or suspended.

### Production add-on portal

A production add-on portal expires at the end of the purchased license period. The suspension period for a production add-on portal can vary depending on the license plan you purchased. The portal is deleted after the suspension period ends. You can extend the license of a production add-on portal while the portal is in a configured or suspended state. If it has been suspended, the portal can be converted to a configured state after you extend the license period.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid functionality loss by having your portal suspended or deleted, ensure that you've extended the license period in a timely manner, well before expiry.

### Suspended add-on portal

Portal [provisioned using portal add-on plan](../provision-portal-add-on.md) purchased earlier is suspended at the end of expiration. This expiration period is 30 days for trial portals while it may vary for an add-on portal in production with a purchased license. Suspended trial portal is deleted after 7 days while suspension period may vary for production portal.

### Reset add-on portal

Follow the steps in [Reset a portal](reset-portal.md) to reset a portal that was provisioned by using a previously purchased, portal add-on plan.
