## Add yourself as an owner of the Azure AD application

If you aren't a global administrator and you try to manage a portal that has already been provisioned, or you resubmit the provisioning if it failed, you must be the owner of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application connected to your portal.

1. Go to the Power Apps portals admin center and open the **Portal Details** tab.

2. Copy the value from the **Application ID** field.

    > ![Portal Details tab.](../media/portal-details-admin.png "Portal Details tab")

3. Go to Azure AD associated with your tenant. [!include[](../../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Take over an unmanaged directory as administrator in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-manage-o365-subscription)

4. In Azure AD, search for the app registration by using the application ID you copied. You might need to switch from **My apps** to **All apps**.

5. Add users or groups as owners of this app registration. [!include[](../../../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Managing access to apps](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-managing-access-to-apps)

    > [!Note]
    > This task can be performed either by a global administrator of your organization or the existing owner of this application.

6. After you've added yourself as an owner, reopen the Power Apps portals admin center page.
