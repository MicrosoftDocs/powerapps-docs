# Get your developer environment (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

By default, Microsoft Power Platform app makers can create up to three developer type environments. Developer environments are special environments intended only for use by the owner. Use these environments to build, test, and perform application lifecycle management (ALM) with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a preview feature.

Developer type environments allow you to:

- Create apps and flows without writing code, with full-featured Power Apps and Power Automate development tools. Easily share and collaborate on these solutions with others.

- Use a fully managed, scalable data platform with [Dataverse](/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction), including support for common business application actions. Use out-of-the-box common tables or build your own data schema.

- Export the solutions you create in your developer environment and then import them into other Power Platform environments so users can test and use them.

## Prerequisites

To create a developer environment, you need an active Power Platform plan that includes Dataverse. More information: [Licensing overview for Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus)

## Create your own developer type environment

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. Follow the instructions on your screen to create your environment.

## Create your own environment when you sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you up to three free development type environments to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse. The developer environments maintained under this plan will be available as long as you actively use the Power Apps Developer Plan.
