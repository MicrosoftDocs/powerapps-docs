# How to create and edit fields

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

In Common Data Service fields define the individual data items that can be used to store data in an entity. Fields are sometimes called *attributes* by developers. 
  
Before you create a custom field, evaluate whether using an existing field would meet your requirements. More information: [Create new metadata or use existing metadata?](create-edit-metadata.md#create-new-metadata-or-use-existing-metadata)

There are two designers you can use to create or edit fields:

|Designer| Description|
|--|--|
|[Power Apps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc)|Provides an easy streamlined experience, but some special settings are not available.<br />More information: [Create and edit fields for Common Data Service using Power Apps portal](create-edit-field-portal.md)|
|Solution explorer|Not as easy, but provides for more flexibility for less common requirements.<br />More information: [Create and edit fields for Common Data Service using Power Apps solution explorer](create-edit-field-solution-explorer.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create fields in your environment using the following:
> - In model-driven apps, select **New Field** from the form editor.
> - Import a solution that contains the definition of the fields.
> - Use Power Query to create new entities and fill them with data.<br />More information: [Add data to an entity in the Common Data Service by using Power Query](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-cds-newentity-pq).
> - A developer can use [Metadata services](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/use-web-services#metadata-services) to write a program to create and update fields.

Information in this topic will help you choose which designer you can use. 

You should use the Power Apps portal to Create and edit fields for Common Data Service unless you need to address any of the following requirements:

- Create a Customer Lookup field. 
   - More information: [Different types of lookups](types-of-fields.md#different-types-of-lookups)
- Create a field in a solution other than the Common Data Service Default solution. 
   - More information: [Solutions overview](solutions-overview.md)
- Define status reason transitions. 
   - More information: [Define status reason transitions for the Case or custom entities](define-status-reason-transitions.md)
- Edit multiple fields at once.
- Enable Auditing. 
   - More information: [Auditing overview](../../developer/common-data-service/auditing-overview.md)
- Enable Field Level Security. 
   - More information: [Field security entities](../../developer/common-data-service/field-security-entities.md)
- Select whether the field appears in global filter in interactive experience. 
   - More information: [Configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards](../model-driven-apps/configure-interactive-experience-dashboards.md)
- Select whether the field is sortable in interactive experience dashboards. 
   - More information: [Configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards](../model-driven-apps/configure-interactive-experience-dashboards.md)
- Set a field Requirement Level as Business Recommended. 
   - More information: [Create business rules and recommendations to apply logic in a model-driven app form](../model-driven-apps/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)
- Set managed properties for a field. 
   - More information: [Set managed properties for fields](set-managed-properties-for-field.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can create a Lookup field in the Power Apps portal or in solution explorer by creating a One-to-many relationship on the entity. But only solution explorer offers the option to create this relationship while creating a field.
