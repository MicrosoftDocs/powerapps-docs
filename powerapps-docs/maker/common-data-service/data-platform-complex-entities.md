# Complex entities and licensing

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *This topic is applicable only for older Power Apps Plan 1 and Plan 2 licenses.*
>
> Complex entities are applicable *only* for the older Power Apps Plan 1 and Plan 2 licenses, and not for the latest Power Apps per app and Power Apps per user plans.
> 
> For the latest information on licensing requirements for entities, see the [Power Apps licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2085130).

Entities that include the following complex server-side logic require users of an app or flow that uses these entities to have a Power Apps Plan 2 or Power Automate Plan 2 license:

* Code plug-ins. More information: [Plug-in development](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/plug-ins)
* Real-time workflows. More information: [Workflow processes](/flow/workflow-processes)

    > [!NOTE]
    >  Only workflows that are converted to a real-time workflow are considered real-time and synchronous. Workflows that are run in the background can still be used with the appropriate Power Apps plan and do not require additional licenses.

To know whether or not you've added complex business logic to your entities, review the list of plug-in assemblies and workflows configured in your environment.

## Complex entities installed with Dynamics 365 apps
The following table lists entities that contain complex server-side logic out-of-the-box as part of the installation of customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 (Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and Project Service Automation). This list is intended as a guide. Depending on the Dynamics 365 apps and versions installed in your environment, the list of complex entities may vary.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are using the Common Data Service and have not installed a Dynamics 365 app or third-party solution, your environment won't have entities containing complex server-side logic.
