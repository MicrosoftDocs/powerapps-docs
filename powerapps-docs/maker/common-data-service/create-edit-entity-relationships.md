# Entity relationships 
Entity relationships define how records can be related to each other in the database. At the simplest level, adding a lookup field to an entity creates a new 1:N (one-to-many) relationship between the two entities and lets you put that lookup field in a form. With the lookup field, users can associate multiple *child* records of that entity to a single *parent* entity record.  
  
Beyond simply defining how records can be related to other records, 1:N entity relationships also provide data to address the following questions:  
  
- When I delete a record should any records related to that record also be deleted?  
- When I assign a record, do I also need to assign all records related to that record to the new owner?  
- How can I streamline the data entry process when I create a new related record in the context of an existing record?  
- How should people viewing a record be able to view the associated records?  
  
 Entities can also participate in a N:N (many-to-many) relationship where any number of records for two entities can be associated with each other.

## Decide whether to use entity relationships or connections 
Entity relationships are metadata that make changes to the database. These relationships allow for queries to retrieve related data very efficiently. Use entity relationships to define formal relationships that define the entity or that most records can use. For example, an opportunity without a potential customer wouldn't be very useful. The Opportunity entity also has a N:N relationship with the Competitor entity. This allows for multiple competitors to be added to the opportunity. You may want to capture this data and create a report that shows the competitors.  
  
There are other less formal kinds of relationships between records that are called *connections*. For example, it may be useful to know if two contacts are married, or perhaps they are friends outside of work, or perhaps a contact used to work for another account. Most businesses won't generate reports using this kind of information or require that it is entered, so it's probably not worthwhile to create entity relationships.

## Types of entity relationships
When you look at the solution explorer you might think that there are three types of entity relationships. Actually there are only two, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Relationship Type|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|**1:N (One-to-Many)**|An entity relationship where one entity record for the **Primary Entity** can be associated to many other **Related Entity** records because of a lookup field on the related entity.<br /><br /> When viewing a primary entity record you can see a list of the related entity records that are associated with it.<br /><br /> In the Power Apps portal, **Current Entity** represents the primary entity.|  
|**N:N (Many-to-Many)**|An entity relationship that depends on a special **Relationship Entity**, sometimes called an Intersect entity, so that many records of one entity can be related to many records of another entity.<br /><br /> When viewing records of either entity in a N:N relationship you can see a list of any records of the other entity that are related to it.|  
  
The **N:1 (many-to-one)** relationship type exists in the user interface because the designer shows you a view grouped by entities. 1:N relationships actually exist *between* entities and refer to each entity as either a **Primary/Current Entity** or **Related Entity**. The related entity, sometimes called the *child* entity, has a lookup field that allows storing a reference to a record from the primary entity, sometimes called the *parent* entity. A N:1 relationship is just a 1:N relationship viewed from the related entity.  
 
## Entity relationship behavior
Behaviors  for related entities is important because it helps ensure data integrity and can automate business processes for your company.

### Preserve data integrity
Some entities exist to support other entities. They don't make sense on their own. They will typically have a required lookup field to link to the primary entity they support. What should happen when the primary record is deleted?

You can use the relationship behavior to define this according to the rules for your business. Two options are:

- Prevent deleting the primary entity so that the related entity records can be reconciled, perhaps by associating them with a different primary entity.
- Allow the related entities to be deleted automatically with the deletion of the primary entity record.

If the related entity doesn't support a primary entity, you can allow the primary entity to be deleted and the value of the lookup will be cleared.

### Automate business processes
Let's say that you have a new salesperson and you want to assign them a number of existing accounts currently assigned to another salesperson. Each account record may have a number of task activities associated with it. You can easily locate the active accounts you want to reassign and assign them to the new salesperson. But what should happen for any of the task activities that are associated with the accounts? Do you want to open each task and decide whether they should also be assigned to the new salesperson? Probably not. Instead, you can let the relationship apply some standard rules for you automatically. These rules only apply to task records associated to the accounts you are reassigning. Your options are:  
  
- Reassign all active tasks.  
- Reassign all tasks. 
- Reassign none of the tasks.  
- Reassign all tasks currently assigned to the former owner of the accounts.  
  
The relationship can control how actions performed on a record for the primary entity record cascade down to any related entity records.  

### Behaviors
There are several kinds of behaviors that can be applied when certain actions occur.

|Behavior|Description|
|--|--|
|**Cascade Active**|Perform the action on all active related entity records.|
|**Cascade All**|Perform the action on all related entity records.|
|**Cascade None**|Do nothing.|
|**Remove Link**|Remove the lookup value for all related records.|
|**Restrict**|Prevent the primary entity record from being deleted when related entity records exist.|
|**Cascade User Owned**|Perform the action on all related entity records owned by the same user as the primary entity record.|

### Actions
These are the actions that can trigger certain behaviors:

|Field|Description|Options|
|--|--|--|
|**Assign**|What should happen when the primary entity record is assigned to someone else?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Reparent**|What should happen when the lookup value of a related entity in a parental relationship is changed?<br />More information: [Parental entity relationships](#parental-entity-relationships)|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Share**|What should happen when the primary entity record is shared?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Delete**|What should happen when the primary entity record is deleted?|Cascade All<br />Remove Link<br />Restrict|
|**Unshare**|What should happen when a primary entity record is unshared?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Merge**|What should happen when a primary entity record is merged?|Cascade All<br />Cascade None|
|**Rollup View**|What is the desired behavior of the rollup view associated with this relationship? |Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|

> [!NOTE]
> Assign, Delete, Merge, and Reparent actions will not execute in the following situations:
> - If the original parent record and requested action contain the same values. Example: Attempting to trigger an Assign and 
>   choosing a contact that is already the owner of the record
> - Attempting to perform an action on a parent record that is already running a cascading action

> [!NOTE]
> When executing an assign, any workflows or business rules that are currently active on the records will automatically be 
> deactivated when the reassignment occurs. The new owner of the record will need to reactivate the workflow or business rule 
> if they want to continue using it.

### Parental entity relationships
Each pair of entities that are eligible to have a 1:N relationship can have multiple 1:N relationships between them. Yet usually only one of those relationships can be considered a parental entity relationship.

A parental entity relationship is any 1:N entity relationship where one of the cascading options in the **Parental** column of the following table is true.

|Action|Parental|Not Parental|  
|------------|--------------|------------------|  
|**Assign**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Delete**|Cascade All|RemoveLink<br />Restrict|  
|**Reparent**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Share**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Unshare**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  

For example, if you create a new custom entity and add a 1:N entity relationship with the account entity where your custom entity is the related entity, you can configure the actions for that entity relationship to use the options in the **Parental** column. If you later add another 1:N entity relationship with your custom entity as the referencing entity you can only configure the actions to use the options in the **Not Parental** column.

Usually this means that for each entity pair there is only one parental relationship. There are some cases where the lookup on the related entity may allow for a relationship to more than one type of entity.

For example, if an entity has a Customer lookup that can refer to either a contact or account entity. There are two separate parental 1:N entity relationships.

Any activity entity has a similar set of parental entity relationships for entities that can be associated using the regarding lookup field.

<a name="BKMK_RelationshipBehaviorLimitations"></a>   

### Limitations on behaviors you can set
Because of parental relationships there are some limitations you should keep in mind when you define entity relationships.  
  
- A custom entity can't be the primary entity in a relationship with a related system entity that cascades. This means you can't have a relationship with any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned** between a primary custom entity and a related system entity.  
- No new relationship can have any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned** if the related entity in that relationship already exists as a related entity in another relationship that has any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned**. This prevents relationships that create a multi-parent relationship.  

### Inherited access rights cleanup

Using Reparent and Share cascading behaviors are helpful when you want to provide access to records across related entities. But there can be a change in process or design that requires a change of the cascading behavior settings.

When an entity relationship uses Reparent or Share, and the cascading behavior is changed from **Cascade All** to **Cascade None**, the entity relationship prevents any new permission changes from cascading to the related child entities. In addition, inherited permissions that were granted while the cascading behavior was active must be revoked.

Inherited access rights cleanup is a system job that cleans up the legacy inherited access rights that remain after the cascading behavior is changed from **Cascade All** to **Cascade None**. This cleanup will not affect any user that was directly granted access to an entity, but will remove access from anyone who received access through inheritance only.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, to run inherited access rights cleanup requires using the Web API. More information: [CreateAsyncJobToRevokeInheritedAccess Action](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/createasyncjobtorevokeinheritedaccess?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9)

<!-- Automatic triggering to come later-- remove above alert at that time. The cleanup is automatically triggered when you switch Reparent or Share cascading behaviors from All to None. No action is required. -->

This is how inherited access rights cleanup works:

1. Identifies and collects all the entities that were in a cascading relationship with the updated parent.

2. Identifies and collects the users that were granted access to the related entities through inherited access.

3. Checks for users who were given direct access to a related entity and removes them from the collection.

4. Removes inherited access for the collected users on the collected entities.

After the cleanup runs, users who were able to access related entities only because of the cascading feature can no longer access the records, ensuring greater security.
