# Export solutions  
You can manually export solutions using the steps in this article. We recommend that you create an unmanaged solution to use for exporting your customizations, and then export your customizations periodically so that you have a backup in case anything happens. You can't export [managed](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#managed-and-unmanaged-solutions) solutions or the [Default Solution](solutions-overview.md#default-solutions). 
 
> [!NOTE]
> To implement healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) in your organization, consider using a source control system to store and collaborate on your solutions, and automate the solution export process. More information: [ALM basics](/power-platform/alm/basics-alm) in the Power Platform ALM guide. 

## Export from Power Apps
  
1.  Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and select **Solutions** from the left navigation.   
  
2.  In the list of solutions, select the unmanaged solution you want to export, and then select **Export**. Notice that you can't export managed solutions. 

3. The **Before you export** right pane appears. Choose from the following options, and then select **Next**:  
    - **Publish all changes**. Notice that, when you export an unmanaged solution, only published components are exported. We recommend that you select **Publish all changes** to make sure all components are included in the exported solution. 
    - **Check for issues**. Run the solution checker against the solution to detect performance and stability issues.

4.  The **Export this solution** right pane appears. Enter or select from the following options, and then select **Export**:  
    - **Version number**: Power Apps automatically increments your solution version while displaying the current version. You can accept the default version or enter your own. 
    - **Export as**: Select the package type, either **Managed** or **Unmanaged**. More information: [Managed and unmanaged solutions](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#managed-and-unmanaged-solutions)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Export solution](media/solution-export.png "Export solution")

The export can take several minutes to complete. Once finished, the export .zip file is available in the download folder specified by your web browser.

## Export using the classic experience

1.  Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and select **Solutions** from the left navigation. Select **Switch to classic**. 
  
2.  In the list select the solution you want to export and then select **Export**. 
  
3.  In the **Publish Customizations** step you will be reminded that only published customizations are exported and you will have the option to **Publish All Customizations** before you select **Next**.  
  
4.  If your solution contains any missing required components you will see the **Missing Required Components** step. You can disregard this warning only if you intend to import this as an unmanaged solution back into the original environment. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the dialog to cancel the export and add the required components.  
  
5.  In the **Export System Settings (Advanced)** step you can choose certain system settings to include in your solution. If your solution depends on any of the groups of system settings, select them and select **Next**.  
  
     See **Settings options for solution export** below for details about the settings that will be included with each option.  
  
6.  In the **Package Type** step, you must choose whether to export the solution as an **Unmanaged** or **Managed** solution.  
  
7.  The next step allows you to choose a target solution for a specific version. This option is typically used by ISVs who may want to export a solution that is compliant with a previous version. Unless you intend to import this solution into an environment that is not upgraded to the same version as the environment version you are using, accept the default.   
  
8.  Select **Export** to download the solution file.  
  
 The exact behavior for downloading files varies between web browsers.
