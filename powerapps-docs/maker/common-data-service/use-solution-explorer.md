# Use solutions in PowerApps

 Within PowerApps, you can view a list of solutions by selecting **Solutions** in the left navigation. You can then select a solution to view all of its components. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Demo solution with all components](media/solution-all-items-list.PNG "Demo solution with all components")  
 
> [!NOTE]
>  The solutioning experience is available only online and for environment version 9.1.0.267 and later. To check your version, please go to …[PowerApps admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/)> **Environments** > select your environment > **Details** tab. For earlier version environments, selecting a solution opens it in the classic experience.  
 
 You can browse through all the components in a solution by scrolling through the items. If there are more then 100 items in the list you can select **Load the next 100 items** to see more. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Load more components](media/load-more.PNG "Load more components")  

 ## Search and filter in a solution
 
 You can also search for a specific component by its name. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Search component](media/solution-search-box.png "Search component")  
 
 Or filter all items in the list by the component type.
  
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Filter component by type](media/solution-filter.PNG "Filter component by type")  
 
 ## Contextual commands
 
 As you select each component, the actions available in the command bar will change depending on the type of the component you have selected and if the solution is the default or a managed one. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Component specific commands](media/component-commands.png "Component specific commands")  
 
 When you don't select any component, the command bar will show actions applied to the solution itself. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Solution specific commands](media/solution-commands.PNG "Solution specific commands")  
 
 ## Create components in a solution
 With solutions that are unmanaged or the default one, you can use the **New** command to create different types of components. This takes you to a different create experience depending on the component type that you choose. After you finish creating the component, it will be added to the solution. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Create new component in a solution](media/solution-new-component.PNG "Create new component in a solution")  
 
 ## Add an existing component to a solution
 
 With solutions that are unmanaged and not the default one, you can use the **Add existing** command to bring in components that aren’t already in the solution.  
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Add existing component to a solution](media/solution-add-existing-component.PNG "Add existing component to a solution")  
  
 With solutions that are managed, only certain commands are available and you’ll see the message as shown below. You’ll need to locate the component in the solution named **Default Solution** and try to edit it there or add it to another unmanaged solution that you’ve created. The component might not be customizable. More information: [Managed properties](solutions-overview.md#managed-properties)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Managed solution](media/managed-solution.PNG "Managed solution")  

 Many of the customizations you’ll want to do will involve entities. You can use the **Entity** filter to show a list of all the entities in the current solution that can be customized in some way. Once you drill into an entity, you can see the components that are part of the entity as shown with the account entity in the following screenshot. 
   
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Demo solution showing expanded account entity](media/solution-entity-account.png "Demo solution showing expanded account entity")  

## Classic solution explorer

In PowerApps, you can view the classic solution explorer by selecting **Solutions** in the left navigation pane, and then selecting **Switch to classic** in the command bar. Classic solution explorer is the one that was previously available through the **Settings > Advanced customizations** area in PowerApps. If you are a Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement user, you use the classic solution explorer to work with solutions.  

## Known limitations

- Custom connectors are not available in a solution.
- Canvas apps must be opened after a solution is imported to update the connections.
- If a canvas app is packaged in a managed solution, it can still be edited in the target environment.
- Dependencies are not available for canvas apps.
- Deleting a managed solution will not rollback to a different canvas app's version. 
-	Canvas app access (CRUD and security) is managed entirely in PowerApps and not the Common Data Service (Common Data Service) database.
-	Common Data Service APIs to call canvas apps are blocked and don't return anything. 
-	Canvas apps and Flows created in a solution can't be shared as co-owner to an AAD Security Group.
-	Canvas apps won't display in the classic solution explorer.
- Button triggered Flows are not available in solutions.
- Canvas app triggered Flows are not available in solutions.
- Flows triggered from Microsoft 365 applications such as SharePoint and Excel are not available in solutions.
- In a solution, you can create a flow that uses the Common Data Service connector or the new Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector. However, adding a flow that was created outside a solution that uses either isn't supported due to potential failures.
