# Publish changes 

 Certain customizations that make changes to the user interface require that they be published before people can use them in the application. 
 
## Publish your customizations

1.  Select **Solutions** from the left navigation.

2.  Select the solution that you want to publish to open it.

3.  From the list of commands, select **Publish all customizations**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Preparing customizations may take some time. If you see a message that the browser page has become unresponsive, wait for the page to become responsive, and don't close it.
