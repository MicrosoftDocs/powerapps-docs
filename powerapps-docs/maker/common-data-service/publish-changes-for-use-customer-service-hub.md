# Publish changes 

 Certain customizations that make changes to the user interface require that they be published before people can use them in the application. 
 
## Publish your customizations

- In the solution explorer, select **Publish All Customizations**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Preparing customizations may take some time. If you see a message that the browser page has become unresponsive, wait for the page to become responsive, and don't close it.
