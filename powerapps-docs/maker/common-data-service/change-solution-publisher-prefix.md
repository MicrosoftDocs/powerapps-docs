# Solution publisher overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Every app you create or customization you make is part of a solution. Every solution has a publisher. You specify the publisher when you create a solution. 

The solution publisher indicates who developed the app. For this reason, you should create a solution publisher that is meaningful. You can view the solution publisher for a solution by selecting **Settings** from the **Solutions** area in Power Apps.

For more information about the solution publisher, see [Solution publisher](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#solution-publisher).

## Create a solution publisher
1.	In the Power Apps portal, select **Solutions**. 
2.	On the command bar, select **New solution**, in the right pane select the **Publisher** drop down list, and then select **+ Publisher**. 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > <img src="media/create-new-pubisher.png" alt="Create a new publisher" height="738" width="400">
3.	In the **New Publisher** form, enter the required and optional information: 
   - **Display Name**. Enter the display name for the publisher. 
   - **Name**. Enter the unique name for the publisher. 
   - **Prefix**. Enter the publisher prefix you want. 
   -	**Option Value Prefix**. This field generates a number based on the publisher prefix. This number is used when you add options to option sets and provides an indicator of which solution was used to add the option. 
   - **Contact Details**. Optionally, you can add contact and address information.
4. Select **Save and Close**.

## Change a solution publisher
You can change a solution publisher for an unmanaged solution by following these steps:
1.	In the Power Apps portal, select **Solutions**, select **â€¦** next to the solution you want, and then select **Settings**. 
2.	In the **Solution settings** pane, select **Edit publisher**. 
3.	Edit the **Display name** and **Prefix** fields to the values you want. The **Option Value Prefix** field generates a number based on the publisher prefix. This number is used when you add options to option sets and provides an indicator of which solution was used to add the option. 
4.	In addition to the prefix, you can also change the solution publisher display name, contact information, and address in the **Contact Details** section. 
5.	Select **Save and Close**.
