# Use the Common Data Services Default Solution  
  
 All Power Apps environments include the following solutions.
-	**Common Data Services Default Solution** - This is a base solution that is available for makers to use by default for their customizations in an environment.
-	**Default Solution** - This is a special solution that contains all customizations from all solutions in an environment. 
<!-- **Base Custom Controls Core** - This solution includes a core set of controls. Controls are used in user interface elements, such as fields, lists, and views. -->

Notice that if you have installed or imported other applications or solutions, additional solutions may be available in the solutions list. 

By default,  when you build or customize a model-driven app, you work with the solution called Common Data Services Default Solution. You can open the Common Data Services Default Solution to view and edit the components that are contained in it. To do this, follow these steps.
 
1.  On the left navigation pane select **Solutions**.

2.  In the list of solutions, select **Common Data Services Default Solution**.
  
> [!TIP]
>  If you plan to distribute the applications your make, consider changing the publisher customization prefix. More information: [Solution publisher prefix](change-solution-publisher-prefix.md).
