# Fields overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Fields define the individual data items that can be used to store information in an entity. Create new fields to capture data when existing standard entities donâ€™t have fields that meet your requirements. After you create a new field, be sure to include it on the appropriate forms and views for the entity so that they are available in your app.
