# Apply business logic in Common Data Service for Apps

Define *business rules* for an entity that apply to all the entity forms and at the server level. Business rules defined for an entity apply to both *canvas apps* and *model-driven apps* if the entity is used in the app. More information: [Create a business rule for an entity](data-platform-create-business-rule.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To define a business rule that applies to a form in a model-driven app, see [Create business rules for a model-driven app form](../model-driven-apps/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)

You can also use the classic Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps processes, which are workflows and actions. More information: [Microsoft Flow: Use Workflow processes](/flow/workflow-processes) and [Microsoft Flow: Actions overview](/flow/actions).
