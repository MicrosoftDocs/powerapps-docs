# Translate customized entity and field text into other languages

After you create customized entity and field text, you may want to translate it into other languages.  
  
1. Open [solution explorer](../model-driven-apps/advanced-navigation.md#solution-explorer).    
  
2. In the solution explorer, on the Actions toolbar, select **Export Translations**.  
3.  After completing the export, open or save the compressed (.zip) file that contains the exported labels to your local computer or network.  
  
4.  Extract the XML file from the compressed (.zip) file and translate it.
