# Translate customized entity and field text into other languages
After you create customized entity and field text in your unmanaged solution, you may want to translate it into other languages.  
  
1. Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and select **Solutions** from the left navigation.    
  
2. Select the solution you want, on the command bar select **…**, select **Translations**, and then select **Export translations**.  

3. After the export completes the exported translations compressed (zip) file is downloaded to your browser’s default download folder and contains the exported labels.
  
4. Extract the XML file from the compressed (.zip) file and translate it.
