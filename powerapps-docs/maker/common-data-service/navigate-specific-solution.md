# Navigate to a specific solution

If your organization already has a specific solution you should work in, this is how you can find it. To create a new solution, see [Create your own solution](create-solution.md).  
  
## Open an unmanaged solution  
  
1. Go to **[Settings](../model-driven-apps/advanced-navigation.md#settings)** > **Solutions**.  
  
2. Double-click the unmanaged solution that you want to work in to open it.  
  
 When you’re in the solution, you’ll see solution components. More information: [Add Solution Components](solutions-overview.md)  

 ## Next steps
[Monitor and manage workflow processes](/flow/monitor-manage-processes)
