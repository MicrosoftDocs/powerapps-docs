# Navigate to a specific solution

If your organization already has a specific solution you should work in, this is how you can find it. To create a new solution, see [Create your own solution](create-solution.md).  
  
## Open a solution  
  
1. Select **Solutions** from the left navigation to see a list of solutions in your environment.
  
2. Select the solution that you want to work in or view all the components contained within it. More information: [Add Components](solutions-overview.md)  

 ## Next steps
[Monitor and manage workflow processes](/flow/monitor-manage-processes)
