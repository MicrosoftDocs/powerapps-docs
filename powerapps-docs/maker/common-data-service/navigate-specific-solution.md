# Navigate to a specific solution

If your organization already has a specific solution you should work in, this is how you can find it.   
  
## Open a solution  
  
1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and then select **Solutions** from the left navigation to see a list of solutions in your environment.
  
2. Select the solution that you want to work in or view all the components contained within it.
