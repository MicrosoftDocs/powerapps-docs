# Explore Power Apps for free for 30 days

You can explore all the Power Apps capabilities for free by signing up for a 30-day Power Apps trial plan. If you don't have any license for Power Apps, the trial plan provides temporary access to do the following:

- Extend the capabilities of Office 365 (SharePoint Online, Teams, Excel, and more)
- Create and run canvas apps that connect to Microsoft Dataverse and a wide range of more than 200 other data sources, including premium connectors and on-premises data
- Create and run model-driven apps
- Create automated workflows with Power Automate
- Create and manage environments and Dataverse databases

If you have a Power Apps license or a license through Office 365, you already have access to some of these features. However, the trial license temporarily expands your access to include all features in the previous list. To find out what capabilities each type of license offers, see the [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

> [!NOTE]
> - If you're an administrator, see [Purchase Power Apps for your organization](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) or [Power Apps in your organization Q&A](../administrator/signup-question-and-answer.md).
> - Beginning January 2020, self-service purchase, subscription, and license management capabilities for Power Platform products (Power BI, Power Apps, and Power Automate) are available for commercial cloud customers in the United States. For more information, including steps to enable or disable self-service purchasing in your organization, see [Self-service purchase FAQ](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/self-service-purchase-faq).

### When will my trial license expire?

To determine when your trial license will expire, select the gear icon near the upper-right corner of the [Power Apps site](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Plan(s)**.
-->

### Does the cloud environment I use Power Apps in allow the use of trial licenses? 
Power Apps trial licenses are only available in the Azure commercial cloud. Power Apps trial licenses are not available in Azure Government or Microsoft Azure in China clouds.

### What happens when my trial expires?

You'll be prompted to request an extension of the trial or purchase a plan 30 days after the trial starts. You can find details about all plans on the [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

If you don't extend the trial or purchase a plan but you still have another kind of license, you can use all the features of Power Apps that your other license provides. Any data in Dataverse will remain as it is, and any app or flow that uses Dataverse will continue to run as it did if your license supports them. If you try to use premium Power Apps features but your existing license doesn't support them (for example, modify a schema or entities in Dataverse), you'll be prompted to purchase a plan.
