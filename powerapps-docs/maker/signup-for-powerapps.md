# Sign up for a free license to try PowerApps
To create an app in PowerApps, you need one of several types of licenses that offer different levels of functionality. You already have a license for PowerApps if your organization has purchased any of several versions of Office 365 or Dynamics 365 for you, or your organization purchased PowerApps Plan 1 or Plan 2 licenses for you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an administrator, see [Purchase PowerApps for your organization](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) or [PowerApps in your organization Q&A](../administrator/signup-question-and-answer.md).

You can find out [which licenses include PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/) and what they offer. If you're still not sure whether you already have a license, open the [PowerApps site](http://powerapps.microsoft.com), and then select **Sign in**.

![Sign-in option for PowerApps](./media/signup-for-powerapps/sign-in.png)

If you don't have a license or you want more functionality than what your current license offers, you can sign up for a free trial of PowerApps Plan 2. This license offers all PowerApps functionality but expires after 30 days.

## Upgrade an existing license 
You can start a a free, 30-day trial of PowerApps Plan 2 by signing into PowerApps with an existing license and then trying any of these features:

* [Create and manage an instance](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) of the Common Data Service.
* [Model your data](./common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md) using the Common Data Service.
* [Create and manage environments](../administrator/environments-administration.md) from the PowerApps admin center.
* [Manage an on-premises data gateway](./canvas-apps/gateway-management.md) in PowerApps.  

If you try any of these features without a PowerApps Plan 2 license, you'll be prompted to start your free, 30-day trial. Just select **Start my trial**, and then consent to the terms of use in the dialog box that appears.

![Agree to terms of use](./media/signup-for-powerapps/trial-consent.png)

## Get a license from scratch
If you don't have a license for PowerApps, you can sign up for a free, 30-day trial of PowerApps Plan 2 from the [PowerApps site](http://powerapps.microsoft.com).

* If you're using a browser on a phone, tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner, and then tap **Sign up free**.
* If you're using a browser on another type of device, select **Sign up free** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Sign up for free](./media/signup-for-powerapps/sign-up-browser.png)

Near the middle of the screen, select **Pricing**, and then select **Start free trial**.

![Start free trial](./media/signup-for-powerapps/start-free-trial.png)

In the dialog box that appears, type or paste your work or school email address, and then click or tap **Submit**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consumer email services, telecommunication providers, government, and military addresses aren't supported, including:  
> 
> * outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and so on  
> * .gov and .mil
>
> If you try to sign up with a personal email address, a message indicates that you must use a work or school email address.

![Type email address](./media/signup-for-powerapps/get-started-old.png)

If PowerApps recognizes your organization, you can sign in with your credentials for that organization (and skip the rest of these instructions).

![Sign in with work account](./media/signup-for-powerapps/we-know-you.png)

Otherwise, you're prompted to check your email. 

![Message to check email](./media/signup-for-powerapps/check-email.png)

In the email message, select the link to verify your email address, and (if prompted) provide more information.

When this dialog box appears, select **Start**, and then start to use [PowerApps](http://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc)!

![Click start](./media/signup-for-powerapps/almost-there.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want more time to evaluate PowerApps, you can request to extend your trial period for another 30 days.

## FAQ

### What premium features does the trial license include?

* **Access to the Common Data Service**, which is a secure business data platform built into PowerApps. The [Common Data Service](./common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md) comes with hundreds of standard business entities, so all your apps can share the same definition of “customer,” “product,” “lead,” and more.
* **Access to premium connections** such as Salesforce, DB2, Zendesk, and the Common Data Service. With many Office 365 and Dynamics 365 plans, you can connect to data sources such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, Dropbox, and Twitter. With the trial license, you can also connect to data through these premium connectors and many more:

    ![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/premium-connectors.png)

    In the [complete list of connectors](./canvas-apps/connections-list.md), premium connectors appear with a badge:

    ![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/premium-badge.png)
* **Access to the PowerApps admin center**, in which you can manage your environments, databases, user permissions, and data policies. [Learn more](../administrator/admin-guide.md)
* **Create apps in model-driven mode** in which you add components to an app and let PowerApps create its layout and other interface elements. 

For more information about functionality and capacity in the trial license, see the [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### What email address can I use?
You can use a work or school address to sign up for a trial license. If you use another kind of address, you might experience one of the symptoms in this table.

### What happens when my trial expires?
After 30 days, you'll be prompted to request an extension of the trial or purchase a plan. You can find details about all plans on the [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

* If you have access to PowerApps through Office 365, Dynamics 365, or a PowerApps Plan 1 license, you can still use PowerApps, but you might lose access to the Common Data Service, premium connectors, the PowerApps admin center, and other features of PowerApps Plan 2. For example, this screen might appear if you try to create a premium connection:

    ![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/premium-trial-expired.png)

* If your only access to PowerApps is through the trial (for which you signed up on the [PowerApps site](http://powerapps.microsoft.com/) or the [pricing page](http://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing)), you can request a 30-day extension of the trial license to retain access to PowerApps.

### When will my trial license expire?
To determine when your trial license will expire, select the gear icon near the upper-right corner of the [PowerApps site](http://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Plan(s)**.

![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/show-duration.png)

### What happens to my data if my trial license expires?
If you still have access to PowerApps, you can continue to use it. Any data in the Common Data Service will remain as it is, and any app or flow that used the Common Data Service as a data source will continue to run as it did. But you won't be able to use that app or flow, and you'll be prompted to request a 30-day extension of the trial or purchase a plan if you try to modify a schema or entities in the Common Data Service.

### What should I do next?
You can retain access to PowerApps and its features by doing either of the following:

* Extend your trial license for 30 days when prompted.
* Review the available plans on the PowerApps [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/), and then [purchase one](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md).
