# Getting Started with Dataverse and the Plan Designer

To use the Plan designer in Power Apps, follow these steps:

## Environment eligibility

1. **Dataverse Database Required:** Make sure your environment includes a Microsoft Dataverse database. If you need help adding one, see [Add a Dataverse table](power-platform/admin/create-database).
1. **Tenant-level setting enabled**
1. **Environment must be in an eligible locale**

## What If You Don’t Meet the Prerequisites?

1. **Developer Environment Option:**  
   If your current environment doesn’t meet the requirements but you can use developer environments, you’ll be automatically routed to your own developer environment. There, you’ll have permission to create Dataverse tables. Learn more in [Create a developer environment](power-platform/developer/create-developer-environment).
1. **No Developer Environment Available:**  
   If you can’t use or create a developer environment, you won’t be able to create plans in your current environment. In this case, switch to an environment where you have permission to create tables and start building your plan there.

## Who Can Access the Plan Designer?

The following security roles can see the Plan designer entry point on the Power Apps home page:

- **System admin**
- **System customizer:** Learn more about this (role) (/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)
- **Environment maker:** Environment makers are redirected to their own developer environment when they save tables.
