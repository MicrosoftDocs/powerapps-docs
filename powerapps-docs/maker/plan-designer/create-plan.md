# Create a plan using Plan designer

Use [Plan designer](plan-designer.md) to create user roles, data tables, and apps that address your business needs.

This article uses a sample scenario to show how Plan designer works by building a solution for managing paid time off (PTO) requests for employees and managers.

1. Access Plan designer from the Power Apps home page. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. Enter your prompt in the text box, like the example. Add context such as process diagrams, data models, or screenshots of legacy apps. When you're done, select **Enter**.

    ```copilot-prompt
    Employees need to log vacation days, and managers need to approve them.
    ```

Copilot opens Plan designer and analyzes your business scenario based on the description.

## Plan agents and copresence

In Plan designer, view the presence status of collaborators including plan agents. These AI assistants analyze your business problem and help generate a plan. 

- The **Requirement Agent** examines the business problem and uses AI to generate user requirements. This step is first step in the plan.
- The **Data Agent** suggests a set of tables for storing business information, complete with recommended columns, data types, and relationships.
- The **Solution Agent** evaluates the needs, processes, and data to create a solution that includes technologies such as apps, flows, and AI agents to address your business problem.

As the plan builds, review and edit the outputs generated by the agents.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/plan-agents.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plan designer showing the presence status of plan agents."::: 

### Copresence

Plan designer lets multiple authors use the same plan at the same time. The first author who enters the plan gets editing rights, and any author who joins later can only view the plan in read-only mode. You see other authors in the command bar, along with the agents in the plan. If you have read-only permissions, you can get editing rights after the author with editing permission exits the plan or after a period of inactivity. Plan designer supports up to 100 authors for copresence, but only one author can edit at a time. Multi-author coauthoring isn't supported.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Multiple users can't edit the plan at the same time.

## Generate user requirements

When Plan designer starts, the **Requirements Agent** identifies user needs based on your description.

In this scenario, two user roles are generated: the employee and the manager. Each user role includes a description and user needs. The user roles and needs appear in a bullet list and on the right side is a visual diagram.

1. Review the user roles and needs. Then, choose one of the following options:

   - Select **Looks good** to move to the next step and generate a data model.
   - Select **Edit** to make edits inline or add new user roles or needs.

     :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/requirements-generated.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plan designer showing user roles and stories. Options to edit or add roles are visible.":::

    **Making edits**  

    1. Inline editing provides these options:

        :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/inline-edit-requirements.png" alt-text="Screenshot of inline editing options for user roles and needs in Plan designer.":::

        Legend:

        a. Select and modify a user role.
        b. Add a new user role or delete the selected user role.  
        c. Add a new user need.  
        d. Add a new user need either at top of selected user need or after it, or delete the selected user need.  
        e. Add a new user role.

    1. Alternatively, use **Copilot** to provide feedback on the generated user needs.

        :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/inline-edit-copolit.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Copilot that gives feedback on user needs in Plan designer.":::

        To make changes, provide a brief description of what you want to modify. Here are examples of what to ask Copilot to do:

        - Add a user role for HR admin to monitor PTO across teams to manage payroll.
        - Add a user need for employees to view PTO blackout dates.
        - Remove the user need for managers for viewing vacation history of team members.

       Select **Keep** or **Review** to finalize your edits.

1. When you're done, select **Looks good** to proceed to the next step and generate data tables.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/looks-good-requirements.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plan designer with the 'Looks good' button to proceed to the next step.":::

## Generate data model

Next, the **Data Agent** suggests tables to store your business data.

1. Suggested data tables appear in the **Data model** section of the plan.

   - Select **Edit** and use Copilot to describe what you want to change or add.
   - Select **Show details** to view the data in a diagram, and edit it.
    
     :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/show-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the **Show details** button to view or edit data." lightbox="media/create-a-plan/show-details.png"::: 
   
1. If you select, **Show details** it opens the data workspace. Use the data workspace to create tables, set up relationships, and view a data diagram. For more information, see [Create and edit tables using Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-entities-portal#create-new-tables).

   :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/data-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the data workspace in Plan designer showing table relationships.":::

1. When you're done, select **Back**.

1. When you're ready to generate the technology proposal, select **Looks good** to continue.

## Generate technology proposal

The **Solution Agent** analyzes the plan and proposes technologies tailored to solve your business problem. In this scenario, a canvas app, a model-driven app, and a Power Automate flow are created. 

:::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/technology-proposed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plan designer that shows proposed technologies for the solution." lightbox="media/create-a-plan/technology-proposed.png":::

1. To view details of the proposed technologies, hover over the **information icon**. The pop-up info card shows the user roles being met and the data tables being used by the proposed technology.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/more-info-about-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Plan designer that shows details of proposed technologies.":::

2. Select **Looks good** to accept the proposed technologies, or select **Edit** to use Copilot and describe what you want to change.


### Proposed technologies

Plan designer suggests technologies from the following list:

- Apps like [canvas apps](../canvas-apps/getting-started.md) or [model-driven apps](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview.md)
- [Power Pages](/power-pages/introduction) websites
- [Power Automate](/power-automate/flow-types) flows  
- [Power BI Report](/power-bi/report-server/get-started)  
- [Copilot Studio Agents](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder)


## Save tables


To create objects such as apps, flows, sites, and agents, you need to save your plan and tables.

1. Select **Save tables**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/save-tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Save tables' button used to create objects.":::

1. Enter a solution name.
1. Choose a publisher or select an existing solution to contain the items generated from the plan, and then select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/save-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Save your plan' screen showing fields for solution name and publisher options.":::

    The plan is stored in a solution. This action enables the **Objects** view in Plan designer, so you can switch between the plan and the solution view without leaving Plan designer. Learn more about solutions in [Solution view](../data-platform/solutions-area.md).

1. Youâ€™re now ready to [build your solutions](build-solution.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-a-plan/create-objects.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the 'Ready to build your solution' message.":::

## Export your plan to PDF

Use the export to PDF feature to share plans with your stakeholders, to present ideas and requirements. It includes all details from the document side of the plan, except for diagrams. This feature enhances collaboration by enabling users to share user requirements, data models, and proposed data tables with leadership who may not have a Power Apps license.

To export a plan to PDF, on the top right selct **Print to PDF**.
