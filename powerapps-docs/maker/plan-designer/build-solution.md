# Build a solution from a plan

Build a solution based on the objects the Plan designer proposes for your business problem.

To follow this article, create and save a plan. Learn more in [create a plan](create-plan.md).

After saving a plan in a solution, create apps like canvas apps, model-driven apps, Power Automate flows, and Copilot Studio agents based on the solution proposal from the Plan designer.

## Create objects

1. Select **Create**.

1. When you select **Create** on one of these tiles, this happens:

    - **Canvas app**: Opens Power Apps Studio with a data-connected app that starts for you. The app includes responsive screens to view and edit data for each recommended table, and a welcome screen to navigate the app. Learn more about customizing screens in the [Add and navigate screens](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables#welcome-screen). Before using the app, [save and publish it](../canvas-apps/save-publish-app.md). 

    - **Model-driven app**: Opens the modern app designer with data tables already added. Before using the app, save and publish it.

    - **Power Automate flow**: Opens Power Automate with a prefilled prompt based on the business problem, user story, flow description, and data sources. To use the flow, save and publish it.
    
    - **Copilot Studio agents**: Opens Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS), where you finish creating your agent and then publish it. An agent is an AI-powered assistant that simplifies workflows, boosts productivity, and automates repetitive tasks. The plan designer includes agents as part of its recommended technologies. The plan prefills the agent with the following information:

        - **Name**: Name of the agent.  

        - **Description**: Details the purpose of the agent. 

        - **Instructions**: Provides a set of actions for the agent to take. 
 
        - **Knowledge**: All tables created by the plan are added to the agent as knowledge sources.  
 
        Review the instructions and update the agent as needed for your scenario. For example, add a trigger or an action to the agent. Test the agent to ensure it works as expected before publishing.

## Use existing app

When Plan designer proposes apps, you can add an existing app or replace a proposed app. This approach is helpful if you already have developed apps and want to use them in a new business solution. It saves time, reduces redundancy, and keeps your solutions consistent.

- To replace an app proposed in the plan, select **Replace** on the app tile you want to replace, and then select an app.

- To add an existing app that isn't related to the proposed scenarios, select **Add technology**, and then select an app.

    :::image type="content" source="media/build-your-solution/add-technology.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to add an existing app to the plan.":::

    Existing apps added to the plan aren't included in a new solution. Use the solution view to see all solutions related to the plan.
