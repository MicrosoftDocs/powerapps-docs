# Build a solution from a plan

Start building a solution based on the objects that Plan designer proposes for your business problem.

To follow this article, create and save a plan. Learn more about creating a plan in [Create a plan](create-plan.md).

After saving your plan to the solution, create apps like canvas apps, model-driven apps, Power Automate flows, and Copilot Studio agents based on the solution proposal from Plan designer.

## Create objects

1. Select **Create** to create the selected object.

2. When you select **Create** on one of these tiles, here's what happens:

    - **Canvas app**: Opens Power Apps Studio with a data-connected app that starts for you. The app includes responsive screens to view and edit data for each recommended table, and a welcome screen to navigate the app. Learn more about customizing screens in the [Add and navigate screens](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables#welcome-screen). Before using the app, [save and publish it](../canvas-apps/save-publish-app.md). 

    - **Model-driven app**: Opens the modern app designer with data tables already added. Save and publish the model-driven app to start using it.

    - **Power Automate flow**: Opens Power Automate with a prefilled prompt based on the business problem, user story, flow description, and data sources. Save and publish the flow to use it.
    
    - **Copilot Studio Agents**: Opens Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS), where you finish creating your agent and then publish it. An agent is an AI-powered assistant that simplifies workflows, enhances productivity, and automates repetitive tasks. The plan designer includes agents as part of its recommended technologies. The agent created by the plan is prefilled with the following information:

        - **Name**: Name of the agent.  

        - **Description**: Details the purpose of the agent. 

        - **Instructions**: Provides a set of actions for the agent to take. 
 
        - **Knowledge**: All tables created by the plan are added to the agent as knowledge sources.  
 
        Review the instructions and update the agent as needed for your scenario. For example, you might need to add a trigger or an action to the agent. Test the agent before publishing.

## Replace with an existing app

You can use existing apps in your plan. This saves time, reduces redundancy, and keeps your solutions consistent.

When new apps are proposed, you can replace them with existing apps. On the app tile, select **Replace**, and choose an existing app.
