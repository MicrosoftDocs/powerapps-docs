# Manage your solution

Solutions built with Plan designer promote healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) practices from the start, using Power Platform solutions. By packaging all plan components into a single solution artifact, makers can use advanced ALM capabilities to deploy their artifacts to target environments through managed solutions

When you create a plan, it is stored within a solution. This also enables the **Objects** view in Plan designer, letting makers switch between their plan and the solution view without leaving the designer.

A plan can be associated with multiple solutions. For example, if the maker adds an existing Dataverse table to the planâ€™s data model, the solutions associated with the Dataverse table also become associated with the plan.

The solutions associated with the plan are listed as tabs across the top of the **Objects** view screen. Makers can click between the tabs to view the objects of each solution. If there are more than 5 solutions, then an overflow menu will house the rest of the solutions.

All solution objects, not just the ones in the plan, are shown.

For more information about solutions, see [Solution view](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-area).
