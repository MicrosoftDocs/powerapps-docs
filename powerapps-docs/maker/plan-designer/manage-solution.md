# Manage your solution

Solutions built with Plan designer promote healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) practices from the start by using Power Platform solutions. By packaging all plan components into a single solution artifact, makers use advanced ALM capabilities to deploy their artifacts to target environments through managed solutions.

When you create a plan, it is stored within a solution, which enables the Objects view in Plan designer. This lets makers switch between their plan and the solution view without leaving Plan designer.

A plan can be associated with multiple solutions. For example, if you add an existing Dataverse table to the planâ€™s data model, the solutions linked to the Dataverse table also link to the plan.

The solutions associated with the plan are displayed as tabs across the top of the **Objects** view. Select a tab to view the objects in the solution. If there are more than five solutions, an overflow menu shows the remaining solutions. All solution objects are displayed, not just those included in the plan.
