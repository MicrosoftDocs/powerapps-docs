# Create a plan from a solution

Use Plan Designer to create a plan for your existing solution. Plan Designer provides a detailed document describing your solution. The plan includes a business problem, user requirements including user roles and stories, data model, and technology stack including apps and flows. This feature saves time previously spent deciphering a solutionâ€™s content and empowers makers to improve on an existing solution.

On the Solutions Page, click **Create plan from a solution**.

Select the solution that you would like to create a plan for. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The solution must have at least 1 app and 1 associated table.  

After selecting your solution, click **Create plan**.

After your plan has been created, save the plan. For an unmanaged solution, the plan will default to saving in the same solution. For a managed solution, the plan will default to saving in a new unmanaged solution.

Alternatively, you can select your solution on the solutions list and, in the overflow menu, click **Create a plan**.

## Known Limitations

1. A solution must have at least 1 app and 1 associated table to successfully create a plan.

2. The plan is able to recognize apps, flows, and tables in a solution. Other objects e.g., sites, agents are currently out of scope.

3. The apps in your solution must be published.

4. The solution must be published.
