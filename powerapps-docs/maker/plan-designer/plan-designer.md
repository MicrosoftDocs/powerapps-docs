# Use the Plan designer (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](../../../shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Learn how to use the Plan designer, a copilot-first development tool, to quickly create comprehensive business solutions. Describe your business problem in natural language and provide relevant images such as business process flows or screenshots of legacy apps. The Plan designer generates a complete Power Platform solution tailored to your needs, including Dataverse tables, canvas apps, model-driven apps, and suggested Power Automate flows. Follow the steps in this article to create a business solution and refine your requirements for precise and customized outputs.

Access the Plan designer from the Power Apps home page. It guides you through a multi-step process to generate user roles, user stories, data tables, and user experiences.

> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Prerequisite

On the Power Apps home page, turn on the **Try the new Power Apps experience** toggle. 

:::image type="content" source="media/pd-3-enable-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Apps home page with the new Copilot experience banner." :::


## Create a plan

To show you how the Plan designer works, let's use a sample scenario to build a solution for managing paid time off (PTO) requests for employees and managers.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the textbox, type **Employees need to log vacation days, and managers need to approve them**. You can also provide more context like process diagrams, data models, or screenshots of legacy apps. When you're done, press **Enter**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/pd-4-enter-sample-problem.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Plan designer with a sample scenario input." :::


Copilot opens the Plan designer and begins addressing your business scenario based on your description.


### Plan agents

Within the Plan designer, you can view the presence status of plan agents, which are AI assistants that analyze your business problem and generate a plan for it. These plan agents utilize AI to help build your plan.

- The **Requirement Agent** examines the business problem and uses AI to generate user requirements.
- The **Data Agent** suggests a set of tables for storing business information, complete with recommended columns, data types, and relationships.
- The **Solution Agent** evaluates the needs, processes, and data to create a solution that addresses your business problem.

Make sure to review and correct the outputs generated by the agents.

### Generate user needs

The Requirements Agent generates user needs based on your description.

In this scenario, two roles were generated: employee and manager. Each role comes with its own descriptions and user stories. On the left side, the user roles and stories are presented in a bullet list, while a visual diagram is shown on the right side.

:::image type="content" source="media/pd-6-generate-roles-stories.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the generated user roles and stories in the Plan designer." lightbox="media/pd-6-generate-roles-stories.png":::

1. Review the user roles and stories. Then, choose one of the following options:

    - Select **Add these roles** to generate a data model.
    - Select **Edit** to provide feedback for the generated user roles or stories. You can select a specific user role and enter your feedback.

1. If you need to make any changes, provide a brief description of what you want to modify. Here are examples of what you can ask Copilot to do:

    - Add a user role for HR admin to monitor PTO across teams to manage payroll.
    - Add a user story for employees to view PTO blackout dates.
    - Remove the user story for managers for viewing vacation history of team members.

1. Review the changes and select **Keep** or **Undo**. When you're done, select **Accept** to move on to the next step and generate data tables.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pd-7-keep-or-undo.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Plan designer showing updated user roles and stories." ::: 

### Generate data tables

1. The proposed data tables are listed in the **Data** section of the plan. Select **Show details** to view the data in a diagram.

      :::image type="content" source="media/pd-8-show-detailed-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the proposed data tables in the Plan designer." lightbox="media/pd-8-show-detailed-data.png":::

1. **Show details** opens the data workspace, where you can view the complete Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) containing all the generated tables. These Dataverse tables come with predefined columns and sample data. To see the specific details of a table, select **View data**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/pd-9-view-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the data workspace showing the ERD." lightbox="media/pd-9-view-data.png":::

      :::image type="content" source="media/pd-10-view-data-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the data workspace with table details." lightbox="media/pd-10-view-data-2.png":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During preview, the data workspace experience is read-only. The following items are not supported:
> - Editing tables or columns
> - Editing relationships between tables
> - Adding existing tables

### Edit tables

1. To modify the proposed tables, navigate back to the Plan designer and select **Edit**.

1. When you're ready to generate user experiences, select **Add these tables**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/pd-11-save-tables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Plan designer with the option to save tables." lightbox="media/pd-11-save-tables.png":::

### Generate user experiences

The Solution Agent proposes a set of user experiences tailored to solve your business problem. In this scenario, a canvas app, a model-driven app, and two Power Automate flows are created. These user experiences are designed for specified user roles and with data tables generated from the previous steps.

:::image type="content" source="media/pd-12-generate-user-exp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the proposed user experiences in the Plan designer." lightbox="media/pd-12-generate-user-exp.png":::

To view details of the proposed user experiences, hover over the **information icon**. The pop-up info card displays the name, description, targeted user role, and the included data tables.

:::image type="content" source="media/pd-13-more-info-about-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the information icon pop-up with user experience details." :::

To make changes, select **Edit** and follow the steps above. Or select **Add these user experiences** to create the assets.

Once you add the proposed user experiences, they're created.

### Save your plan and create items

1. To create an item such as canvas app or model-driven app, select **Create** > **Save all tables**.  

    Opening precreated Power Automate flows isn't supported; it navigates to the Power Automate page within your solution.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pd-14-open-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Plan designer with the option to open created apps.":::

1. Before creating your apps, you're promted to save your plan to a solution.

    1. Enter the plan name.
    1. Choose a publisher or select an existing solution that will contain the items generated from the plan.
    1. Select **Save**.
   
       :::image type="content" source="media/pd-save-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the save dialog box for a plan.":::

        The plan is stored within a solution. This action also enables the **Objects** view in the Plan designer, allowing makers to seamlessly switch between their plan and the solution view without leaving the Plan designer. For more information about solutions, see [Solution view](../data-platform/solutions-area.md).

        :::image type="content" source="media/pd-objects-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the objects view.":::

1. Once the plan is saved, select **Create** again. The proposed app open in a new tab, fully functioning with the added data tables.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pd-15-final-create.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting create to create your items.":::

For canvas apps, a preview of the app is displayed with a welcome screen and other screens connected to tables. When you open a model-driven app, it launches the modern app designer with the tables already added. Both canvas and model-driven apps can then be saved and published for use.

### Known limitations

The **Objects** view is currently in preview, and several functions that are native to the solution view don't work in the embedded Plan designer experience. 

Navigation Issues:

- When using the **Back** button after creating a new canvas app, model-driven app, Page, component library, or connection role, users are taken to the **All** section of **Objects** instead of their last location.
- After saving and exiting from the row summary, users are redirected to the **All** section of **Objects** rather than their previous location.
- Editing a table and then using the **Back** button also redirects users to the **All** section of **Objects** instead of their last location.
- Creating a new table and using the **Back** button takes users to the **All** section of **Objects** rather than their last location.
- When creating a new column security profile in apps, saving, and then using the **Back** button, the **Back** button doesn't work and results in continuous loading.
- Navigating to **Table** > **Forms**/**Views**/**Command** and then using the **Back** button redirects users to the **All** section of **Objects** instead of their last location.

## View and edit plans

When the Plan designer is turned on, you'll see the **Plans** menu in the left navigation pane. Use this menu to access your plans and make any necessary edits.
