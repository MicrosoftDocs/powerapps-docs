# Overview of Plan designer

Plan designer is a copilot-first development tool that lets you create comprehensive business solutions quickly. It lets you describe your business use case in natural language and add relevant images, such as business process flows or screenshots of legacy apps. The Plan Designer generates a complete Power Platform solution tailored to your needs. It includes Dataverse tables, canvas apps, model-driven apps, and Power Automate flows.
