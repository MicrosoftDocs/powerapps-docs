# Overview of Plan designer

Plan designer is a copilot-first development tool, to create comprehensive business solutions quickly. It lets you describe your business use case in natural language and provide relevant images, like business process flows or screenshots of legacy apps. The Plan designer generates a complete Power Platform solution tailored to your needs, including Dataverse tables, canvas apps, model-driven apps, and Power Automate flows.
