# Overview

Solutions built with Plan Designer promote healthy Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) practices from the start, using Microsoft Power Platform solutions. By packaging all Plan components into a single solution artifact, makers can leverage advanced ALM capabilities to deploy their artifacts to target environments through managed solutions.

When a plan is created, it is stored within a solution. This also enables the **Objects** view in Plan Designer, allowing makers to seamlessly switch between their plan and the solution view without leaving the designer.

A plan can be associated with multiple solutions. For example, if the maker adds an existing Dataverse table to the planâ€™s data model, then the solution(s) associated with the Dataverse table will also become associated with the plan.

Across the top of the Objects view screen, the solutions associated with the plan are listed as tabs. Makers can click between the tabs to view the objects of each solution. If there are more than 5 solutions, then an overflow menu will house the rest of the solutions.

> [!NOTE]  
> All the solution objects, not just the ones in the plan, are shown.

For more information about solutions, see [Solution view](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-area).
