# Power Apps Community Plan: a free development environment for individual use
If you want to build skills and learn more about Power Apps, Power Automate, and the Common Data Service, the Power Apps Community Plan is the right plan for you. The Power Apps Community Plan gives you a free development environment for individual use, where you can:

* Learn to build business apps and workflows with the full functionality of Power Apps and Power Automate.
* Connect to any data source by using our 100+ [out of the box connectors](./canvas-apps/connections-list.md) or by creating your own [custom connectors](./canvas-apps/register-custom-api.md).
* Explore how you can use [the Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction) to build powerful business apps with the common data model and [the SDK](https://aka.ms/eek20s).
* Export the solutions you create in your individual environment, and [list them on AppSource](./canvas-apps/dev-appsource-test-drive.md) so your customers can test-drive them.

## Who can sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan?
Anyone with a [work or school account](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq) can sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan. But we especially recommend this plan if you:

* Want to build skills and learn more about Power Apps, Power Automate, and the Common Data Service.
* Are interested in building business apps and workflows to distribute on AppSource.

## Where can I sign up for the Power Apps Community Plan?
Sign up on the [Power Apps Community Plan website](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan). If you are an existing user of Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, you can also [create an environment for individual use](https://make.powerapps.com/community/signup).

After signing up for the Community Plan, you will be redirected to the [Power Apps site](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and will land in your individual environment. The environment is named with your name, for example 'John Doe's environment'. If there is already an environment with that name, the individual environment will be named as 'John Doe's (1) environment'.  The following image shows how the environment appears.

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity of the individual environment, whether or not it's used, doesn't contribute to your company's overall quota.

## Publishing to AppSource
Do you have an app you would like to share with customers? We now support a Power Apps Test Drive solution on [AppSource.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com) as a way for you to share apps and flows with customers, and generate leads for your business. For more information, see [Let customers test drive your apps on AppSource](./canvas-apps/dev-appsource-test-drive.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if reach the capacity limits of the environment?

There is a limited capacity provided because this environment is meant for individual use, not for a team or production use. The capacity provided is:

| **Capacity** |  |
| --- | --- |
| Flow runs/month |750 |
| Database size |200 MB |
| File storage |2GB |

If you reach one or more capacity limits, we recommend you purchase a plan that supports production use. Learn more about our plans and their limits on the [Power Apps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### Can I transfer the apps, flows, and other resources created in the individual environment, to another environment?

Yes, you should be able to export the resources from this environment to other environments. For more information, see [Environment and tenant app migration](../administrator/environment-and-tenant-migration.md).

### Will my Power Apps Community Plan subscription ever expire?

You can use your Power Apps Community Plan subscription perpetually for free. If you are actively using an individual environment, then you won't lose access to any of the resources or functionality in that environment. You may, however, notice a delay when accessing your Common Data Service Database for the first time after a long period of inactivity.  This delay does not impact the data or entities stored in the Common Data Service.

### Can I get or create multiple individual environments?

No, you can only have one individual environment, which is created for you by Power Apps when you sign up for the Community Plan.

### What's the difference between Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Community Plan; and which one should I sign up for?

Both Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Community Plan are free, but are created for different purposes:

**Power Apps Plan Trial** gives you Power Apps Plan 2 for 30 days. This is meant for trying out Power Apps, Common Data Service, and Power Automate. Once your trial expires, you can purchase a plan. If you are already using Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, this is the right plan to try out the premium functionalities of Power Apps, which are available with Power Apps Per User Plan.

**Power Apps Community Plan** gives you access to Power Apps premium functionalities, Common Data Service, and Power Automate for individual use. This plan is primarily meant for learning purposes or creating business solutions to be distributed for [AppSource Test Drive](./canvas-apps/dev-appsource-test-drive.md). This plan is perpetually available, but only for learning and building your skills on Power Apps, Common Data Services, and Power Automate.

### Can I sign up with my personal account?

No, you can only sign up with your [work or school account](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq). We currently do not support signing up with a personal account.

### Can I delete my individual environment?

Tenant-level admins have the permissions needed to delete an individual environment through the user interface. An end user can delete an individual environment through a [Power Apps PowerShell admin cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#power-apps-cmdlets-for-administrators-preview).

```powershell
Remove-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName <environmentGuid>
```

### Can I reset my developer environment

Resetting a developer environment is not currently supported; however, it can be deleted. The next time the Community Plan licensed user signs into the Power Apps Maker portal a new developer environment will be created. The user can then provision a Common Database Service database in the environment. At present, the only way to remove the Community Plan from a user is for a tenant-level admin to block all "internal" consent plans in the tenant using PowerShell. See [Block trial licenses commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#block-trial-licenses-commands)
