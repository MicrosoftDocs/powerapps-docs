# Power Apps Developer Plan

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.

The plan enables you to:

- Create apps and flows without writing code, with full-featured Power Apps and Power Automate development tools. Easily share and collaborate on these solutions with others.

- Connect to any data source by using 400+ [out of the box connectors](canvas-apps/connections-list.md) or by creating your own [custom connectors](canvas-apps/register-custom-api.md).

- With [Dataverse](/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction), use a fully managed, scalable data platform, including support for common business app actions. Use out-of-the-box common tables or build your own data schema.

- Create more environments to exercise application lifecycle management (coming soon).

- Export the solutions you create in your individual environment, and [publish them on Microsoft AppSource](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource) so your customers can test-drive them.

## Improvements from the previous Power Apps Community Plan

In May 2021, we've extended the capabilities of the Power Apps Community Plan to meet the needs of developers and have rebranded it as the **Power Apps Developer Plan**.

Key changes include:

- Ability to share apps with team members for
development and testing purposes.
- Increased capability allocations.
- Ability to create more environments to support ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) scenarios (coming soon).

> [!NOTE]
> Existing Power Apps Community Plan users will also get all these updates.

## Who can sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?

Anyone with a [work or school email address](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq) can sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan.

## Where can I sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?

Sign up on the [Power Apps Developer Plan website](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsDevPlan). If you're an existing Power Apps user, you can also [create a developer environment](https://make.powerapps.com/community/signup).

After signing up for the Developer Plan, you'll be redirected to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). You
may need to select your developer environment in the top right of the screen. It will be shown with your name, for example "John Doe's environment'" If there's already an environment with that name, the individual environment will be named "John Doe's (1) environment". You'll need to use this developer environment, instead of your tenant’s default environment, to use certain capabilities such as premium and custom connectors.

## What are the capacity limits for the individual environment?

The following capacity limits apply for the individual environments.

| **Capacity**                                                    | **Limits** |
| - | - |
| Flow runs/month                                                 | 750        |
| Database size                                                   | 2 GB        |
|                                                                 |            |

You can't increase capacity by applying add-ons to the quantities that we include. If you hit capacity limits, we recommend purchasing Power Apps Per User Plan. Learn more about it from the [Power Apps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity entitlements of the developer environment, whether used or not, doesn't contribute to your company's overall quota.

## Publishing to Microsoft AppSource

Do you have an app you would like to share with customers? We now support Power Apps solutions on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) as a way for you to share apps and flows with customers, and generate leads for your
business. For more information, see [Publish your app on
AppSource](../developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What should I do if I reach the capacity limits of the environment?

There's a limited capacity provided because this environment is meant for development and test purposes, not for production use. The capacity limits are:

| **Capacity**                                                          | **Limits** |
| - | - |
| Flow runs/month                                                       | 750        |
| Database size                                                         | 2 GB       |

If you reach one or more capacity limits, we recommend you purchase a plan that
supports production use. Learn more about our plans on the [Power Apps pricing
page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### Can I transfer the apps, flows, and other resources created in the developer environment, to another environment?

Yes, you should be able to export the resources from this environment to other environments. For more information,
see [Solutions](data-platform/solutions-overview.md).

### Will my Power Apps Developer Plan subscription ever expire?

You can continue using your Power Apps Developer Plan for free as long as there's active usage and no abuse of the plan (for example, apps aren't used for production purposes, and the capacity limits aren't exceeded).

### Can I get or create multiple developer environments?

Currently, no. You can only have one developer environment, which is created for you by Power Apps when you sign up for the Developer Plan.

The ability to create more environments to support ALM scenarios is coming soon. Stay tuned for more details.

### What's the difference between Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan; and which one should I sign up for?

Both Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan are free, but are created for different purposes:

- **Power Apps Plan Trial** gives you the Power Apps per user plan for 30 days. This duration is meant for trying out production Power Apps applications. Once your trial
expires, you can purchase a plan. If you're already using Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, this is the right plan to try out the premium functionalities of Power Apps, which are available with paid Power Apps plans.

- **Power Apps Developer Plan** gives you perpetual access to the same Power Apps functionality available in paid plans (aligned with Trials), including Dataverse and Power Automate, but in a developer environment that is for development and test use only. A paid plan is required to deploy or run solutions in a production environment for production use.

### Can I sign up with my personal account?

No, you can only sign up with your [work or school
account](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq). We currently don't support signing up with a personal account.

### Can I delete my developer environment?

Tenant-level admins have the permissions needed to delete a developer environment through the user interface. An end user can delete a developer environment through a [Power Apps PowerShell admin cmdlet](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#power-apps-cmdlets-for-administrators-preview).

```powershell
Remove-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName <environmentGuid>
```

### Can I reset my developer environment?

Resetting a developer environment isn't currently supported; however, it can be deleted. A new developer environment will be created if the Developer Plan licensed user (who's environment is deleted) signs into the Power Apps maker portal again. The user can then provision a Dataverse database in the environment. Currently, the only way to remove the Developer Plan from a user is for a tenant-level admin to block all "internal" consent plans in the tenant using PowerShell. See [Block trial licenses commands](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#block-trial-licenses-commands)
