# Sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.

The plan enables you to:

- Create apps and flows without writing code, with full-featured Power Apps and Power Automate development tools. Easily share and collaborate on these solutions with others.

- Connect to any data source by using 400+ [out of the box connectors](canvas-apps/connections-list.md) or by creating your own [custom connectors](canvas-apps/register-custom-api.md).

- Use a fully managed, scalable data platform with [Dataverse](/common-data-service/entity-reference/introduction), including support for common business application actions. Use out-of-the-box common tables or build your own data schema.

- Export the solutions you create in your developer environment, and [publish them on Microsoft AppSource](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource) so your customers can test-drive them.

## Improvements from the previous Power Apps Community Plan

In May 2021, we extended the capabilities of the Power Apps Community Plan to meet the needs of developers and rebranded it as the **Power Apps Developer Plan**.

Key changes include:

- The ability to share apps with team members for development and testing purposes
- Increased capacity allocations

> [!NOTE]
> Existing Power Apps Community Plan users will also get all of these updates.

## Who can sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?

Anyone with a [work or school email address](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq) backed by [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization) can sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan.

## Where can I sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan?

Sign up on the [Power Apps Developer Plan website](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsDevPlan). 

After signing up for the Developer Plan, you'll be redirected to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). You may need to select your developer environment from the top-right corner of the screen. The environment will be shown with your name, for example "John Doe's environment." If there's already an environment with that name, the developer new environment will be named "John Doe's (1) environment."

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a couple of minutes for the new environment to be provisioned and become available in the list of the environments. You can see the progress of the environment creation in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com).

Use this developer environment instead of your tenant’s default environment to work with certain capabilities such as premium and custom connectors.

## What are the capacity limits for the developer environment?

The following capacity limits apply to the developer environments:

| **Capacity**                                                    | **Limits** |
| - | - |
| Flow runs/month                                                 | 750        |
| Database size                                                   | 2 GB        |
|                                                                 |            |

You can't increase capacity by applying add-ons to the quantities we include. If you hit capacity limits, we recommend purchasing the Power Apps Per User Plan. Learn more from the [Power Apps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

> [!NOTE]
> The capacity entitlements of the developer environment, whether used or not, doesn't contribute to your company's overall quota.

## Publishing to Microsoft AppSource

Do you have an app that you'd like to share with customers? We now support Power Apps solutions on [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) as a way for you to share apps and flows with customers, and generate leads for your
business. For more information, see [Publish your app on
AppSource](../developer/data-platform/publish-app-appsource.md).

## FAQ

The following section lists frequently asked questions relevant to the Power Apps Developer Plan. For more information about different types of environments including the developer environment, see [Types of environments in Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview#types-of-environments).

### What should I do if I reach the capacity limits of the environment?

There's a limited capacity provided because this environment is meant for development and test purposes, not for production use. The capacity limits are:

| **Capacity**                                                          | **Limits** |
| - | - |
| Flow runs/month                                                       | 750        |
| Database size                                                         | 2 GB       |

If you reach one or more capacity limits, we recommend you purchase a plan that
supports production use. Learn more about our plans on the [Power Apps pricing
page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).

### Can I transfer the apps, flows, and other resources created in the developer environment to another environment?

Yes, you should be able to export the resources from this environment to other environments. For more information,
see [Solutions](data-platform/solutions-overview.md).

### Will my Power Apps Developer Plan subscription ever expire?

You can continue using your Power Apps Developer Plan for free as long as there's active usage and no abuse of the plan (for example, apps aren't used for production purposes and the capacity limits aren't exceeded). Environments created using Power Apps Developer Plan that are inactive for the last 90 days will be deleted after notifying the environment owners.

### Can I get or create multiple developer environments?

Currently, no. You can only have one developer environment, which is created for you by Power Apps when you sign up for the Developer Plan.

### What's the difference between the Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan? Which one should I sign up for?

Both Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Developer Plan are free, but are created for different purposes:

- **Power Apps Plan Trial** gives you the Power Apps per user plan for 30 days. This duration is meant for trying out production Power Apps applications. Once your trial
expires, you can purchase a plan. If you're already using Power Apps with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, this is the right plan to test the premium functionalities of Power Apps, which are available with paid Power Apps plans.

- **Power Apps Developer Plan** gives you access to the same Power Apps functionality available in paid plans (aligned with Trials), including Dataverse and Power Automate, but in a developer environment meant for development and test use only. A paid plan is required to deploy or run solutions in a production environment for production use.

### Can I sign up with my personal account?

No, we currently don't support signing up with a personal account. You can only sign up with your [work or school
account](signup-for-powerapps.md#faq).

### Can I reset or delete my developer environment?

Resetting a developer environment isn't currently supported; however, it can be deleted. The owner of the developer environment, or users with the [permission to delete an environment](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant#service-administrator-permission-matrix) can delete a developer environment.

However, even after deleting a user's developer environment, a new developer environment will be created when the user signs into Power Apps maker portal again&mdash;as long as the user continues to have the **Microsoft Power Apps for Developer** license. The user can then provision a Dataverse database in the new developer environment.

To remove the Developer Plan capability from a user permanently, a member of the Power Platform related [service admin roles](/power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant) must perform the following actions:

- Remove the **Microsoft Power Apps for Developer** license. For more information, see  [Service plan IDs for licensing](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-service-plan-reference).
- Disable [self-service sign-up](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup).
- Explicitly block all "internal" consent plans in the tenant using PowerShell. For more information, see [Block trial licenses commands](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell#block-trial-licenses-commands).

### Does the Power Apps Developer plan include Power Automate RPA use rights?
No. However, users may start a Power Automate trial including RPA use rights to try out RPA capabilities. Power Apps Developer plan includes cloud flow use rights since these can be connected to an act as an extension of Power Apps apps.

### Does the Power Apps Developer plan include AI Builder use rights? 
No. However, users may start an AI Builder trial to try out the AI Builder capabilities.

### Why does a banner appear with apps running in the developer environment?
Since developer environments aren't intended to support production scenarios, apps display a temporary banner to remind makers about them running in a developer environment. This banner will no longer appear if you move the app from a developer environment to a non-developer environment.

:::image type="content" source="media/developer-plan/power_apps_dev_env_app_banner.png" alt-text="Power Apps Developer Environment app banner.":::

### Are Dynamics 365 apps available in a developer environment?
No. Dynamics 365 apps can't be installed in a developer environment. You'll see the following message when you try to install them:

"Installing Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service is only supported on environments that have been created with a database with the option to Enable Dynamics 365 apps set to “Yes”. Try installing this application in an environment with a database and Enable Dynamics 365 apps enabled on it."

If you want to explore Dynamics 365 apps, refer to the app-specific documentation for free trials, or to install them on existing environments.
