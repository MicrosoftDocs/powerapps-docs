# Advanced monitoring concepts

In this article, you'll learn about downloading and uploading trace files in Monitor, events supported by Monitor, and scenarios that Monitor doesn't support.

## Download and upload trace files

You can download the events listed in [Supported events](#supported-events) for offline analysis.
Events can be downloaded in .json or .csv format, and you can share them with
others. The .csv files can only be downloaded, not uploaded, but if you download the events
in .json format, you can upload them later into Monitor for analysis. You can
also attach a trace file to support service requests, which can help speed up getting the solution to your problem.

Select **Upload** to load a .json trace file to Monitor. This option removes any events currently displayed in the Monitor table and replaces the details with events contained in the trace file.
