# Debug a model-driven app with Monitor

Monitor can help you debug and diagnose problems and help you build faster, more reliable apps. Monitor provides a deep view into how an app runs by providing a log of all key activities in your app as the app runs.

For more information about when you should monitor an app, see [Monitor overview](monitor-overview.md). To run Monitor with a canvas app, see [Debugging canvas apps with Monitor](monitor-canvasapps.md).

## Use Monitor to diagnose a model-driven app

1. Sign into Power Apps, and then select **Apps** from the left navigation pane.
1. Select the model-driven app that you want to monitor, and then select **Monitor** on the command bar.
1. In the web page that opens, select **Play model-driven app** to open your app.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Alternatively, you can run a model-driven app and add “&monitor=true” to the end of the URL in the browser. Then, select **Monitor** on the command bar to start a monitoring session in a new tab.

1. After the app is opened from Monitor, you’ll see a **Join monitor debug session?** dialog box. This lets you know that any data from the app will be sent to the Monitor owner. Select **Join**. Events begin to flow to the Monitor session screen as they occur in the app.

1. Select an event to display additional information in the right pane.

## Events monitored

Page navigation, command executions, form saves, and other major actions will send key performance indicators and network events to Monitor.

### FullLoad

FullLoad signifies the complete load of a page navigation, such as an edit form load. This event waits for certain network requests to complete and all rendering to finish, so the form can be ready before FullLoad completes.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-fullload.png" alt-text="Fullload event":::

Select a FullLoad event to display the **Details** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-fullload-details.png" alt-text="Fulload event details":::

The FullLoad event captures many statistics about the page load.  You can see the task edit form loaded in 506 ms, and selecting the row reveals information in the property pane. You can see details on `customScriptTime` (time spent execute custom JavaScript), `loadType` (0 = first-time loading page type, 1 = first time loading entity, 2  = first-time loading record, 3 = exact record has been visited), and `FormId` (form identifier for further diagnosis).  Expanding **Attribution** gives a breakdown of custom JS execution time by type, publisher, solution, version, web resource, and method.  This can help identify bottlenecks in form load time.

### Network

The **Network** events reveal details about each request made from the app.

Select a Network event to display the **Details** tab.

Earlier you learned about Monitor and how to use it to model-driven apps. Let’s look at a few scenarios where Monitor can assist you in solving script errors, unexpected behavior, and slowdowns.

## Custom script errors

Sometimes, a bug in the custom JS causes a script error or functionality
problem when loading a page. While this usually produces a call stack in the
dialog, it’s hard to always know where it’s coming from or decode the error.
Monitor receives events from the app with more details about the errors, so you can debug more quickly, and easily.

For example, imagine a user is experiencing a script error dialog on account form load.  You can use Monitor to get more details on the event.  Once the scenario is reproduced, you can see the script error produces an error event highlighted in red. Selecting this row gives you not only the **call stack** but
the **publisher name**, **solution name/version**, **web resource name**,
and **type** (such as *onload*, *onchange*, *RuleEvaluation*, and *CustomControl*). In this example, it looks like a typo in the script.

## Slow performance

Browser developer tools can help profile slow page loads, but there is many data to filter though and it’s not clear what is important to look at. Monitor solves this problem by showing relevant events that contribute to page load performance.

For example, imagine a user is experiencing slow account form loads, and the browser is
constantly freezing up. In this case, after you reproduce the issue, you can see a performance warning telling you that a synchronous **XMLHttpRequest** was sent during the load which degraded performance.

![Slow performance example](media/monitor/slow-perf-example.png "Slow performance example")

See [previous blog post](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/turbocharge-your-model-driven-apps-by-transitioning-away-from-synchronous-requests/) for how to alleviate synchronous XMLHttpRequest (XHR) performance problems.

For every page load, the data platform sends all KPI for the loading sequence as well as network request details as mentioned earlier.
