summary: |
  Frequently asked questions about the **wrap** feature are listed below.

sections:
  - name: General
    questions:    
      - question: |
          Can single tenant customers use wrap with Power Apps? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Both single tenant and multitenant customers can use wrap. However, it's important to assign a correct account type for your app on Azure portal if you're creating a new app registration manually. See [App registration](wrap-how-to.md#aegistering your app on Azure portal manually) for directions on how to select a correct account type to prepare your app for wrap.

      - question: |
          Does the wrap feature in Power Apps support Customer Managed Keys (CMK) or Lockbox capabilities?
        answer: |
          No. The wrap feature in Power Apps doesn't  support Customer Managed Keys (CMK) or Lockbox capabilities. Wrap for Power Apps uses Azure DevOps build pipelines to build mobile apps. Customer assets may be exposed in the build pipeline to Microsoft service operators. 

      - question: |
          Can I create mobile apps with Power Apps?
        answer: |
          Yes. More information: [Creating mobile apps with Power Apps](overview.md)

      - question: |
          If I create a mobile app with Power Apps, does Microsoft release it for me?
        answer: |
          No. Microsoft wraps your app in a native mobile app shell for you to digitally sign and distribute.

      - question: |
          How do I digitally sign my mobile app?
        answer: |
          You can automatically sign your mobile app package in **Step 2: Target Platforms** step in wrap wizard. You will need to [create and prepare your Azure Key Vault](create-key-vault-for-code-signing.md) to take advantage of automatic mobile app signing feature in wrap wizard. For information on how to code sign your app manually, see instructions here: [Android](code-sign-android.md), [iOS](code-sign-ios.md) and [Google Play Store](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).
          
      - question: |
          Can I use Xcode to digitally sign my mobile apps for iOS?
        answer: |
          No. Signing your mobile app with Xcode isn't supported in wrap. To digitally sign your wrapped mobile app package for iOS, see [Code sign for iOS](code-sign-ios.md).

      - question: |
          How do I distribute my mobile app?
        answer: |
          It depends on your business scenario. You can use [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune), [Microsoft App Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/), [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/work/answer/6138458) or [Apple Business Manager](https://developer.apple.com/custom-apps/). 

      - question: |
          How do I configure my mobile app for distribution through Microsoft Intune?
        answer: |
          Wrap wizard automatically configures your app for distribution with [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune). To troubleshoot, you can manually grant all the canvas app(s) that you intend to wrap *Microsoft Mobile Application Management* API permission manually. More information:    [Configure the API permissions for your app manually](wrap-how-to.md#configure-the-api-permissions-for-your-app-manually-optional).

      - question: |
          Do I need to rewrap and redistribute my mobile app frequently?
        answer: |
          Power Apps Mobile is [updated periodically](/power-platform/released-versions/powerapps#all-power-apps-studio-and-power-apps-mobile-versions). Hence, to ensure compatibility with the latest Power Apps release versions, benefit from bug-fixes and new platform features, we recommend that you rewrap and redistribute your mobile app to your end users at least on a monthly basis.

      - question: |
          Do I need to rewrap and redistribute my mobile app after making changes to the canvas app(s) included in the package?
        answer: |
          No. Published changes to the included canvas app(s) are downloaded automatically by existing, released versions of your mobile app. However, we recommend that you rewrap and redistribute your mobile app on a [monthly basis](faq.yml#do-i-need-to-rewrap-and-redistribute-my-mobile-app-frequently-) to benefit from platform bug fixes, updates and new features.
          
      - question: |
         How do I update the icons and colors in my mobile app?
        answer: |
         You can update icons and colors in your mobile app by rewraping your apps with new icons and colors and redistributing the updated mobile app package.
         
      - question: |
         How do I add or remove canvas apps in my wrapped mobile app?
        answer: |
         You can add or remove canvas apps by rewraping your mobile app package with a new set of included apps and redistributing your mobile package.
          
      - question: |
          What are Primary and Secondary apps in the context of wrap?
        answer: |
          Primary app provides the main experience of your mobile app. Secondary apps are bundled for performance reasons and must be linked from your primary app. See [wrap multiple canvas apps together](overview.md#wrap-multiple-canvas-apps-together).

      - question: |
          What are the advantages of including Secondary apps in the bundle, if I can still Launch() them without doing so?
        answer: |
          Including Secondary apps in the bundle provides a better Launch time performance when opening them for the first time. However, it's entirely optional to bundle Secondary apps with the Primary app. If you have many Secondary apps, you may choose to not bundle them to reduce the total size of the app bundle.

      - question: |
          Can I add apps that use Power BI data to wrap?
        answer: |
          Yes. Wrap wizard automatically configures your mobile app to be able to use Power BI. To troubleshoot, you can manually grant *Power BI* API permission to all your apps that use Power BI data. More information: [Configure the API permissions for your app manually](wrap-how-to.md#configure-the-api-permissions-for-your-app-manually-optional)
        
      - question: |
          Can I deep link into a wrapped mobile app?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can use ```ms-mobile-apps:///providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apps/<appID>?tenantId=<tenantId>``` schema to deep link into your wrapped mobile apps. Refer to [Using deep links with wrapped mobile apps](wrap-deep-links.md) for more information.
          
      - question: |
          Why do I see this error message when I try to open my wrapped native app on a mobile device: You can't get there from here error message 
        answer: |
         Your organization might have **Require Approved Client App** conditional access policy that restricts access to mobile apps. To fix this issue see, [Edit your conditional access policy](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/migrate-approved-client-app#edit-an-existing-conditional-access-policy).
                
      - question: |
          Can I create B2C mobile apps with Power Apps?
        answer: |
          No. Power Apps is a platform for creating business applications and uses Microsoft Entra authentication. The wrap feature wraps existing canvas apps for the same set of end users.
