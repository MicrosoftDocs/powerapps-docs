      - question: |
          Can single tenant customers use wrap with Power Apps? 
        answer: |
          Yes. Both single tenant and multitenant customers can use wrap. However, it is important to assign a correct account type for your app on Azure portal during new app registration. See [App registration](how-to.md#app-registration) for directions on how to select a correct account type to prepare your app for wrap.

      - question: |
          Does the wrap feature in Power Apps support Customer Managed Keys (CMK) or Lockbox capabilities?
        answer: |
          No. The wrap feature in Power Apps does not support Customer Managed Keys (CMK) or Lockbox capabilities. Wrap for Power Apps uses Azure DevOps build pipelines to build mobile apps. Customer assets may be exposed in the build pipeline to Microsoft service operators. 

      - question: |
          Can I create mobile apps with Power Apps?
        answer: |
          Yes. More information: [Creating mobile apps with Power Apps](overview.md)

      - question: |
          If I create a mobile app with Power Apps, does Microsoft release it for me?
        answer: |
          No. Microsoft will wrap your Power Apps app in a native mobile app shell for you to digitally sign and distribute.

      - question: |
          How do I digitally sign my mobile app?
        answer: |
          Signing instructions are provided for [Android](code-sign-android.md) and [iOS](code-sign-ios.md).

      - question: |
          How do I distribute my mobile app?
        answer: |
          It depends on your business scenario. You can use [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune), [Microsoft App Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/), [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/work/answer/6138458) or [Apple Business Manager](https://developer.apple.com/custom-apps/). 

      - question: |
          How do I configure my mobile app for distribution through Microsoft Intune?
        answer: |
          To enable your wrapped app package for distribution using [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune), you need to grant all the canvas app(s) that you intend to wrap *Mobile Application Management* API permission during the [App Registration](how-to.md#app-registration) step. More information: [Configure API permissions](how-to.md#configure-api-permissions).

      - question: |
          Do I need to rewrap and redistribute my mobile app frequently?
        answer: |
          Power Apps Mobile is [updated periodically](/power-platform/released-versions/powerapps#all-power-apps-studio-and-power-apps-mobile-versions). Hence, to ensure compatibility with the latest Power Apps release versions, benefit from bug-fixes and new platform features, we recommend that you rewrap and redistribute your mobile app to your end users at least on a monthly basis.

      - question: |
          Do I need to rewrap and redistribute my mobile app after making changes to the canvas app(s) included in the package?
        answer: |
          No. Published changes to the included canvas app(s) are downloaded automatically by existing, released versions of your mobile app. However, we recommend that you rewrap and redistribute your mobile app on a [monthly basis](faq.yml#do-i-need-to-rewrap-and-redistribute-my-mobile-app-frequently-) to benefit from platform bug fixes, updates and new features.
          
      - question: |
         How do I update the icons and colors in my mobile app?
        answer: |
         You can update icons and colors in your mobile app by rewraping your apps with new icons and colors and redistributing the updated mobile app pacakge.
         
      - question: |
         How do I add or remove canvas apps in my wrapped mobile app?
        answer: |
         You can add or remove canvas apps by rewraping your mobile app package with a new set of included apps and redistributing your mobile package.
          
      - question: |
          What are Primary and Secondary apps in the context of wrap?
        answer: |
          Primary app provides the main experience of your mobile app. Secondary apps are bundled for performance reasons and must be linked from your primary app. See [wrap multiple canvas apps together](overview.md#wrap-multiple-canvas-apps-together).

      - question: |
          What are the advantages of including Secondary apps in the bundle, if I can still Launch() them without doing so?
        answer: |
          Including Secondary apps in the bundle provides a better Launch time performance when opening them for the first time. Howver, it is entirely optional to bundle Secondary apps with the Primary app. If you have many Secondary apps, you may choose to not bundle them to reduce the total size of the app bundle.

      - question: |
          Can I add apps that use Power BI data to wrap?
        answer: |
          Yes. However, you need to grant *Power BI* API permission to all your apps that use Power BI data during the [App Registration](how-to.md#app-registration) step. More information: [Configure API permissions](how-to.md#configure-api-permissions).
          

      - question: |
          Can I create B2C mobile apps with Power Apps?
        answer: |
          No. Power Apps is a platform for creating business applications and uses Azure Active Directory authentication. The wrap feature wraps existing canvas apps for the same set of end users.
