# Get help building your app from a virtual agent

Get contextual help while building your app using the Power Platform virtual agent. The virtual agent is available to answer questions about common scenarios when you're building an app. The virtual agent helps you by providing access to help content from documentation, the community, and blogs.

You can connect to a virtual agent from the following areas:

- [Power Apps Studio](../canvas-apps/power-apps-studio.md)

When the left navigation menu is expanded the **Ask a virtual agent** button looks like this: ![Ask a virtual agent expanded menu.](media/bot/virtual-agent-expanded.png "Ask a virtual agent button in its expanded state")
