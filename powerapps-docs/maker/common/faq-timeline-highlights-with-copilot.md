# Responsible AI FAQ for Copilot in the timeline

Here are some common questions and answers about using Copilot in the timeline. 

## What is Copilot in the timeline? 

Copilot is a feature that uses AI to generate highlights based on timeline activities. 

## How does Copilot work? 

Copilot uses advanced language models to generate content suggestions that refer to the activities in the timeline and generate highlights. Timeline highlights show details from activities such as notes, emails, tasks, appointments, phone calls, and conversations. 

## What can I use Copilot for? 

You can use Copilot for various scenarios where you need to communicate with your customers effectively. For example, you can use Copilot to: 

- Summarize activities in the timeline. 

- Shorthand catchup on activities in the timeline for entities, such as Case, Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and other custom entities where the timeline is available. 

- Save time and energy by using ready-made activity highlights. 

## How do I use Copilot? 

Using Copilot is easy and intuitive. 

To use Copilot in the timeline: 

1. Select the chevron in the **Timeline highlights** section, and then wait for Copilot to generate highlights based on activities in the timeline.

   1. Edit the highlights before reusing them: Select **Copy**, and then paste the highlights into a note and edit them as needed. You can change the wording, add details, or delete parts of the content. Make sure the content is accurate, relevant, and appropriate for your customers.
   2. Reuse the highlights as-is: Select **Copy**, and then paste the highlights in notes or wherever you want to share them.
1. Send the content to your collaborators.

## How did you evaluate Copilot?

- Diversity: How well the generated highlights offer different options and perspectives 

- Readability: How easy the generated highlights are to read and understand 

## What are the limitations of Copilot in the timeline? 

- Copilot is a powerful and helpful feature, but it isn't perfect. It has some limitations that you should be aware of and respect. These limitations include: 

- Language: Copilot only supports the English language for now. If you need to write in another language, you can't use Copilot. 

- Suggestions: Copilot only provides suggestions, not final content. You're responsible for reviewing and editing the content before you send it to your customers. You shouldn't rely on Copilot to write your content for you. 

- Ethics: Copilot is designed to help you create ethical and responsible content. However, Copilot may not be able to detect or prevent offensive, harmful, or misleading content. You should always use your own judgment and follow your company's policies and values when using Copilot. 

## Are there any settings I should change for effective and responsible use of Copilot in the timeline? 

- Copilot in the timeline doesn't provide a way to change its behavior. Timeline highlights are generated based on the activities in timeline such as notes, emails, tasks, phone calls, appointments, and conversations. 

Always review and edit Copilot's suggestions before sending them to your collaborators.
