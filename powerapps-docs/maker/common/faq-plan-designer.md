# FAQ for the Plan designer 

## What is the Plan designer?

The Plan Designer is an AI-powered experience that builds an end-to-end business solution in a matter of minutes. By describing a business problem in natural language, and including images such as a legacy app, process diagram, you can expect an outline of user roles and requirements; more importantly, an end-to-end Power Platform solution generated with objects like Dataverse tables, Power Apps (canvas and model-driven apps), and Power Automate flows. In the Plan designer, you can continuously iterate and refine your business requirements to produce a more precise output tailored to your specific needs.
