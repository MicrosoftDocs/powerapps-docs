# FAQ on filtering, sorting, and searching Power Apps galleries with Copilot

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI effect of filtering, sorting, and searching Power Apps canvas galleries with Copilot.

## What is filtering, sorting, and searching with Copilot?

Filtering, sorting, and searching with Copilot is a feature for users of Power Apps who want to filter their galleries using natural language. It surfaces in galleries of canvas apps that use SharePoint as their backend. There are plans to expand to other data sources in the future.

## What are the system’s capabilities?

It takes the user's input and uses advanced language models to filter, sort, and search the gallery. The user can then add more filters, view and remove current filters, or accept to persist the filtered view.

## What is the system’s intended use?

As an AI assistant to users, it filters the gallery based on the user's input.

## How was filtering, sorting, and searching with Copilot evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We evaluate the feature both qualitatively and quantitatively. To assess the quality of the feature, we're conducting studies with users to gather feedback on their experiences, thoughts about the feature's quality, and suggestions for improvement.
