# AI plugins in Power Platform (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The AI plugins leverage Power Platform components like flows, connectors or prompts to define a specific business behavior which can be added to a Copilot. The Copilot will use the appropriate plugin able to address the questions of an end user in the application. You can use [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) to view and create AI plugins for use across Power Platform and Microsoft 365. 

With AI plugins, makers can build capabilities enabling Copilot to answer questions they wouldnâ€™t be able to tackle by default or to enhance out-of-the-box answers.

Use [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) to create AI plugins. You can also go to [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-plugins-overview) to create AI plugins for use across Power Platform.

|Open AI plugins       | Open AI plugins provide access to data sources, allowing specific data to be surfaced through AI experiences that would not normally be available through general models. [Learn more](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction) |
|Power Automate flow plugins     | Power Automate flows allow defining custom automations. These kinds of plugins are appropriate when a Maker wants to perform several actions which are not only about accessing data or generating content. [Learn more](/power-automate) |
