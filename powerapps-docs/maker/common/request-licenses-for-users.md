# Request Power Apps licenses for your app users

As a Power Apps maker, you can create an app that requires a license for use. For example, if you create an app with premium components or connectors, users must have an appropriate Power Apps license to use it. 

When you share a [canvas app](../canvas-apps/share-app.md) or [model-driven app](../model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app.md) that contains premium components, select **Request licenses**. The request is submitted to your admin for approval. You can't request licenses for security groups or distribution lists.

After your [admin has reviewed your request](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), you'll receive an email notification indicating whether the request was approved or denied.
