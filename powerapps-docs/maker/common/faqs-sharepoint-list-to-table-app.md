# FAQ for SharePoint List to table and app

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of the SharePoint List to table and app feature.

## What is SharePoint List to table and app? 

SharePoint List to table and app allows makers to bring their own SharePoint List and convert that to a Dataverse table and an app along with it. The feature accepts a SharePoint List and produces a Dataverse table as the output. When a maker uses the feature from the home page or the Apps area, it can also generate an app based on the Dataverse table. When Copilot is enabled in the current environment, it leverages  Azure OpenAI Service to generate the best-fitting table and column metadata based on the selected SharePoint List. 

## What can SharePoint List to table and app do? 

SharePoint List to table and app converts the selected SharePoint List to a Dataverse table by generating column metadata and ingesting data from the SharePoint List to the created Dataverse table. When Copilot capability is enabled in this environment, Copilot assists with the table creation by generating column descriptions and data types based on the selected SharePoint List. Copilot will not read all of the customer data to generate the metadata. Copilot will not change any of the customer data from the original source.  

## What is/are SharePoint List to table and app’s intended use(s)? 

SharePoint List to table and app is intended to assist makers to migrate their existing data from SharePoint List into Power Platform. It ensures new or less experienced makers can move away from their existing SharePoint based system to Dataverse tables and be put in the position of having a working app connected to that data so they can understand how apps in Power Apps are built. 

## How was SharePoint List to table and app evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

We have set up reports and dashboards to track the usage, net promoter score (NPS), and engagement of the feature. We have also set up monitors to track the success rate of table creation, data ingestion, and AI inference. Top errors that occur to the users are logged as part of our monitors to help us understand what’s causing the issues. 

## What are the limitations of SharePoint List to table and app? How can users minimize the impact of SharePoint List to table and app’s limitations when using the system? 

When Copilot is enabled for the environment, SharePoint List to table and app will produce metadata output according to user’s language setting if it’s configured to be U.S. English, Czech, Danish, German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Swedish, or Turkish. If user is not using one of the supported languages, Copilot will produce metadata in U.S. English by default. User can manually update their metadata before creating their tables and apps to minimize the impact. 

The Copilot capability of SharePoint List to table and app is currently supported in limited regions. Users located in regions that don’t currently support this Copilot feature are still able to use the SharePoint List to table and app feature without Copilot assistance. 

The autogenerated metadata of SharePoint List to table and app might not be 100% accurate. Users can minimize the impact by reviewing the metadata before table and app creation. 

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of SharePoint List to table and app? 

Users can configure the metadata settings of the table including display name, plural name, description, primary column, and schema name. This affects the metadata settings of the table when the table is created. 

Users can configure the metadata settings of the columns of the table including display name, data type, format, whether the column is required, schema name, and some other settings specific to each selected data type, such as choices and default choice when the datatype is choices. 

Users can configure the ownership of the table. Ownership depends on whether the data of the table is owned by specific users, teams, or the entire organization. 

## How can I use this feature in a Power Platform environment that is created outside of the United States or Switzerland? 

To do this, turn on data movement across regions. More information: Enable copilots and generative AI features outside United States and Switzerland
