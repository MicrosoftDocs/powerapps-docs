# FAQ for building apps and tables through conversation

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of build apps and tables through conversation feature.

## What is build apps and tables through conversation? 

Build apps and tables through conversation is a feature in the Power Apps that allows you to describe the app or table that you want to build, and AI will design it for you. To start, you use natural language to tell the AI assistant what kind of information you want to collect, track, or show. The assistant will generate a Dataverse table and use it to build your canvas app. The AI assistant is available from the Power Apps home page. 
 
## What are the system’s capabilities? 

This capability is powered by [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview), which uses powerful language models. These language models generate new text in English that looks and sounds like text written by humans.  

Using Azure OpenAI service as a foundation, build apps through conversation considers your app description to propose relevant data tables on which to build your app. As part of data generation, the system recommends relevant columns, sample row data, and data types that you can customize. The sample data is for illustration only and is fictitious. No real association is intended or inferred.

## What is the system’s intended use? 

Build apps and tables through conversation is intended to simplify your app creation process by automatically generating a data table on which your app will be built. AI-generated content may have mistakes. Make sure it's accurate and appropriate before using it. For more information, read the full [preview terms](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/legaldocs/supp-powerplatform-preview).
