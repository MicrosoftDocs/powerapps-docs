# Open table data in Excel

By opening table data in Microsoft Excel, you can quickly and easily view and edit data by using the Microsoft Power Apps Excel Add-in. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Excel Add-in.](./media/data-platform-cds-excel-addin/ExcelAddin.png "Power Apps Excel Add-in")

To install the Power Apps Excel add-in, see [Microsoft PowerApps Office Add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380330?tab=Overview). For more information about how to add or remove an Office Excel Add-in, see [Add or remove add-ins in Excel](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-or-remove-add-ins-in-excel-0af570c4-5cf3-4fa9-9b88-403625a0b460).

## Open table data in Excel

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Tables**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

2. Select the ellipsis (...) to the right of the table that you're interested in, and then select **Edit data in Excel**. 

3. Open the Excel worksheet that is downloaded to your browser's default download folder named similar to *table-name (1591125669213).xlsx*. This workbook has binding information for the table, a pointer to your environment, and a pointer to the Power Apps Excel add-in.

4. In Excel, select **Enable editing** to enable the Power Apps Excel Add-in to run. The Excel add-in runs in a pane on the right side of the Excel window.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the pane displays an error message, see [Office Store Add-in download disabling](#office-store-add-in-download-disabling). 

5. If this is the first time that you've run the Power Apps Excel add-in, select **Trust this Add-in** to allow the Excel add-in to run.

6. If you're prompted to sign in, select **Sign in**, and then sign in by using the same credentials that you used on [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). The Excel add-in will use a previous sign-in context and automatically sign you in if it can. Therefore, verify the user name in the upper right of the Excel add-in.

The Excel add-in automatically reads the data for the table that you selected. Note that there will be no data in the workbook until the Excel add-in reads it in.

## View and refresh data in Excel
After the Excel add-in reads table data into the workbook, you can update the data at any time by selecting **Refresh** in the Excel add-in.

## Edit data in Excel
You can change table data as you require and then publish it back by selecting **Publish** in the Excel Add-in.

To edit a row, select a cell in the worksheet, and then change the cell value.

To add a new row, follow one of these steps:

* Select anywhere in the worksheet, and then select **New** in the Excel add-in.
* Select in the last row of the worksheet, and then press the Tab key until the cursor moves out of the last column of that row, and a new row is created.
* Select in the row immediately below the worksheet and start to enter data in a cell. When you move the focus out of that cell, the worksheet expands to include the new row.

To delete a row, follow one of these steps:

* Right-click the row number next to the worksheet row to delete, and then select **Delete**.
* Right-click in the worksheet row to delete, and then select **Delete** > **Table Rows**.

## Configure the add-in to adjust tables and columns

You can use the data source designer in the Excel add-on to adjust the columns and tables that are automatically added to the worksheet.

1. Enable the data source designer of the Excel add-in by selecting the **Options** button (the gear symbol).

   :::image type="content" source="media/power-apps-excel-addin-settings.png" alt-text="Settings icon in the add-in pane.":::

1. Expand the **Data Connector** section, and then select the **Enable design** check box, and then select **OK**.

   <img src = "media/power-apps-excel-addin-settings2.png" alt = "Configuration option in the add-in" width = "407" height = "735">

1. Select **Design** in the Excel add-in. All the data sources are listed.

3. Next to the data source, select the **Edit** button (the pencil symbol).

4. Adjust the list in the **Selected columns** column as you require:
   * To add a column from the **Available columns** column to the **Selected columns** column, select the column, and then select **Add**. Alternatively, double-click the column.
   * To remove a column from the **Selected columns** column, select the column, and then select **Remove**. Alternatively, double-click the column.
   * To change the order of columns, select the column in the **Selected columns** column, and then select **Up** or **Down**.

5. Apply your changes to the data source by selecting **Update**, and then select **Done** to exit the designer. If you added a column (column), select **Refresh** to pull in an updated set of data.

> [!NOTE]
> - Make sure to always include the ID and required columns in your workbook, as you may receive errors when publishing.
> - When adding look up columns, make sure to add both the **ID** and the **Display** columns.

## Troubleshooting

* Not all tables support editing and creation of new rows, these tables will open in Excel and allow you to view data but publishing will be disabled.
* Look up columns must be edited using the add-in to ensure the correct row is referenced, updating these columns via copy and past or typing directly into the column is not supported.
* Image and file columns are not supported. You wonâ€™t be able to see any data when you open an Excel worksheet that includes those data types.
* The maximum table size when editing in Excel is one million cells. If there are too many rows or columns, not all data will be read or published.
* Rows are processed sequentially. If there is an error in saving a row, changes to subsequent rows will be aborted. Changes to preceding rows are kept.
* [Centralized deployment](/office/dev/add-ins/publish/centralized-deployment) is not supported. This add-in requires access to the Office store.
* Manually configuring the add-in might cause unexpected behavior. For best results, [download the Excel file with Power Apps](#open-table-data-in-excel-1) instead of starting from a blank Excel workbook.

If you encounter an issue that isn't described here, contact us via the [support pages](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/support/).

### Office Store add-in download disabling

If Office Store add-in downloading has been disabled for your organization, you might receive the following error message when you open the Excel worksheet after selecting the Edit data in Excel command. 

*Office 365 has been configured to prevent individual acquisition and execution of Office Store Add-ins.*

This setting prevents the Power Apps Excel Add-in from downloading. When this occurs, table row data will not be displayed in Excel. 

For more information about enabling Office Store Add-in downloading, contact your Office app administrator. 

For more information about preventing Office Store Add-in downloading from the Office Store, see [Prevent add-in downloads by turning off the Office Store across all clients](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-addins-in-the-admin-center?view=o365-worldwide#prevent-add-in-downloads-by-turning-off-the-office-store-across-all-clients-except-outlook&preserve-view=true).
