# Set managed properties for columns

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<a name="BKMK_SettingManagedProperties"></a>   

 Managed properties only apply when you include columns in a managed solution and import the solution into another environment. These settings allow a solution maker to have some control over the level of customization that people who install their managed solution can have when they customize this column. To set managed properties for a column, select **Managed Properties** on the menu bar.  
  
 The **Can be customized** option controls all the other options. If this option is `False`, none of the other settings apply. When it is `True`, you can specify the other customization options.  
  
 If the column is customizable, you set the following options to `True` or `False`.  
  
- **Display name can be modified**  
  
- **Can change requirement level**  
  
- **Can change Additional Properties**  
  
 These options are self-explanatory. If you set all the individual options to `False`, you might as well set **Can be customized** to `False`.
