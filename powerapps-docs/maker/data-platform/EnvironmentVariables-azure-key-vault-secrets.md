# Use environment variables for Azure Key Vault secrets

Environment variables allow for referencing secrets stored in Azure Key Vault. These secrets are then made available for use within Power Automate flows and custom connectors. Notice that the secrets aren't available for use in other customizations or generally via the API.

The actual secrets are stored in Azure Key Vault and the environment variable references the key vault secret location. Using Azure Key Vault secrets with environment variables require that you configure Azure Key Vault so that Power Platform can read the specific secrets you want to reference.

Environment variables referencing secrets aren't currently available from the dynamic content selector for use in flows.

## Configure Azure Key Vault

To use Azure Key Vault secrets with Power Platform, the Azure subscription that has the vault must have the `PowerPlatform` resource provider registered and the user who creates the environment variable must have appropriate permissions to the Azure Key Vault resource.

> [!NOTE]
> - We have recently changed the security role that we use to assert access permissions within Azure Key Vault. Previous instructions included assigning the Key Vault Reader role. If you have set up your key vault previously with the Key Vault Reader role, make sure that you add the Key Vault Secrets User role to ensure that your users and Dataverse will have sufficient permissions to retrieve the secrets.
> - We recognize that our service is using the Azure role-based access control APIs to assess security role assignment even if you still have your key vault configured to use the vault access policy permission model. To simplify your configuration, we recommended that you switch your vault permission model to Azure role-based access control. You can do this in the Access configuration tab.

1. Register the `Microsoft.PowerPlatform` resource provider in your Azure subscription.  Follow these steps to verify and configure: [Resource providers and resource types](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types)

   :::image type="content" source="media/env-var-secret1.png" alt-text="Register the Power Platform provider in Azure":::

1. Create an Azure Key Vault vault. Consider using a separate vault for every Power Platform environment to minimize the threat in case of a breach. Consider configuring your key vault to use **Azure role-based access control** for the **Permission model**. More information: [Best practices for using Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/best-practices#use-separate-key-vaults), [Quickstart - Create an Azure Key Vault with the Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)

1.	Users who create or use environment variables of type secret must have permission to retrieve the secret contents. To grant a new user the ability to use the secret, select the **Access control (IAM)** area, select **Add**, and then select **Add role assignment** from the dropdown. More information: [Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control](/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli)

      :::image type="content" source="media/env-var-secret2.png" alt-text="View my access in Azure":::

1. On the **Add role assignment** wizard, leave the default assignment type as **Job function roles** and continue to the **Role** tab. Locate the **Key Vault Secrets User role** and select it. Continue to the members tab and select the **Select members** link and locate the user in the side panel. When you have the user selected and shown on the members section, continue to the review and assign tab and complete the wizard.

1. Azure Key Vault must have the **Key Vault Secrets User** role granted to the Dataverse service principal. If it doesn't exist for this vault, add a new access policy using the same method you previously used for the end user permission, only using the Dataverse application identity instead of the user. If you have multiple Dataverse service principals in your tenant, then we recommend that you select them all and save the role assignment. Once the role is assigned, review each Dataverse item listed in the role assignments list and select the Dataverse name to view the details. If the **Application ID** isn't **00000007-0000-0000-c000-000000000000** then select the identity, and then select **Remove** to remove it from the list.

1. If you have enabled [Azure Key Vault Firewall](/azure/key-vault/general/network-security) you'll have to allow Power Platform IP addresses access to your key vault.  Power Platform isn't included in the "Trusted Services Only" option. Hence, refer to [Power Platform URLs and IP address ranges](/power-platform/admin/online-requirements#ip-addresses-required) article for the current IP addresses used in the service.

1. If you haven't done so already, add a secret to your new vault. More information: [Azure Quickstart - Set and retrieve a secret from Key Vault using Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal#add-a-secret-to-key-vault)

## Create a new environment variable for the Key Vault secret

Once Azure Key Vault is configured and you have a secret registered in your vault, you can now reference it within Power Apps using an environment variable.

> [!NOTE]
> - User access validation for the secret is performed in the background. If the user doesnâ€™t have at least read permission, this validation error is displayed: "This variable didn't save properly. User is not authorized to read secrets from 'Azure Key Vault path'."
> - Currently, Azure Key Vault is the only secret store that is supported with environment variables.
> - The Azure Key Vault must be in the same tenant as your Power Platform subscription.

1.	Sign on to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and in the **Solutions** area, open the unmanaged solution you're using for development.
1. Select **New** > **More** > **Environment variable**.
1.	Enter a **Display name** and optionally, a **Description** for the environment variable.
1. Select the **Data Type** as **Secret** and **Secret Store** as **Azure Key Vault**.
1. Choose from the following options:
   - Select **New Azure Key Vault value reference**. After the information is added in the next step and saved, an environment variable *value* record is created.
   - Expand **Show default value**, to display the fields to create a **Default Azure Key Vault secret**. After the information is added in the next step and saved, the default value demarcation is added to the environment variable *definition* record.
1. Enter the following information:
   - **Azure Subscription ID**: The Azure subscription ID associated with the key vault. 
   - **Resource Group Name**: The Azure resource group where the key vault that contains the secret is located.
   - **Azure Key Vault Name**: The name of the key vault that contains the secret.
   - **Secret Name**: The name of the secret located in Azure Key Vault.

        > [!TIP]
        > The subscription ID, resource group name, and key vault name can be found on the Azure portal **Overview** page of the key vault. The secret name can be found on the key vault page in the Azure portal by selecting **Secrets** under **Settings**.

1. Select **Save**.

## Create a Power Automate flow to test the environment variable secret

A simple scenario to demonstrate how to use a secret obtained from Azure Key Vault is to create a Power Automate flow to use the secret to authenticate against a web service.

> [!NOTE]
> The URI for the web service in this example is not a functioning web service.

1.	Sign into [PowerApps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), select **Solutions**, and then open the unmanaged solution you want. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. Select **New** > **Automation** > **Cloud flow** > **Instant**.
1. Enter a name for the flow, select **Manually trigger a flow**, and then select **Create**.
1.	Select **New step**, select the **Microsoft Dataverse** connector, and then on the **Actions** tab select **Perform an unbound action**.
1.	Select the action named **RetrieveEnvironmentVariableSecretValue** from the dropdown list.
1. Provide the environment variable unique name (not the display name) added in the previous section, for this example *new_TestSecret* is used.
1. Select **...** > **Rename** to rename the action so that it can be more easily referenced in the next action. In the below screenshot, it has been renamed to **GetSecret**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/env-var-secret4.png" alt-text="Instant flow configuration for testing an environment variable secret":::

1. Select **...** > **Settings** to display the **GetSecret** action settings.
1. Enable the **Secure Outputs** option in the settings, and then select **Done**. This is to prevent the output of the action getting exposed in the flow run history.

   :::image type="content" source="media/env-var-secret5.png" alt-text="Enable secure outputs setting for the action":::

1. Select **New step**, search and select the **HTTP** connector.
1. Select the **Method** as **GET** and enter the **URI** for the web service. In this example, the fictitious web service *httpbin.org* is used.
1. Select **Show advanced options**, select the **Authentication** as **Basic**, and then enter the **Username**.
1. Select the **Password** field, and then on the **Dynamic content** tab under the flow step name above (*GetSecret* in this example) select **RetrieveEnvironmentVariableSecretValueResponse EnvironmentVariableSecretValue**, which is then added as an expression `outputs('GetSecretTest')?['body/EnvironmentVariableSecretValue']` or `body('GetSecretTest')['EnvironmentVariableSecretValue']`.

   :::image type="content" source="media/env-var-secret6.png" alt-text="Create a new step using the HTTP connector":::

1. Select **...** > **Settings** to display the **HTTP** action settings.
1. Enable the **Secure Inputs** and **Secure Outputs** options in the settings, and then selectâ€¯**Done**. Enabling these options prevents the input and outputs of the action getting exposed in the flow run history.
1. Select **Save** to create the flow.
1. Manually run the flow to test it.

    Using the run history of the flow, the outputs can be verified.
