# Prompt columns (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

A prompt column in Microsoft Dataverse is a specialized data column designed to hold textual inputs that serve as prompts for AI models. These prompts can be anything from simple commands to complex queries. The AI model processes these prompts to generate relevant responses based on the input provided. This feature is particularly useful for automating content creation, data analysis, and decision-making tasks.

Example use cases:

- Customer support: Automate responses to frequently asked questions by using AI prompts to generate accurate and timely replies based on customer inquiries stored in Dataverse.
- Content creation: Use prompts to assist in writing articles, reports, or marketing materials by generating text that aligns with the input provided.
- Data analysis: Use AI prompts to analyze complex datasets and generate insights, sentiments, extract, and classify contents or summaries that help in making informed decisions.
- Workflow automation: Integrate AI prompts into business workflows to automatically run tasks such as scheduling, reporting, and data entry.

## Prerequisites

- Prompt columns use the same licensing model as AI builder prompts. More information: [Prompts overview](/ai-builder/prompts-overview#prerequisites)
- Copilot and AI Prompts features turned On in the Features area for the environment settings. More information: [Manage feature settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features?tabs=new#copilot-preview)

<!--Are there other prereqs such as does the environment have to be in a specific region, such as US? -->

## Create a prompt column 

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/). Select **Tables** on the left navigation pane.
1. Create a new table or open an existing table. More information: [Create a table](create-edit-entities-portal.md#create-a-table)
1. On the **Tables** page, select **New** > **Column**.
1. On the column properties page, enter a **Display name** and **Description** for your column.
1. Under the **Data type** dropdown list, select **Prompt**.
1. Clear the **Allow form fill assistance** checkbox.
1. Select **+Add new prompt**. You can create up to five prompt columns per table.
1. On the prompt column page, create a prompt. More information: [How to write an AI prompt for a prompt column](#how-to-write-an-ai-prompt-for-a-prompt-column)
1. Select **Save** on the prompt page.
1. Select **Save** on the column properties page to save your column.

## How to write an AI prompt for a prompt column

Crafting effective AI prompts is crucial for getting accurate and relevant responses from the AI model. You can use the prefilled prompt or write your own custom prompt.

To clear the prefilled prompt, highlight and delete it, or select the three dots to the left of **Model**, then select **Clear prompt**.

## Write effective prompts

Here are some best practices for writing prompts:

- Write clear instructions. Ensure that your prompts are clear and specific. Avoid ambiguity by being precise about what you want the AI to do. For example, instead of writing *Tell me about the weather*, write *Provide a summary of today's weather in Paris*.
- Use structured language. Structured language helps the AI model understand the context and intent of the prompt better. For example, *Generate a list of top 10 marketing strategies for 2025* is more effective than *Top marketing strategies*.
- Include contextual information. Provide necessary context within the prompt to help the AI model generate more accurate responses. For example, *Based on the sales data from Q1, suggest ways to improve our marketing campaign*. Add an input column in each prompt.

## Add input columns

1. Replace default input text by selecting it and then selecting **Delete**.
1. Select **+Add content**, and then select the table.
1. The column dropdown list appears. Select the input column from the list of columns from your table, and then select **Add**. In this example, the *Customer feedback* column is selected.
   :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-columns/prompt-column-add-columns.png" alt-text="Add an input column":::

   - There can be more than one input column in each prompt.
   - Input columns canâ€™t be formula columns, file columns, image data type, or another prompt column. If you select these data types, their input value is ignored.

1. Select **Save**.

## Test and refine prompts

Test your AI prompt. Create a test record with appropriate values in all your input columns to use for testing. For example, create a *Name* column in the table and enter some value that is used to identify the test record, such as *testing prompts*.

1. Create or select a prompt column.
1. While editing the prompt in a prompt column, select the input column to open the **Filter knowledge** pop-up screen.
1. Select the **Filter attribute** option. 
   :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-columns/prompt-column-filter-attribute.png" alt-text="Filter attribute option":::
1. Select the **Filter attribute** dropdown list and select a filter, such as *Name*. 
1. Enter the value of your testing record **Name**, such as *testing prompt*.
1. Select **Close**.
1. Select **Test** and review the **Model response**.
1. Select the **Knowledge used** tab to confirm that the input came from your test record.
   :::image type="content" source="media/prompt-columns/prompt-column-knowledge.png" alt-text="Knowledge used in prompt column" lightbox="media/prompt-columns/prompt-column-knowledge.png":::
1. Modify your prompt until you get the desired results.  
1. Return to the **Filter knowledge** pop-up and select **No filter** when your prompt changes are done.
1. Select **Save** to update your prompt column.

## View prompt column results

Create a model-driven app to view and validate your prompt column results.

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).
1. Open an app for editing or create a new app. More information:[Create a model-driven app](../model-driven-apps/create-model-driven-app.md)
1. In the app designer, select **Edit form** to edit the table form for the table that has the prompt columns.  
1. The form designer opens. Select all the input and prompt columns you want to add to the form. 
1. Select **Save and publish**. 
1. Go to the **Tables** area in Power Apps, and select **Views**.

<!-- After selecting Views, what should the user do next? What should they expect to see? What view do they open, etc? -->
