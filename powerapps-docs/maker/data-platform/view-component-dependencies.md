# View dependencies for a component
[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Solution components often depend on other solution components. You canâ€™t delete any solution component that has dependencies from another solution component. You can view the dependent components from the **Solutions** area of Power Apps.  


1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and select **Solutions** from the left navigation. 
2. Open the solution you want, select the component you want, on the command bar select **...,** and then select **Show dependencies**.
