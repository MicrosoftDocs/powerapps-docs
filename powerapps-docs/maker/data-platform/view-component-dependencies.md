# View dependencies for a component

Solution components often depend on other solution components. You canâ€™t delete any solution component that has dependencies from another solution component. You can view the dependent components from the **Solutions** area of Power Apps.  

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) and select **Solutions** from the left navigation. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
2. Open the solution you want, select the component you want, on the command bar select **...,** and then select **Show dependencies**.
