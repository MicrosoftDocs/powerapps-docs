# Get preview features early with the Dataverse accelerator (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Dataverse accelerator is a model-driven application that provides access to select preview features and tooling related to Dataverse development. The featured set of capabilities include early prototype experiences that represent backlog features scheduled to be in the native platform and tools for enriching Dataverse development for makers, delivered in a convenient and accessible web application built with low-code.

While preview features shouldn't be used in production instances, the accelerator offers the opportunity to proactively evaluate, share feedback, and prepare for integration. Using features available with the Dataverse accelerator helps you leverage cutting-edge capabilities to enhance productivity, optimize Dataverse processes, and maintain a competitive edge in Power Platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

The Dataverse accelerator interface adheres to the same UX and accessibility standards as any Microsoft Power Platform experience. Furthermore, it serves as a demonstration of our platform's powerful low-code capability to ship enterprise-grade applications.

## Features available with the Dataverse accelerator

| Feature | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Low-code plug-ins  | Reusable, real-time workflows that execute a specific set of commands within Dataverse. Low-code plug-ins run server-side and are triggered by personalized event handlers, defined in Power Fx. For more information about how to use this feature, go to [Low-code plug-ins](../low-code-plug-ins.md). |
| Plug-in monitor | A modern interface to surface the existing plug-in trace log table in Dataverse environments, designed for developing and debugging Dataverse plug-ins and custom APIs. For more information about how to use this feature, go to [Plug-in monitor](plugin-monitoring.md). |
| API playground | A preauthenticated software testing tool that helps makers quickly and conveniently interact with the [Dataverse Web API](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/overview). For more information about how to use this feature, go to [API playground](api-playground.md). |

> [!NOTE]
> If all features aren't available in the Dataverse accelerator app, update the app. More information: [update the Dataverse accelerator app](#install-or-update-the-dataverse-accelerator).

## Play the Dataverse accelerator

Play the Dataverse accelerator app in any environment where it's installed.

The app is automatically available in all new Microsoft Dataverse environments. If your environment doesn't already have it, you can  [install the Dataverse accelerator](#install-or-update-the-dataverse-accelerator).

The app appears in two places:

1. In [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Apps**

   :::image type="content" source="media/apps.svg" alt-text="Power Apps app list" lightbox="media/apps.svg":::

1. On the Power Apps or Dynamics 365 home page.

   ![Power Apps Unified Client Applications View](./media/uci.svg)

When you play the Dataverse accelerator, features are displayed in the accelerator that you can try out.

### Prerequisites to run the Dataverse accelerator

You must have the following privileges in your Dataverse environment:

- Security role: System customizer.
- App-level access to the Dataverse accelerator model driven app, such as system customizer or direct access from a security role.

### Prerequisites for managing the app

You must have the following security role assignment and your Dataverse environment must be the same or later than the minimum version:

- Security role: You must have the system administrator security role in the environment.

- A Dataverse environment with minimum database (DB) version of `9.2.22122.00148`. Check the database version:  
  - In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) > **Environments**, and then select the environment you want. Select **Detailed view**, and under **Version** the version is displayed.
  - By using the [RetrieveVersion function](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/retrieveversion) with your browser. Type `https://<your org>.<your region code>.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/RetrieveVersion` in your browser address bar and view the JSON returned.

## Install or update the Dataverse accelerator

If the Dataverse accelerator isn't already installed or if you want to install the latest version, Power Platform admins should follow these steps:

1. In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), select **Manage** > **Environments**, select the environment you want, and then select **Resources** > **Dynamics 365 apps** on the command bar. If you're using the earlier version of the admin center, expand **Resources**, and then select **Dynamics 365 apps**.
1. Find **Dataverse Accelerator** in the list. 
   - If **Update available** appears next to the **Dataverse Accelerator**, select the app and then select **Update**.
   - Otherwise, select **Install app**, select **Dataverse Accelerator** in the list, and then select **Next**.
1. Follow the instructions on your screen to apply the update.

### Uninstall the Dataverse accelerator

You can delete the Dataverse accelerator app from an environment using Power Platform CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting the Dataverse accelerator app doesn't delete all underlying capabilities presented in the app. The app provides a modern shell to the underlying platform API.

Using Power Platform CLI, [connect to the target environment](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/connection#pac-connection-create) and execute the three [solution delete](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/solution#pac-solution-delete) commands here:

```powershell
pac solution delete --solution-name msdyn_DataverseAcceleratorApp
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator
pac solution delete --solution-name DataverseAccelerator_Anchor
```
