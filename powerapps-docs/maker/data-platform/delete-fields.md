# Delete columns

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<a name="BKMK_DeletingFields"></a>   
As someone with the system administrator security role, you can delete any custom columns that arenâ€™t part of a managed solution. When you delete a column, any data stored in the column is lost. The only way to recover data from a column that was deleted is to restore the database from a point before the column was deleted.  
  
Before you can delete a custom table, you must remove any dependencies that may exist in other solution components.
1. In the **Solutions** area of Power Apps, open the solution that includes the column that you want to delete.
1. Open the table, select the **Column** tab, and then select the column you want to delete.
1. Select **Show Dependencies** on the command bar to view the **Dependent components** page.

For example, if the column is used in a form or view, you must first remove the column from those solution components.  
  
If you delete a lookup column, the 1:N table relationship for it will automatically be deleted.
