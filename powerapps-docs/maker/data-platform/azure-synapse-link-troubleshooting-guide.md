# Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse troubleshooting guide

When you open an Azure Synapse Link profile, you might see an error with a message and link to this article. In addition, users might also see **Error** status next to tables that are already in an Azure Synapse Link profile. Use this troubleshooting guide to diagnose and fix error conditions with Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse.

| Error message  | Cause  | Resolution |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **MSI-801**: Azure Synapse Link is unable to access storage account secured via MSI. Data updates are paused. | You have enabled managed services identify (MSI) to the storage account selected for this Azure Synapse Link profile. <br> Azure Synapse Link service doesn't have access to the storage account due to MSI configuration issues and the service has paused. <br> Revisit and verify MSI configuration | Verify that the MSI policy isn't deleted. <br> Validate that MSI is granted with the required access privileges. <br> More information: [MSI configuration](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-msi) <br> Once the required access is granted, the service resumes. |  
| **ADLS-802**: Azure Synapse Link is unable to access storage account. Data updates are paused. | Azure Synapse Link service can’t access storage account and the service has paused. <br> Permissions associated with storage account assigned to Azure Synapse Link profile might have changed or the storage account doesn't exist.| Verify that the storage account exists and that the Azure Synapse Link service has owner access to storage account. <br> More information: [Prerequisites](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-data-lake#prerequisites) <br> Once required access is granted, the service resumes. |
|**CT-803**: Row version change tracking configuration key disabled in linked environment. Data updates in some tables may be paused. | Azure Synapse Link service requires the configuration key **enable row version change tracking** enabled in the linked finance and operations apps environment. This configuration key is disabled in the linked environment and the service has paused finance and operations apps tables from the linked environment. <br> It's possible that a database restore operation caused the configuration to be reverted. <br> Enable the configuration key and remove and readd finance and operations apps tables to resume. Impacted tables are initialized to reflect new data. | Your administrator must reenable the finance and operations apps configuration key. <br> More information: [Add configurations in a finance and operations apps environment](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-select-fno-data#add-configurations-in-a-finance-and-operations-apps-environment) <br> The service resumes when the configuration key is reenabled.|
|**DV-804**: This environment is in admin mode and service is paused. | When a Power Platform environment is in administration mode all services including Azure Synapse Link service are temporarily paused. <br> When **Administration mode** is **Disabled**, the services are resumed. | Verify with your environment administrator and ensure that the environment is operational. <br> Also verify that the **Background operations** environment setting is **Enabled** after **Administration mode** is **Disabled**. <br> Azure Synapse Link service resumes when the environment is operational. |
|**SYN-805**: Synapse workspace isn't accessible. | Azure Synapse Link service can’t access the Synapse workspace associated with this profile. <br> Synapse tables might not be created immediately when you resolve this issue. The system creates tables in the Synapse workspace when data gets updated in Dataverse.| In the Synapse workspace networking configuration, enable the option  **Allow Azure services and resources to access this workspace**. |
| **SYN-806**: Default storage container in Synapse workspace isn't accessible. | Synapse workspace associated with this Azure Synapse Link profile doesn't contain a primary Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system. The default storage container might be deleted or the default storage container isn't accessible. <br> A default storage container is used by Synapse workspace as temporary storage in creating the file system. A default storage container must be provided when creating a Synapse workspace. <br> It's possible that this storage container was deleted or no longer accessible. | Ask your administrator to launch Synapse workspace and verify the name of the primary Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system.<br> Also verify that an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage container exists with that name within the same subscription. <br> If the storage container is missing, create a storage container with the same name. |
| **SYN-809**: Synapse workspace {name} has data exfiltration policies enabled. You need to choose another workspace. | Synapse Link profiles with Delta conversion option requires Synapse workpaces without data exfiltration policies. You have likely chosen a Synapse workspace with data exfiltration policies, which inteferes with Synapse Link compute services. | Ask your administrator to provide  a Synapse workspace where data exfilteration policies aren't enabled. You might also consider using Fabric link as an alternative to Synapse Link.|
| **SYN-810**: The default storage container associated with Synapse workspace is network restricted. | Synapse Link profiles with Delta conversion option requires Synapse workpaces with a default storage container. If the default storage container associated with the select Synapse workspace has network restrictions applied, Synapse Link compute services are unable to perform the required updates. | Ask your administrator to remove network restrictions associated with the default storage container associated with the Synapse workspace chosen or choose another Synapse workspace. |
| **SPARK-807**: Spark compute pool {name} in {Synapse workspace} is no longer available. Data updates are paused. | Azure Synapse Link service requires a Spark pool in order to process data into delta format. The Spark pool provided with this Azure Synapse Link profile is deleted or no longer available. <br> It's also possible that access to the Synapse workspace have been restricted. <br> Once you resolve the issue, Azure Synapse Link service resumes data updates when the data changes. | Verify that the Spark pool with the chosen name exists. If you or someone deleted this Spark pool, create the Spark pool with the same name. |
| **SPARK-808**: Spark compute pool {name} in {Synapse workspace} is insufficient. One or more tables could not be updated. | Azure Synapse Link service uses the Spark pool provided in the configuration to convert files to Delta parquet format as and when data is updated. <br> When a large batch of data is available for update, the size of the Spark pool provided in the Azure Synapse Link profile might not provide sufficient compute power. <br> This can happen especially when you add large tables as the initialization process creates a large batch of data. <br> This might also result in case you have a "pay as you go" subscriptions with limited capacity. The Spark pools within these types of subscriptions are limited in capacity. | Increase the number of cores in the assigned Spark pool. <br> The system consumes the increased capacity in case of larger workloads and scale down as needed. <br> More information: [Recommended Spark pool sizes for Delta conversion](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-delta-lake#recommended-spark-pool-configuration) |
| **CT-809**: Row version change tracking property disabled in table. Data updates are paused. | Azure Synapse Link service requires enabling the **Row version change tracking** metadata property. This property is disabled for the table and the table is no longer updated. <br> Updating this metadata property in finance and operations requires developer intervention. It's possible that the property was disabled after the Azure Synapse Link profile was created. | Re-enable the row version change tracking metadata property to resume this table. <br> You might need an administrator or developer to re-enable the property using developer tools. More information: [Enable row version change tracking for tables](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/rowversion-change-track#enable-row-version-change-tracking-for-tables) for details. | 
| **CT-810**:  The **Allow Row version change tracking** property of this table is set to No. | Azure Synapse Link service requires enabling the **Allow row version change tracking** metadata property to be set to **Yes**. <br> Updating this metadata property in finance and operations requires developer intervention. It's possible that the property was disabled after the Synapse Link profile was created. | Re-enable the row version change tracking metadata property to resume this table. <br> You might need an administrator or developer to re-enable the property using developer tools. More information: [Enable row version change tracking for tables](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/rowversion-change-track#enable-row-version-change-tracking-for-tables) for details. |
| **FnO-810**: Linked finance and operations environment is unavailable or paused. | Finance and operations apps environment linked to this Azure Synapse Link profile is either unavailable or in maintenance mode. Azure Synapse Link service is unable to contact the environment and the service has paused tables sourced from finance and operations apps. <br> In the case of cloud-hosted environments, it's possible that the environment is in a paused state. | Verify with your administrator that the linked environment isn't paused and isn't in maintenance mode. <br> Azure Synapse Link service resumes when the environment is in operational mode. |
|**FnO-811**: Linked finance and operations environment needs to be updated. | Finance and operations apps environment linked to this Azure Synapse Link profile needs to be updated to the latest version. <br> If you're currently on finance and operations versions PU60, PU61, or PU62, you must update to the latest cumulative updates <br> 10.0.36 (PU 60) - 7.0.7036.133 or later <br> 10.0.37 (PU 61) - 7.0.7068.109 or later <br> 10.0.38 (PU 62) - 7.0.7120.59 or later <br> The required updates are included in cumulative update 10.0.39 (PU63) | Contact your finance and operations apps administrator and apply the latest version updates to your environment. |
|**FnO-812**: Need to create additional indexes in your finance and operations environment. | When you select tables from a finance and operations apps environment, the system creates additional indexes in the database to enable performant data initialization and updates. This error indicates that indexes are missing for tables. This might be due to several reasons. <br> <br> if you're receiving this error from a Cloud Hosted Environment (CHE), you need to [enable specific flights and indexes as outlined in documentation](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-select-fno-data##additional-steps-to-configure-a-cloud-hosted-environment-che). <br> <br>If you're receiving this error from a sandbox or a production environment, index creation might be delayed due to heavy database operations. | If this is a CHE environment, contact the owner of the environment. <br> <br> If this is a sandbox or production environment, no action is needed. The system enables indexes on completion of peak workloads in finance and operations. |
| **FnO-813**: There is an unexpected NULL value in the field <...>. Verify data in the table and correct values as needed. | This error is the result of a data issue found by the service when transferring data from finance and operations apps. The finance and operations service doesn't allow NULL values in data fields. Therefore a NULL value is unexpected by the service. A space character represents the absence of a value in finance and operations apps. However, during data migration, especially using external tools, a NULL value might have been entered into a data field. | You can examine the table using the finance and operation app user interface or using a tool to resolve the issue. <br><br> The system resumes once the data issue has been resolved. You don't need to reinitialize the table. |
|**The following app(s) were not present in your tenant:...**: Azure Synapse Link cannot get all required app permission to create profile. | Missing App ID surfaced in UI error message. Here's the complete list of required app permissions:<ul><li>Export to data lake: `7f15f9d9-cad0-44f1-bbba-d36650e07765`</li> <li>Common Data Service - Azure Data Lake Storage: `546068c3-99b1-4890-8e93-c8aeadcfe56a` </li><li>Insights Apps Platform Prod: `99ff962b-6252-4b98-8478-0c65a3ea1925`</li> | Ask your administrator to add missing permissions in your Azure tenant by following these steps: <ul><li>Open PowerShell and connect to Azure with an authenticated account using the command: `Connect-AzAccount` </li><li>Add the principal by running the following command for the app ID: `New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId ‘7f15f9d9-cad0-44f1-bbba-d36650e07765’`</li>|
