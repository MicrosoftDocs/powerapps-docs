# Known limitations and troubleshooting with virtual tables

This article describes the known limitations and troubleshooting tips when working with virtual tables in Microsoft Dataverse.

The following is a list of known limitations for virtual tables created using the virtual connector provider.

## General limitations

- The table or list used must include at least one string field to be used as the primary field, and one GUID field. Without these string fields, the virtual table can't be created and an error is generated during the table details retrieval stage.
   - SharePoint uses the hidden numeric ID field present in all lists
   - SQL can use a GUID or integer field
   - Excel must have a GUID field
- Dataverse can only create columns that include data types compatible with Dataverse. This includes the following data types:
   - String
   - Multiline text (memo)
   - Whole Number/Integer
   - Decimal
   - Float
   - Date/time
   - Yes/No (boolean)
   - Choices (multi-value select)
   - Hyperlink/Url
- Data types not supported for virtual tables:
   - File and attachments
   - Image
- Maximum length of characters allowed for a text column in a virtual table is 4,000 characters. If the source table has a maximum character limit greater than this value, any create or update operation exceeding the max character limit results in a validation error, and the operation fails.
- Virtual table queries are limited to return 1,000 records. If you have a 1:N or N custom multi-table (polymorphic) relationship with a virtual table, any query exceeding this limit fails and provides an error. Use filtering in your query to reduce the record set as a workaround to this limitation.
- Audit functionality isn't available for virtual tables because Dataverse can only perform and store audit data for locally stored data.
- Rollups and calculated fields can't be calculated for virtual tables. This is because rollups are a server side calculation in Dataverse, which requires the data to be stored locally.
- The **Microsoft Entra ID** virtual table provided by Microsoft only allows read access.
- Dataverse virtual tables can display values in fields that exceed the normal maximum values of Dataverse. This behavior is because the values being presented aren't stored locally. For example, the Dataverse integer maximum value is 100,000,000,000, but it could retrieve and display 9,000,000,000,000 from SharePoint. However, if the user attempts to edit the number to a size larger than the max accepted size in Dataverse an error is provided indicating the record can't be saved because it exceeds the maximum size.
- Import and export functionality of table data isn't supported for virtual tables.

## For each data source limitations

The following are limitations for each data source.

# [SQL Server](#tab/sql)

- SQL virtual tables can use a GUID or an Integer field for the Primary Key for functionality. 
- SQL Server tables without primary keys: Any nonstring field can be selected as the primary key. The virtual table should be created successfully. `RetrieveMultiple` works, the other operations fail with the following error message (coming from SQL connector): "APIM request wasn't successful: BadRequest: No primary key exists in table." For functionality a GUID or integer field must be used as the primary key.
- SQL Server tables using a string primary key: The SQL string primary key is the only option available for the virtual table primary key. SQL Server string primary keys are supported only if the values can be parsed as GUID. If they can't be parsed as a GUID, the virtual table creation succeeds, but fails at runtime with the following errors:
   - Power Apps (make.powerapps.com): "We weren't able to open your table. Try reloading or reopening."
   - Network trace: "String primary keys are supported only if they can be parsed as GUID."
- SQL Server tables without nonprimary key string fields for use as the Primary Name: If the SQL table doesn't have a string field available to use as the Primary Name, we display the following error in the configuration step: "The table doesn't have a primary field"
- SQL views can be used to create a virtual table but they'll only provide read operations.
- For SQL Server connector limitations, go to [SQL Server connector reference](/connectors/sql/).
- SQL data type bigint columns in the source table are mapped as a decimal data type in Dataverse virtual tables. When platform support is available for bigint mapping to a whole number, previously created columns in the virtual table need to be deleted, and new columns should be created.
- The following column types can't be included in a virtual table at this time:
   - Time
   - Datetime2
   - Image
   - Geometry
   - Geography
   - RowVersion
 - The following column types are included in a virtual table but are only shown as text fields:
   - HierarchyID
   - XML
   - Sqlvariant

# [Microsoft Excel Online (Business)](#tab/excel)
- Excel is currently not supported in the table driven virtual table experience.
- Excel files must be stored on a OneDrive to participate in a virtual table connection. 
- The primary key column should be included in the create form if you didn't set up the column to increment during the design of the underlying source table automatically. You have to enter a valid value in the primary key column for an insert operation to succeed. 
- If entity catalog creation takes a long time, you can check the job completion status by going to **Settings** > **Advanced settings** > **Settings** > **System Jobs**.
- The primary key can only be a column holding GUID values: Because the Excel table metadata shows all columns as string, our current design assumes that the primary key is always a GUID represented as a string. 
   > [!NOTE]
   > No validation is performed when the virtual table is created, if a non-GUID column is selected, the table fails at runtime with this error: "String primary keys are supported only if they can be parsed as GUID". 
- Support for `PowerAppsId__` autogenerated column: The `PowerAppsId` autogenerated column is used if found (it's the only option available for primary key). Providing a value for `PowerAppsId` is required at record creation even if the value is actually overwritten by an automatically generated one. This doesn't happen if the primary key column isn't the `PowerAppsId` autogenerated column. 
- The following column types can't be included in a virtual table at this time: 
   - Time (these are created as date and time fields).
- Specific Excel connector limitations go to: [Excel Online (Business) connector reference](/connectors/excelonlinebusiness/).

# [Microsoft SharePoint](#tab/sharepoint)

- You currently can't select an **All** view for SharePoint columns on a virtual table. This is a known issue.
- The following column types can't be included in a virtual table at this time:
   - Person
   - Image
   - Managed metadata
   - Location: coordinates
   - Attachment
- SharePoint specific columns that are shown in the virtual table:
   - **Compliance Asset ID** is an internal column from SharePoint for tracking purposes. It can be ignored.
   - **ID** is the external primary key from SharePoint. It's read-only and can be ignored.

# [Salesforce (preview)](#tab/salesforce)

- For Salesforce connector limitations, go to [Salesforce connector reference](/connectors/salesforce/).
- Fields that are referencing other Salesforce objects are locked.

# [Oracle (preview)](#tab/oracle)

- For Oracle connector limitations, go to [Oracle connector reference](/connectors/oracle/).
- Oracle table needs to have a primary key defined.
- Oracle table needs to have at least one string type field besides the primary key.

## Troubleshooting

- There's only one (1) record in your virtual table even though you have more in your source table.<br />
  **Solution:** Check your source table and make sure it has a primary key defined.
  
- You get one of the following errors when Power Apps (make.powerapps.com) is retrieving a table list or when you select **Finish** to create a table:
   - "Resource not found for the segment `msdyn_get_required_fields`"
   - “Error calling... please verify that connection... exists in environment”
   - "Sequence matches no element for `msdyn_get_required_fields`"<br />
  **Solution**: In some cases you might not have the most up to date solution for the virtual connector provider. To determine whether your virtual connector provider solution needs an update:

  1. Select **Solutions** on the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
  1. Select the **History** tab.
  1. **Search** for `ConnectorProvider`.
  1. View the information to see whether the solution needs to be updated.
  1. If the history indicates an update is needed, go to [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) search for **Virtual Connector Provider**, and then select **Get it now** to import the solution into your environment.
  1. Follow the steps to create the virtual table again.

- A message is displayed “Connection ‘xyz’ not found in current environment.” when retrieving the list of connections.<br />
   **Solution**: This occurs when there are a large number of connections in the user's Dataverse environment. This is fixed with version 1,029 of the Connector Provider solution.
  To determine whether your virtual connector provider solution needs an update:

  1. Select **Solutions** on the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
  1. Select the **History** tab.
  1. **Search** for `ConnectorProvider`.
  1. View the information to see whether the solution needs to be updated.
  1. If the history indicates an update is needed, go to [the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) search for **Virtual Connector Provider**, and then select **Get it now** to import the solution into your environment.
  1. Follow the steps to create the virtual table again.

- You get notified that a timeout occurred during the virtual table creation. <br />
   **Solution**: This can occur when other existing jobs cause the virtual table creation to be delayed. Wait for a few minutes and try again.

- You get notified that "An unexpected error occurred" <br />
  **Solution**: This occurs when the virtual table data source was created with invalid values. To resolve this, you need to locate the virtual table data source that is causing the error, delete it, and then re-create the virtual table.

   1. Select **Settings** (gear icon) > **Advanced settings** from [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
   2. In the top menu, select **Settings**.
   3. Go to **Solutions**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
   4. Go to the solution that includes your virtual table (if you weren't using a solution then go to Common Data Services Default Solution).
   5. In the left hand panel, select **Virtual table data sources**.
   6. Double-click each data source (they all start with `VCP_DS_..."`), when you locate the one with the error, delete that data source.
   7. Re-create your virtual table.

- A message is displayed "This table already exists, you're recreating the table. Primary field and Schema name can't be changed."<br />
  **Solution**: This table has previously been created. Continuing with the creation re-creates the table, this results in any table changes made at the data source to be updated in the virtual table (this includes addition or removal of fields). The custom name and primary field values won't be editable.

- Error message: “primary_key_name can't be empty”<br />
  **Solution**: You have chosen a table or list that doesn't include a GUID value for the primary key. You need to add an additional GUID column in your source table in order to create a virtual table.

- You created an Excel virtual table but don't see it in the **Tables** area in Power Apps.<br />
  **Solution**: Since the virtual table creation is asynchronous, you can check the status of the process in **System Jobs**. Look for system jobs with a Name starting `Microsoft.Wrm.DataProvider.Connector.Plugins.ConnectorGenerateVEPlugin` and a **Regarding** column's value equal to the name of the new virtual table. If status is still **In Progress**, just wait for the job to complete. If there's an error, you can get details by selecting the system, job name hyperlink. In this example, table creation is still pending:

   :::image type="content" source="media/ve-table-creation-pending.png" alt-text="table creation pending":::

   Here, table creation failed due to 429 "Too Many Requests" error:

   :::image type="content" source="media/ve-table-creation-failed-429-error.png" alt-text="table creation failed due to 429 error":::

- Table creation's system job succeeded but you receive runtime errors related to invalid or missing columns.<br />
  **Solution**: If a failure occurs while you create a table field, the table creation process doesn't fail and try to continue with the remaining fields. This is because the system doesn't want to block the virtual table creation when some column types are unsupported. To get details on the error, enable logging in **Administration**> **System Settings** > **Customizations** > **Enable logging to plug-in trace log**, then delete the virtual table and try to create it again.
