# Transport the Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse configuration across environments

In Power Apps, solutions are used to transport apps and components from one environment to another, or to apply a set of customizations to existing apps. Making the Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse configurations solution-aware enables basic application lifecycle management (ALM) abilities such as distribution, copy, and backup and restore of the Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Synapse Link for Microsoft Dataverse was formerly known as Export to data lake. The service was renamed effective May 2021 and will continue to export data to Azure Data Lake as well as Azure Synapse Analytics.
