# Create new data columns in Dataverse

Columns in Microsoft Dataverse define the individual data items that can be used to store information in a table. Column data is used in apps to display information on forms, in views, and can be used in searches within an app. By default, the account main form has several columns,  such as account name, phone, fax, website, and so on.

With the exception of choices columns, all columns depend on a table. Columns support many different data types, such as text, number, date and time, lookup (links to another table), currency, autonumber, file, or Power Fx formula.

Create new columns to capture data when existing standard tables donâ€™t have columns that meet your requirements. After you create a new column, be sure to include it on the appropriate forms and views for the table so that they are available in your app.

Watch this short video that shows you how to quickly create a column.

## Create a column

1. Select the table where you want to add a column. If the solution doesn't already have the table, select **Add existing** > **Table** or to create a new table select **New** > **Table**.
1. On the tables page, select **New** > **Column**.
