# Columns overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Columns define the individual data items that can be used to store information in a table. Create new columns to capture data when existing standard tables donâ€™t have columns that meet your requirements. After you create a new column, be sure to include it on the appropriate forms and views for the table so that they are available in your app.
