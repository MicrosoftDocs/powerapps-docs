# Create new data columns in Dataverse

Columns, also known as fields or attributes, in Microsoft Dataverse define the individual data items that can be used to store information in a table. Column data is used in apps to display information on forms, in views, and can be used in searches within an app. By default, the account main form has several columns,  such as account name, phone, fax, website, and so on.

With the exception of choices columns, all columns depend on a table. Columns support many different data types, such as text, number, date and time, lookup (links to another table), currency, autonumber, file, or Power Fx formula.

Create new columns to capture data when existing standard tables donâ€™t have columns that meet your requirements.

## How table columns are used in apps

After you create a new column, you include it on the appropriate forms, using the [form designer](../model-driven-apps/form-designer-overview.md), and views, using the [view designer](../model-driven-apps/accessing-view-definitions.md), for the table so that they're available in your app.

Here are default columns on a form for the account table in a model-driven app.

Create a column in Power Apps (make.powerapps.com). You can also create columns while working in the model-driven app form designer or view designer.

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then select **Solutions** in the left navigation pane. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]
1. Select the table where you want to add a column. If the solution doesn't already have the table, select **Add existing** > **Table** or to create a new table select **New** > **Table**.
1. In the table **Schema** area, select **Columns**.
1. In the list of columns for the table, select **New column**.
1. Complete the required and optional properties for the column, and then select **Save**.
