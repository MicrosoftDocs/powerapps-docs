# Set managed properties for relationships

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<a name="BKMK_ManagedProperties"></a>   

 Managed properties only apply when you include a column with a managed solution and import it into another organization. These settings allow a solution maker to have some control over the level of customization that they want to allow people who install their managed solution to have when they customize a table relationship. To set managed properties for a relationship, in solution explorer expand the table, open the relationship, and then select  **Managed Properties** on the menu bar.  
  
 With relationships, the only managed property is **Can Be Customized**. This single setting controls all changes that can be made to the table relationship.
