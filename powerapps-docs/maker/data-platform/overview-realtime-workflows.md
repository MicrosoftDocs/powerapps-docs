# Microsoft Dataverse real-time workflows 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Workflows automate business processes without a user interface. People usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesn’t require any user interaction.

There are two types of workflows:
- Background workflows. See the [Power Automate](/power-automate/workflow-processes) documentation for more details about background workflows.
- Real-time workflows. 

## Real-time workflows

To create real-time workflows, you must *clear* the **Run this workflow in the background (recommended)** check box, while defining the workflow.

See other topics here in the Power Apps documentation to learn more about real-time workflows.
