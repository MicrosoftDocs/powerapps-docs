# Use a connection reference in a solution

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

A connection  is a proxy or a wrapper around an API that allows the underlying service to talk to Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps. It provides a way for users to connect their accounts and use a set of pre-built actions and triggers to build their apps and workflows.

A connection reference is a solution component that contains information about a connector. Both canvas app and operations within a Power Automate flow bind to a connection reference. You can import your connection reference into a target environment with no further configuration needed after the import completes. To change a specific connection associated with a canvas app or flow, you edit the connection reference component within the solution.

You can add a connection reference to a solution in a few different ways:
- From the **Solutions** area as described in this article.
- During solution import. More information: [Import solutions](import-update-export-solutions.md)
- When you build your [canvas apps](../canvas-apps/add-app-solution.md) and [flows](/power-automate/create-flow-solution) in a solution.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Canvas apps and flows handle connections differently. Flows use connection references for all connectors, whereas canvas apps only use them for implicitly shared connections, such as SQL Server. More information: [Security and types of authentication](../canvas-apps/connections-list.md#security-and-types-of-authentication)
> - A connection reference is automatically created when you create new connections from the flow and canvas app designers.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and on the left pane select **Solutions**. 
2. Create a new or open an existing solution.
3. On the command bar select **New**, and then in the list of components select Connection Reference. 
4. On the **New Connection Reference** pane, enter the following information. Required columns are denoted with an asterisk (*).
   - **Display name**: Enter a friendly name to help differentiate this connection reference from others.
   - **Description**: Enter text that describes the connection.
   - **Connector**: Choose from the following options:
       - Select an existing connector from the list.
       - Select **New** to create a new connection to use for this connection reference. Once your finished creating the connection, select **Refresh** to select your new connection from the list.  
5. Select **Create**.

## Limits

While connection references are in preview, one connection reference can only be used within a maximum of 16 flows. If the same connection needs to be used in more than 16 flows, then create another connection reference with a connection to the same connector. There is no limit to the number of actions in each flow that can be associated with the connection reference.
