# Create one-to-many or many-to-one table relationships overview

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

In Microsoft Dataverse 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) relationships define how two tables are related to each other. 
  
Before you create a custom table relationship, evaluate whether using an existing table relationship would meet your requirements. <br />More information: [Create new metadata or use existing metadata?](create-edit-metadata.md#create-new-metadata-or-use-existing-metadata)

There are two designers you can use to create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) relationships:

|Designer| Description|
|--|--|
|[Power Apps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc)|Provides an easy streamlined experience, but some special settings are not available.<br />More information: [Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships in Power Apps portal](create-edit-1n-relationships-portal.md)|
|Solution explorer|Not as easy, but provides for more flexibility for less common requirements. <br />More information: [Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships using solution explorer](create-edit-1n-relationships-solution-explorer.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create new table relationship in your environment using the following:
> - In model-driven apps, select **New Column** from the form editor and create a *Lookup* column. <br />More information: [Add, configure, move, or delete columns on a form](../model-driven-apps/add-move-or-delete-fields-on-form.md)
> - Create a new Lookup column for the related table. <br />More information: [Create and edit columns](create-edit-fields.md)
> - Import a solution that contains the definition of the table relationship. <br />More information: [Import, update, and export solutions](import-update-export-solutions.md)
> - Use Power Query to create new tables and fill them with data. <br />More information: [Add data to a table in Dataverse by using Power Query](add-data-power-query.md).
> - A developer can use [Metadata services](../../developer/data-platform/metadata-services.md) to write a program to create and update table relationships. <br />More information: [Customize table relationship metadata](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/customize-table-relationship-metadata)

Information in this topic will help you choose which designer you can use. 

You should use the Power Apps portal to create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships unless you need to address any of the following requirements:

- Configure column mappings
- Configure navigation pane options for model-driven app
- Configure relationship behaviors
- Define whether the relationship is hidden in advanced find.
- Make a Hierarchical relationship
