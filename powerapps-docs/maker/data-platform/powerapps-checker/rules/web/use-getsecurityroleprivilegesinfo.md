# `use-getsecurityroleprivilegesinfo`

Avoid `userSettings.securityRolePrivileges`. This returns only privilege GUIDs, which are difficult to work with. You might be making extra network requests to get further details about the privilege GUID and that degrades performance. Use [userSettings.getSecurityRolePrivilegesInfo()](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/xrm-utility/getglobalcontext/usersettings#getsecurityroleprivilegesinfo) instead, which gives you more details about each security role privilege.
