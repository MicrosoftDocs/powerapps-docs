# `avoid-loadtheme`

`loadTheme` is a way to provide a theme in global (and only global) scope, which will affect your entire application. We recommend that you replace `loadTheme` with `ThemeProvider`. That way, your application consistently has one way of providing a theme.

## Recommendation

For details on the correct `ThemeProvider` usage go to the [ThemeProvider](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/How-to-apply-theme-to-Fluent-UI-React-components#themeprovider-in-preview) documentation.
