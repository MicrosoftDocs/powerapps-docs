# Configure a table for feedback/ratings



Let customers or employees submit feedback for any table record, or rate table records within a defined rating range by enabling tables for feedback. Use this capability for the following scenarios: 
- For customers to capture data via a portal or survey.
- To collect data about service or product satisfaction from table records. 
- For employees to provide comments on collaborative efforts or as a way to improve on products and services.

For example, imagine you have an app that is used to maintain recipes and you want to get feedback from your users about their experience using the recipes in the app.

## Configure feedback for a table
  
First, you must enable the **Allow feedback** property in the table definition.

1. Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Open the table you want or create a new one. More information: [Edit a table](edit-entities.md)
1. On the right table properties pane, select **Allow feedback**.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Once you enable the **Allow feedback** property for a table, you canâ€™t disable it. 
   :::image type="content" source="media/table-allow-feedback.png" alt-text="Enable allow feedback in the table definition":::

1. Select **Done**, and then select **Save Table**.

 
### Add a subgrid for feedback on the table form  

By default, users must go to the list of associated records of the record you want to add feedback to. To make it easier for users to add feedback, you should add a feedback subgrid to the form of the table you are enabling feedback for, such as in the recipe example depicted earlier in this article.  

1. In the form designer, select the area of the form where you want the feedback subgrid, and then select **Subgrid** on the left **Components** pane.
1. Select the following subgrid properties, and then select **Done**: 
   - **Show related records**
   - **Table Feedback (Regarding)**
   - **Default view**. **Active Feedback**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/configure-subgrid-for-feedback.png" alt-text="Configure the subgrid for feedback records":::
1. **Save** and **Publish** the form.

### About the feedback table form

The feedback subgrid displays commands for creating new or adding existing feedback. When a user selects **Create Feedback** from the subgrid, the records to create feedback use the feedback standard table.

The feedback table form has the following columns:
- **General**
  - **Title**: User provided title for the record feedback.
   - **Regarding**: System provided table record that the feedback is associated with.
   - **Source**: The feedback source to display where the feedback was submitted. If the feedback was created from within a model-driven app, the default value is set to **Internal** while **Portal** is the other option. This can be changed by the user.
   - **Created By**: System provided value that's the user who created or last modified the feedback record.
- **Comments**
   - **Minimum Rating**: The user can define a range for ratings by specifying a minimum and maximum (numerical) value for ratings. For example, a minimum rating of 1.
   - **Maximum Rating**: The user can define a range for ratings by specifying a minimum and maximum (numerical) value for ratings. For example, a scale of maximum rating of 5.
   - **Normalized Rating**. System generated numeric value that's automatically calculated to show the specified user rating scaled to a value between 0 and 1 based on the minimum and maximum rating values.

      The normalized rating helps to normalize or even out the specified rating value for different rating ranges (minimum and maximum rating values). The normalized rating is calculated as follows: (Rating - Minimum Rating) / (Maximum Rating - Minimum Rating).
      Also, rating for a record is calculated as an average of all the normalized ratings for the record.
   - **Rating**: User provided rating for the feedback that must be between the minimum and maximum range. For example, a rating of 4 on a scale of 1-5.
   - **Comments**: User provided comments for the record feedback.

## Add a rollup column for the feedback

Optionally, you can create a rollup column that's based on the feedback or ratings for the table, and then add it to the form of the table you're enabling for feedback.

For example, you can provide a running total of all feedback records created for a given record.
1. Open the table that contains the form with the feeback grid and select the **Columns** tab.
1. Select **Add column**, and then select the following properties:
   - **Display name**: *Total feedback*
   - **Data type**: **Whole Number**
   - **Calculated or Rollup**: Select **Add** > **Rollup**. Select **Save** when prompted.
1. Select **Done**. Select the **Total feedback** column, and then in the right column properties pane select **Open rollup**.
1. The rollup editor opens in a new browser window. Configure the following rollup conditions, and then select **Save and Close**: 
   - **Source entity**:
      - **Source**. Recipe (or the table that has the feedback subgrid)
      - **Use Hierarchy**: **No**
   - **Related entity**:
      - **Feedback (Regarding)**
      - **Filters**: **If Status equals Open**
   - **Aggregation**:
      - **Count of Feedback**
   :::image type="content" source="media/total-feedback-rollup-column.png" alt-text="Rollup column that displays the total feedback count":::
1. Add the column to the form that has the feedback subrid, save and publish it.

The form in an app now displays a running total of all feedback records submitted for the record.
