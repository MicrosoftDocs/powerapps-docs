# Delete a table


You can delete custom tables, but you can't delete standard tables. Notice that you can't delete a custom table while it has one or more dependent components. More information: [Delete a table that has dependencies](#delete-a-table-that-has-dependencies)

> [!WARNING]
> When you delete a table, you delete both the table definition and all data that the table contains. Tables and the data within them can't be recovered if deleted.

## Delete a custom table
1. Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), select **Solutions** in the left navigation pane, open the solution that contains the custom table you want to delete, and then select it.

    ![Table Details.](./media/data-platform-cds-create-entity/entitylist.png "Table List")

2. On the command bar select **Remove**, and then select from the following choices:  
   - **Remove from this solution**. Removes the table from the solution. You can still access the table from the Default Solution. 
   - **Delete from this environment**. Deletes the table and associated data. 

3. In the dialog box that appears, select **Delete** to delete the table. If you receive a message that the *component cannot be deleted because it is referenced by other components*, see the next section in this article. 

## Delete a table that has dependencies
You canâ€™t delete a table while it has a dependency on another component, such as a business process flow or a model-driven app. 

There are two ways that you can remove a dependency: 
- Reconfigure the component to remove the dependency. 
- Delete the component. 

### Remove a dependency
To find the dependencies for a component, see [View dependencies for a component](view-component-dependencies.md). 

Next, remove the component. For example, if you have a business process flow that references a table you want to delete, edit the business process flow to remove that table. Once the business process flow no longer references that table, the table will no longer appear in the show dependencies list and can be deleted. More information: [Delete a custom table](#delete-a-custom-table)   

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing the dependency, can cause the component to no longer work. For example, removing a table from a model-driven app may cause the model-driven app to no longer work.
