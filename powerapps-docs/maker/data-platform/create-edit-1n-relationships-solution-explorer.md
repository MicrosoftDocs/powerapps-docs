# Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships using solution explorer 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Solution explorer provides one way to create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships for Microsoft Dataverse.

The [Power Apps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) enables configuring the most common options, but certain options can only be set using solution explorer. More information: 
- [Create 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) relationships](create-edit-1n-relationships.md)
- [Create and edit 1:N (one-to-many) or N:1 (many-to-one) table relationships in Power Apps portal](create-edit-1n-relationships-portal.md)
  
## Open solution explorer

Part of the name of any custom relationship you create is the customization prefix. This is set based on the solution publisher for the solution you’re working in. If you care about the customization prefix, make sure that you are working in an unmanaged solution where the customization prefix is the one you want for this table. More information: [Change the solution publisher prefix](create-solution.md#solution-publisher) 

[!INCLUDE [cc_navigate-solution-from-powerapps-portal](../../includes/cc_navigate-solution-from-powerapps-portal.md)]

## View table relationships

In solution explorer, expand **Tables** an select a table. Within that table, select either **1:N Relationships** or **N:1 Relationships**

![View table relationships](media/view-1n-entity-relationships-solution-explorer.png)

## Create relationships

While [viewing table relationships](#view-table-relationships), select either **New 1-to-Many Relationship** or **New Many-to-1 Relationship** from the command bar.

> [!NOTE]
> If the commands are not available, the table is not eligible to create a custom relationship.

Either option will open a form like the following. The difference is whether the **Primary table** or **Related table** column is set.

![New one-to-many relationship form](media/new-1n-entity-relationship-form-solution-explorer.png)

- With **1:N Relationship**, the **Primary table** is set to the current table
- With **N:1 Relationship**, the **Related table** is set to the current table

The following columns must be set in order to save the table relationship:

|Required Column|Description|
|--|--|
|**Primary table**|This table will be the target type for the lookup column created on the related table.|
|**Related table**|This table will have a lookup column added to associate the table rows with the primary table row.|
|**Name**|The name of the relationship. A value will be generated based on the primary and related table values. This column will be prefixed by the customization prefix of the solution publisher.|
|**Lookup Column Display Name**|The localizable text for the lookup column that will be created for the related table. This is usually the same as the display name for the primary table. <br /> This can be changed later.|
|**Lookup Column Name**|The name of the lookup column that will be created on the related table. A value will be generated based on the **Lookup Column Display Name**. This column will be prefixed by the customization prefix of the solution publisher.|

You can click ![Save table relationship button](media/save-entity-icon-solution-explorer.png) to save the table and continue editing. More information: [Edit relationships](#edit-relationships)

> [!NOTE]
> If either the **Name** or **Lookup Column Name** values already exist in the system you will get an error when you save. Edit the values so that they are unique and try again.

## Edit relationships

While [viewing table relationships](#view-table-relationships), select the table you want to edit. The following table relationship properties can be edited after the relationship is created.

> [!NOTE]
> The publisher of a managed solution can prevent some customizations of relationships that are part of their solution.

### Table relationship properties

These properties are about the relationship.

|Column|Description|
|--|--|
|**Searchable**|Whether this relationship should be visible within Advanced Find in model-driven apps. Select **No** if this is a relationship that isn't important for your business.|
|**Hierarchical**|This option is enabled only for self-referential relationships. Whether the table should be considered to define a hierarchy for the table.<br />**Important**: Once you set this property rollup columns, processes, and views may be configured to depend on this property. If you later change this value those capabilities that depend on the hierarchy will not work. <br />More information: [Define and query hierarchically related data](define-query-hierarchical-data.md)|

### Lookup column

These are the properties of the lookup column created on the related table. The properties can be edited here or by editing the lookup column directly. Some column properties are not editable from the relationship. More information: [Edit a column](create-edit-field-solution-explorer.md#edit-a-column)

|Column|Description|
|--|--|
|**Display Name**|The localizable text for the lookup column that will be created for the related table.|
|**Column requirement**|Whether the column must have data before a form in a model-driven app can be saved. More information: [Column Requirement options](create-edit-field-solution-explorer.md#column-requirement-options)|
|**Description**|Enter instructions to the user about what the column is for. These descriptions appear as tooltips for the user in model-driven apps when they hover their mouse over the label of the column.|

### Navigation Pane Item for Primary table

From the primary table you can navigate to see related rows. This data is used by model-driven apps to control how the related table rows are displayed. These settings can also be edited using the form editor.

|Column|Description|
|--|--|
|**Display Option**|How the related table list should be displayed. More information: [Display Options](#display-options)|
|**Custom Label**|Specify the localizable text to be used instead of the plural name when you select **Use Custom Label** as the **Display Option** .|
|**Display Area**|Select one of the available groupings to display this list. The available options are: **Details** (for the *Common* group), **Marketing**, **Sales**, and **Service**. |
|**Display Order**|Controls where the navigation item will be included within the selected display area. The range of allowed numbers begins with 10,000. Navigation pane items with a lower value appear above other relationships with a higher value.|

<!-- TODO: Not sure whether Display Area or Display Order are still used anymore. Might only be used in the Outlook client?-->

#### Display Options

These are the available display options:

|Option|Description|
|--|--|
|**Do not Display**|Do not display the related tables for this relationship.|
|**Use Custom Label**|When this option is chosen, the **Custom Label** column is enabled so that you can specify the localizable text to be used instead of the plural name.|
|**Use Plural Name**|Use the plural display name defined for the related table.|

### Relationship Behavior

This where you can define standard behaviors for related tables. This information is important because it helps ensure data integrity and can automate business processes for your company.

Let’s look at an example.  
  
Let’s say that you have a new salesperson and you want to assign them a number of existing opportunities currently assigned to another salesperson. Each opportunity row may have a number of task activities associated with it. You can easily locate the active opportunities you want to reassign and assign them to the new salesperson. But what should happen for any of the task activities that are associated with the opportunities? Do you want to open each task and decide whether they should also be assigned to the new salesperson? Probably not. Instead, you can let the relationship apply some standard rules for you automatically. These rules only apply to task rows associated to the opportunities you are reassigning. Your options are:  
  
- Reassign all active tasks.  
- Reassign all tasks. 
- Reassign none of the tasks.  
- Reassign all tasks currently assigned to the former owner of the opportunity.  
  
The relationship can control how actions performed on a row for the primary table row cascade down to any related table rows.   

There are several kinds of behaviors that can be applied when certain actions occur.

#### Behaviors

These are the behaviors available to be configured.

|Behavior|Description|
|--|--|
|**Cascade Active**|Perform the action on all active related table rows.|
|**Cascade All**|Perform the action on all related table rows.|
|**Cascade None**|Do nothing.|
|**Remove Link**|Remove the lookup value for all related rows.|
|**Restrict**|Prevent the primary table row from being deleted when related table rows exist.|
|**Cascade User Owned**|Perform the action on all related table rows owned by the same user as the primary table row.|

#### Actions

These are the actions that can trigger certain behaviors:

|Column|Description|Options|
|--|--|--|
|**Assign**|What should happen when the primary table row is assigned to someone else?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Reparent**|What should happen when the lookup value of a related table in a parental relationship is changed?<br />More information: [Parental table relationships](#parental-table-relationships)|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Share**|What should happen when the primary table row is shared?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Delete**|What should happen when the primary table row is deleted?|Cascade All<br />Remove Link<br />Restrict|
|**Unshare**|What should happen when a primary table row is unshared?|Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|
|**Merge**|What should happen when a primary table row is merged?|Cascade All<br />Cascade None|
|**Rollup View**|What is the desired behavior of the rollup view associated with this relationship? |Cascade All<br />Cascade Active<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade None|

<!-- TODO: I find no official docs related to rollup views, but plenty of hits online: https://www.google.com/search?q=Dynamics+365++%27rollup+view%27 -->



#### Type of Behavior options

Use the **Type of Behavior** column to choose between a set of standard behaviors or whether you want to configure them independently. 

|Option|Description|
|--|--|
|**Parental**|**Assign**: Cascade All<br />**Reparent**: Cascade All<br />**Share**: Cascade All<br />**Delete**: Cascade All<br />**Unshare**: Cascade All<br />**Merge**: Cascade None<br />**Rollup View**: Cascade None \| Cascade All<br />|
|**Referential**|**Assign**: Cascade None<br />**Reparent**: Cascade None<br />**Share**: Cascade None<br />**Delete**: Remove Link<br />**Unshare**: Cascade None<br />**Merge**: Cascade None<br />**Rollup View**: Cascade None \| Cascade All<br />|
|**Referential, Restrict Delete**|**Assign**: Cascade None<br />**Reparent**: Cascade None<br />**Share**: Cascade None<br />**Delete**: Restrict<br />**Unshare**: Cascade None<br />**Merge**: Cascade None<br />**Rollup View**: Cascade None \| Cascade All<br />|
|**Configurable Cascading**|You can configure the behavior you want for each action depending on the options available|

> [!NOTE]
> You may not be able to choose the **Parental** option if either of the tables already participate in an parental table relationship. More information: [Parental table relationships](#parental-table-relationships)
> 
> If you use **Configurable Cascading** to set the behaviors for the actions so that they match the behaviors for the actions associated with another **Type of Behavior**, when you save the relationship, the **Type of Behavior** is automatically set to the matching type.  



## Delete relationships

While [viewing table relationships](#view-table-relationships), select the table relationship you want to delete and click the ![Delete command](media/delete.gif) command.

Deleting the relationship will delete the lookup column on the related table.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to delete a relationship that has dependencies. For example, if you have added the lookup column to a form for the related table, you must remove the column from the form before you delete the relationship.

## Parental table relationships

Each pair of tables that are eligible to have a 1:N relationship can have multiple 1:N relationships between them. Yet usually only one of those relationships can be considered a parental table relationship.

A parental table relationship is any 1:N table relationship where one of the cascading options in the **Parental** column of the following table is true.

|Action|Parental|Not Parental|  
|------------|--------------|------------------|  
|**Assign**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Delete**|Cascade All|RemoveLink<br />Restrict|  
|**Reparent**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Share**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  
|**Unshare**|Cascade All<br />Cascade User-owned<br />Cascade Active|Cascade None|  

For example, if you create a new custom table and add a 1:N table relationship with the account table where your custom table is the related table, you can configure the actions for that table relationship to use the options in the **Parental** column. If you later add another 1:N table relationship with your custom table as the referencing table you can only configure the actions to use the options in the **Not Parental** column.

Usually this means that for each table pair there is only one parental relationship. There are some cases where the lookup on the related table may allow for a relationship to more than one type of table.

For example, if a table has a Customer lookup that can refer to either a contact or account table. There are two separate parental 1:N table relationships.

Any activity table has a similar set of parental table relationships for tables that can be associated using the regarding lookup column.

### Limitations on behaviors you can set
  
Because of parental relationships there are some limitations you should keep in mind when you define table relationships.  
  
- A custom table can’t be the primary table in a relationship with a related system table that cascades. This means you can’t have a relationship with any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned** between a primary custom table and a related system table.  
- No new relationship can have any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned** if the related table in that relationship already exists as a related table in another relationship that has any action set to **Cascade All**, **Cascade Active**, or **Cascade User-Owned**. This prevents relationships that create a multi-parent relationship.
