You can perform the following actions:

- **Edit Entity**: Open the selected form in the default organization, if the table supports this.
- **Text Search**: Perform a text search to filter displayed tables using the following table properties: <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.SchemaName>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.LogicalName>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.DisplayName>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.ObjectTypeCode>, or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.MetadataBase.MetadataId>.
- **Filter Entities**: Set simple criteria to view a sub-set of tables. All criteria are evaluated using AND logic.

    - **Text Search**: Perform a text search to filter displayed columns using the following attribute properties: <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.SchemaName>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.LogicalName>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.DisplayName>, or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.MetadataBase.MetadataId>.
    - **Filter Attributes**: Filter columns by any attribute property values.
    - **Filter Properties**: Filter the properties displayed for the selected attribute.

- **Keys**: If alternate keys are enabled for a table you can examine how they are configured.

    - **Edit Relationship**: Open the selected relationship form in the default organization, if the relationship supports this.  
    - **Text Search**: Perform a text search to filter displayed relationships using values relevant to the type of relationship.

> [!NOTE]
> When viewing the table detail properties, you'll see that many complex properties are expandable. The most useful value is displayed with a link that allows toggling to a more detailed view. The detailed view reflects the structure of the data if you were to retrieve it programmatically. The detailed view also reveals other relevant data that can be retrieved in the same area, for example, if any localized labels are present for **Display Name** properties.

> [!TIP]
> To copy text from the page, simply select the text and use the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut or the context menu **Copy** command.
