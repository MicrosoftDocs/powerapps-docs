# Configure Azure integration with Microsoft Dataverse

You can post the message request data for the current Dataverse core operation to cloud hosted applications listening on the Azure Service Bus. To enable this capability in Dataverse, perform the tasks detailed in this topic.

## Configure Azure For Dataverse integration

Because you will use SAS for authorization, you need to configure the rules and issuers of your Azure solution to allow a listener application to read the Dataverse message posted to the Azure Service Bus. In addition, you must configure the service bus rules to accept the Dataverse issuer claim. The recommended method to configure Azure is to use the Plug-in Registration tool (PRT).

For instructions on configuring authorization see [Tutorial: Configure Azure (SAS) for integration with Dataverse](walkthrough-configure-azure-sas-integration.md).

## Test Configuration

After configuring Azure integration, you will need to perform these additional tasks.

1. Write and register a listener application with a Azure Service Bus solution endpoint. For more information, see the Azure Service Bus [documentation](/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview).
1. Register an Azure aware plug-in or a Azure-aware custom workflow activity with Dataverse. More information: [Tutorial: Register an Azure-aware plug-in using the Plug-in Registration tool](walkthrough-register-azure-aware-plug-in-using-plug-in-registration-tool.md)
1. Perform the necessary Dataverse operation that triggers the plug-in or custom workflow activity to run.

If all of the preceding steps were performed correctly, a message containing the Dataverse data context should be sent to a Azure queue or topic and ultimately received by the listener application. You can navigate to the System Jobs grid in the Dataverse web application and check the status of the related System Job to see if the post to the Azure Service Bus succeeded. In case of errors, the message section of the System Job displays the error details.
