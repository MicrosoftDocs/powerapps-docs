# Use ITracingService in Plug-ins

## Symptoms

Debugging and/or troubleshooting plug-in issues or behaviors are complicated without rich and insightful logging or tracing.

<a name='guidance'></a>

## Guidance

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ITracingService> interface assists developers by recording run-time custom information as an aid in diagnosing the cause of code failures or unexpected behavior in plug-ins. Before writing to the tracing service, you must first extract the tracing service object from the passed execution context. Afterwards, simply add [Trace](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.itracingservice.trace) calls to your custom code where appropriate passing any relevant diagnostic information in that method call.

> [!NOTE]
> Trace logging using `ITracingService` interface works only when the plug-in is registered in Sandbox mode and you must enable trace logging to get run-time data. For more information see: [Logging and tracing](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/debug-plugin#logging-and-tracing)

```csharp
//Extract the tracing service for use in debugging sandboxed plug-ins.
ITracingService tracingService =
    (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));

// Obtain the execution context from the service provider.
IPluginExecutionContext context = (IPluginExecutionContext)
    serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));

// For this sample, execute the plug-in code only while the client is online. 
tracingService.Trace("AdvancedPlugin: Verifying the client is not offline.");
if (context.IsExecutingOffline || context.IsOfflinePlayback)
    return;

// The InputParameters collection contains all the data passed 
// in the message request.
if (context.InputParameters.Contains("Target") &&
    context.InputParameters["Target"] is Entity)
{
    // Obtain the target entity from the Input Parameters.
    tracingService.Trace("AdvancedPlugin: Getting the target entity from Input Parameters.");
    Entity entity = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];

    // Obtain the image entity from the Pre Entity Images.
    tracingService.Trace("AdvancedPlugin: Getting image entity from PreEntityImages.");
    Entity image = (Entity)context.PreEntityImages["Target"];
}
```

## Additional information

Tracing is especially useful to troubleshoot registered custom code as it is the only supported troubleshooting method for that scenario. Tracing is supported for `sandboxed` (partial trust) and full trust registered custom code and during synchronous or asynchronous execution. Tracing isnâ€™t supported for custom code that executes in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Outlook or other mobile client.
