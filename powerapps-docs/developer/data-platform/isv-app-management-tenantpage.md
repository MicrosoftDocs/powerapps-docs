## Installs by application

The column chart shown below displays the package unique names where versions of the selected app are displayed. All packages are selected by default, and all installed versions of all package (by tenant) are displayed on the graph. The user can select one or more packages and versions for further slicing and dicing. When the user selects a package, the version drop-down is updated to have the corresponding version of the selected package.

When hovering over any item of the graph, the following information is shown:

1. Application
1. Count
1. Package
1. Version

## Filtering the tenant page

ISVs can filter the tenant page using the filters available. For example, an ISV can filter to see the metrics at Package & Solution version, Geo, and Date range level.
