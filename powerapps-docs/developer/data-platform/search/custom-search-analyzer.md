# Configure Azure AI built-in analyzers for Dataverse Search

Dataverse search uses many different [Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) capabilities that include both index and search analyzers to return the best data based on what the user asks for. These built-in capabilities help to define how an index maps certain phrases or words to the best match to data in a column and a row in a table.

Examples include search strings that have special characters, or frequently used words (like '`of`' and '`or`')  that the back-end data engine removes from the search term when the query is processed.

Here are some examples where Dataverse search doesn't return an exact match because the data in the searched column isn't easily understood, or because certain characters are automatically removed or ignored based on the default analyzer used by Dataverse Search service.


|Examples|Desired|Actual|
|---------|---------|---------|
|`AB-84(q)(1)(c)`<br />or<br />`AB-84(1)(1)(-c)` |Exact match|Unwanted matches: Returns records with `AB`, `(1)`, or `(c)` in a column resulting in multiple records that aren't relevant.|
|`2.2.3.1`|Exact match|Unwanted matches: Returns records with `2.2`, `2.3.1`, `.2` resulting in multiple records that aren't relevant.|
|`PG-11.1`|Exact match|Unwanted matches: Returns records with `PG`, `-11`, `-11.1` resulting in multiple records that aren't relevant.|
|`"%mn" +"ABC-123"`|Exact match for: <br /> record has `mnABC-123`|Unwanted matches: <br /> record with `mn`<br />has a record with `ABC-123` but doesn't include `mn`|
|`"Inspector of brakes"`|Exact match|Unwanted match: `Inspector of boilers`|

To ensure Dataverse Search returns expected results, you might need to provide extra instructions via analyzers to match keywords and phrases to the data expected to be returned in a search term. The data is specific to a column and a table, and it's important to make sure Dataverse search uses the best analyzer, which is often a default Azure AI Search analyzer or a custom analyzer if needed.

## About analyzers

Dataverse search is built on top of the [Azure AI Search analyzers](/azure/search/search-analyzers), so if you're seeing results that you don't expect or would like to refine, make sure you have a good understanding of the Azure AI Search analyzers. Refer to [Analyzers for text processing in Azure AI Search](/azure/search/search-analyzers) for details and information on how Azure AI Search analyzers work in a search engine.

### Built-in analyzers

By default, Dataverse Search uses the [Microsoft language analyzer](/azure/search/index-add-language-analyzers?branch=main#supported-language-analyzers) based on the Dataverse organization's base language. If there's no Microsoft analyzer, Dataverse search uses the Lucene Analyzer. Both indexed documents and search terms go through the analysis during indexing and query processing.

In Dataverse Search, an analyzer is automatically invoked on all string or memo [columns marked as searchable](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization#select-searchable-fields-and-filters-for-each-table). You can't apply analyzers for any other type of column.

For your search terms and phrases, the Azure AI Search built-in analyzers might work for you. You can learn more about the available search analyzers that are available to be used: [Built-in analyzers](/azure/search/index-add-custom-analyzers#built-in-analyzers), or you can also see if the [available language analyzers](/azure/search/index-add-language-analyzers#supported-language-analyzers) work for you. Generally, you use a language analyzer when you have a column that is used to store data in a language that is different from your Dataverse base language.

To use one of the Azure AI Search built-in analyzers for a specific column, create a row in the [SearchAttributeSettings table](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md) set the [Name](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md#BKMK_name), [entityname](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md#BKMK_entityname), and [attributename](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md#BKMK_attributename) to be used and set the [settings](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md#BKMK_settings) to refer to a built-in search analyzer like `{"analyzer": "keyword"}`, or a language analyzer like `{ "analyzer": "it.microsoft"}`. [Learn how to set an analyzer for a column](#set-an-analyzer-for-a-column)

You can override the default for string columns. Alternative analyzers can be a [language analyzer](/azure/search/index-add-language-analyzers) for linguistic processing, a [custom analyzer](/azure/search/index-add-custom-analyzers), or a built-in analyzer from the list of [available analyzers](/azure/search/index-add-custom-analyzers#built-in-analyzers).


## Set an analyzer for a column

To apply a different analyzer for a Dataverse table column, there needs to be a row identifying that column in the [SearchAttributeSettings table](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md). By default, this table has no data.

Setting this property doesn't require writing code. Anyone with access to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and write access to the `SearchAttributeSettings` table can apply this change, but they need to take extra care not to create a duplicate row. If you want to use code to create this row, see [Edit SearchAttributeSettings table columns with code](#edit-searchattributesettings-table-columns-with-code).

> [!NOTE]
> Don't set an analyzer for the [primary name column of a table](../entity-metadata.md#primary-name). You can do this, but the results will not be reliable. Primary name columns are treated differently because most tables have them and they play a special role by providing the string value used to link to records within apps.
> 
> If you need to configure an analyzer that uses the data in the primary name column of a table, create a separate string column and copy the content of the primary name column into it. Set an analyzer on that column instead.

### Configure Power Apps to edit the SearchAttributeSettings table

Follow these steps to open the [SearchAttributeSettings table](../reference/entities/searchattributesettings.md) in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and edit the view to enable editing the **Name**, **attributename**, **entityname**, and **settings** columns.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you are in the environment you want to apply the changes by clicking on Environment in the page's header and selecting your environment.

1. Select **Tables** from the left navigation pane.
1. Select **All** tables.
1. In the top right corner, search for `searchattributesettings`.
1. Open the **SearchAttributeSettings** table.
1. Make sure when the table opens the **Name**, **attributename**, **entityname** and **settings** columns are visible. You can add them by selecting "**+18 more**" next to the **Name** column.
1. After selecting the columns, select **Save**.

This closes the dialog and the columns are visible on the page. After you save, the columns should be visible.

For more information, see [Table columns and data](../../../maker/data-platform/create-edit-entities-portal.md#table-columns-and-data)

### Edit SearchAttributeSettings table columns manually

The following table describes what to add to each column:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The combination of **entityname** and **attributename** values must be unique in the **SearchAttributeSettings** table. You must make sure that you don't enter duplicate rows for with the same values for these two columns. When a duplicate row exists Dataverse search will return an error when people perform a search.
>
> To avoid anyone unintentionally creating a duplicate row, you can add an alternate key to the `SearchAttributeSettings` table specifying the `entityname` and `attributename` columns in the key. [Learn to define alternate keys using Power Apps](../../../maker/data-platform/define-alternate-keys-portal.md)


|Name  |What to add|
|---------|---------|
|**Name**|The name can be anything that helps you identify the analyzer to configure.|
|**entityname**|The logical name of the table that has the column you're configuring.|
|**attributename**|The logical name of column of the table you want the analyzer used for your search terms or phrases.|
|**settings**|The JSON string that identifies the analyzer to configure. You should set only the `analyzer`, or the `indexanalyzer` and `searchanalyzer`. The values might look something like these: `{ "analyzer": "name_analyzer"}` or `{"indexanalyzer": "name_analyzer", "searchanalyzer": "name_analyzer"}`|



Changes made to the `SearchAttributeSettings` might take up to 15 minutes or more to appear in the search service. You can use the [Status message](statistics-status.md#status) to check the `EntityStatusInfo.lastdatasynctimestamp` value for the table to determine when the last sync completed.


### Edit SearchAttributeSettings table columns with code

The following code shows how to update the **SearchAttributeSettings** table columns with code and avoid creating duplicate columns or accidentally overwriting existing values.

{

   try
   {
      #region Check whether record exists

      Entity existingRecord = null;

      QueryExpression query = new("searchattributesettings")
      {
         ColumnSet = new ColumnSet(
            "searchattributesettingsid",
            "entityname",

         }
      };

      // Retrieve any matching records

      if (entityCollection.Entities.Count > 1)
      {

         string message = "More than one record is found in searchattributesettings ";
         message += $"with entityname {entityName} and attributename {attributeName}.";

         throw new Exception(message);
      }

      if (existingRecord != null)
      {
         string currentSettings = existingRecord.GetAttributeValue<string>("settings");
         Guid recordId = existingRecord.Id;

         if (!overwriteExisting)
         {

            message += $" entityname:{entityName}, attributename: {attributeName}";
            message += $" and settings: {settings}.";
            message += "Please update the value of overwriteExisting to true and ";
            message += " use the SetSearchAttributeSettings method again.";

            throw new Exception(message);
         }

         // Removing the existing record before replacing it
         service.Delete("searchattributesettings", recordId);
      }

      Entity newRecord = new("searchattributesettings")
      {
         Attributes = {
            { "entityname", entityName },
            { "attributename", attributeName },
            { "settings", settings }
         }
      };

      // Create the new record with the desired settings
      service.Create(newRecord);

   }
   catch (Exception)
   {
         throw;
   }
}
```

The following example shows how to use the `SetSearchAttributeSettings` method to specify a custom analyzer named `msdyn_search_remove_parenthesis_analyzer` for the [Contact.JobTitle column](../reference/entities/contact.md#BKMK_JobTitle).

```csharp
SetSearchAttributeSettings(
      service: service,
      entityName: "contact",
      attributeName: "jobtitle",
      settings: "{ \"analyzer\": \"msdyn_search_remove_parenthesis_analyzer\" }",
      overwriteExisting: true
   );
```

.SYNOPSIS
Sets the search attribute settings for a given entity and attribute.

.DESCRIPTION
The Set-SearchAttributeSettings function sets the search attribute settings for a specified entity 
and attribute. 
- It checks if an existing record is found in the searchattributesettings table. 
- If an existing record is found and the $overwriteExisting parameter is set to $false, 
it throws an error message. 
- If an existing record is found and the $overwriteExisting parameter is set to $true, 
it deletes the existing record and creates a new record with the updated settings. 
-If no existing record is found, it creates a new record with the specified settings.

.PARAMETER entityName
The name of the entity for which the search attribute settings need to be set.

.PARAMETER attributeName
The name of the attribute for which the search attribute settings need to be set.

.PARAMETER settings
The settings to be applied to the search attribute.

.PARAMETER overwriteExisting
Specifies whether to update an existing attribute setting if found. 
If set to $true, it removes the existing record and creates a new record with the updated settings. 
If set to $false and an existing record is found, it throws an error message.

.EXAMPLE
Connect 'https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com/'

Set-SearchAttributeSettings `
 -entityName 'contact' `
 -attributeName 'jobtitle' `
 -settings '{ "analyzer": "msdyn_search_remove_parenthesis_analyzer" }' `
 -overwriteExisting $true

This example sets the search attribute settings for the 'jobtitle' column of the 'contact' table. 
If an existing record is found, it removes the existing record and creates a new record with the 
updated settings.
