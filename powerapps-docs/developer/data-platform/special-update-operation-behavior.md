# Behavior of specialized update operations

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](includes/cc-terminology.md)]

There are several deprecated specialized messages that perform update operations. In earlier versions it was required to use these messages, but now the same operations should be performed using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> class with <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*>

[!INCLUDE [cc-legacy-update-messages](includes/cc-legacy-update-messages.md)]

More information: [Legacy update messages](org-service/entity-operations-update-delete.md#legacy-update-messages) 

This change introduced some special behaviors that should be noted for plug-ins and workflows.

## For plug-ins

When update requests are processed that include both owner fields plus other standard fields for business owned tables, plug-ins registered for the **Update** message in **PreOperation** and/or **PostOperation** stages execute once for all non-owner fields, and then once for the owner fields. Examples of owner fields would be `businessunit` and `manager` (for a [SystemUser table](reference/entities/systemuser.md)). Examples of business owned tables include [SystemUser](reference/entities/systemuser.md), [BusinessUnit](reference/entities/businessunit.md),[Equipment](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/equipment) and [Team](reference/entities/team.md).

When update requests are processed that include both state/status fields plus other standard fields, plug-ins registered for the **Update** message in **PreOperation** and/or **PostOperation** stages execute once for all non-state/status fields, and then once for the state/status fields.

In order for plug-in code to receive the full data changes of the update, you must register the plug-in in the **PreOperation** and then store relevant information in <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.SharedVariables> in the plug-in context for later plug-ins (in the pipeline) to consume.

## For workflows

When update requests are processed that include both owner fields plus other standard fields, workflows registered for the **Update** message execute once for all non-owner fields, and then once for the owner fields. Workflows registered for the **Assign** message by users continue to be triggered by updates to owner fields.

When update requests are processed that include both state/status fields plus other standard fields, workflows registered for the **Update** message execute once for all non-state/status fields, and then once for the state/status fields. Workflows registered for the **Change Status** step continue to be triggered by updates to state/status fields.
