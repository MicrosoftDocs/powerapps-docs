# Power Automate Embed Pay-as-you-go for ISVs (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Power Automate Embed Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) for ISVs allows verified publishers to leverage Power Platform into their solutions through an embedded licensing model that simplifies the customer experience. With this capability, customers can run flows using the connector without acquiring a separate Microsoft license and ISVs are billed on their existing Azure subscription for their customers' usage of their connector. 

## Sign-up for Power Automate Embed PAYG for ISVs

To enable this capability, ISVs can join the public preview program by completing the following form: [Join here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR9Bd5zmFN9VOlOkf4CNd94lUMVNTSTYzRTFRUDk1NFZaSVpUSUtEOUVFNi4u)
