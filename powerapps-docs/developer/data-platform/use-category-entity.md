# Use the Category table

Categorizing rows in Microsoft Dataverse helps you tag the rows so that you can easily search them. Use the  `Category` table to create and manage a hierarchical structure of categories in Dataverse, and then associate rows to one or more categories.  
  
A category can have multiple child categories, but a child category can have only one parent category. Deleting a parent `Category` row automatically deletes all its child rows and table associations. You define a parent category for a category using the `Category.ParentCategoryId` column.  
  
 Use the `Category.SequenceNumber` column to programmatically define the display order for categories in the hierarchy.  When you add a new category using the web client, it is automatically added after the last category in the hierarchy. You can also use the `Category.CategoryNumber` column to programmatically set or update a number for category to help you easily distinguish a group of categories. Category number can be set to any value programmatically, but is automatically set when you create a category using the web client based on the auto-numbering prefix specified by the administrator for categories in the web client (**Settings** > **Administration** > **Auto-Numbering** > **Categories** tab).  
  
 You can associate `Category` rows with system and custom table rows by using relationships and connections. A category row can be associated with different rows. For example, you can programmatically associate a `Category` row with an `Account`, `Contact` and `Incident` rows.
