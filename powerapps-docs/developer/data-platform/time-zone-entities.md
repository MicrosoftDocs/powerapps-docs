# Time zone tables

> [!NOTE]
> The *time zone rule* table is deprecated. The time conversion calculation is now provided by Microsoft Windows. Refer to this article for more information: [Microsoft policy in response to daylight saving time and time zone changes](https://support.microsoft.com/help/22803/daylight-saving-time).

The *time zone* tables can be used when you write code that works in multiple time zones. The following two read-only tables in Microsoft Dataverse contain time zone information:  
  
- The *time zone definition table* stores basic information about each supported time zone, including the time zone code and the standard time zone name.
  
- The *time zone localized name* table stores the localized time zone names.  
  
[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](includes/cc-terminology.md)]

The following table lists the messages that are related to time zones, but don’t refer to a specific table.  
  
|Message|Description|
