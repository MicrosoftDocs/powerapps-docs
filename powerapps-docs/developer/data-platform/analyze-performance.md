# Analyze plug-in performance

In addition to using a debugger and profiler to learn how your plug-in is performing at the code level, you can obtain metrics as to the overall performance of your registered plug-ins in an organization through [Microsoft Dataverse analytics](/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service).

Through the [Plug-in](/power-platform/admin/analytics-common-data-service#plug-ins) dashboard you can view metrics such as average execution time, failures, most active plug-ins, and more.
