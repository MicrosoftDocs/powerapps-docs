An activity party represents a person or group associated with an activity. An activity can have multiple activity parties.

## Activity Party Types  

 There are 12 activity party types in Microsoft Dataverse. The activity party type is stored as an integer value in the `ActivityParty.ParticipationTypeMask` column. The following table lists the different activity party types, the corresponding integer value for the `ActivityParty.ParticipationTypeMask` column, and the description.  
  
|Activity party type|Value|Description|  
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|Sender|1|Specifies the sender.|  
|ToRecipient|2|Specifies the recipient in the To field.|  
|CCRecipient|3|Specifies the recipient in the Cc field.|  
|BccRecipient|4|Specifies the recipient in the Bcc field.|  
|RequiredAttendee|5|Specifies a required attendee.|  
|OptionalAttendee|6|Specifies an optional attendee.|  
|Organizer|7|Specifies the activity organizer.|

## Activity Party types available for each activity  
 
Not all activity party types are available for each activity in Dataverse, except for a custom activity. A custom activity supports all activity party types. You can associate an activity party type for an activity by using the respective column of an activity. For example, to associate an `Organizer` activity party type with an appointment activity, you must specify a value or an array of values of the `ActivityParty` type in the `Appointment.Organizer` column.  
  
 To control which email address should be used for sending emails to the activity party, or for replying to emails from the activity party, set the `ActivityParty.AddressUsed` column.  
  
 The following table lists the activity party types that are supported for each activity, and the corresponding activity properties to specify those activity party types.  
  
|Activity entity name|Supported activity party type|Activity attribute|  
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|  
|Appointment|OptionalAttendee<br />Organizer<br />RequiredAttendee|Appointment.OptionalAttendees<br />Appointment.Organizer<br />Appointment.RequiredAttendees|  
|CampaignActivity|Sender|CampaignActivity.Partners<br />CampaignActivity.From|  
|CampaignResponse|Customer|CampaignResponse.Customer<br />CampaignResponse.Partner<br />CampaignResponse.From|  
|Chat|ChatParticipant|None|
