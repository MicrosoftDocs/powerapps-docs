# Connector certification

If you own a service or API&mdash;or you've built a custom connector that you want to connect to Power Apps, Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, or Power Query&mdash;you need to submit your connector to Microsoft for certification. 

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](includes/cc-terminology.md)]

Connector certification is now included in ISV Studio, so you can use it to manage and track your connector certification submission. More information: [Submit your connector for Microsoft certification](/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification)

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start submitting your connector for certification, see [Instructions on submitting your connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission) for submission requirements.

**To certify your custom connector through ISV Studio**

1. In ISV Studio, select **Connector certification** in the leftmost pane.

2. Select the type of connector to certify, and then select **Submit**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Connector certification.](media/connector-certification-submit.png "Connector certification")

3. On the **Connector submission** page, read the agreement details, select the **Accept terms** check box, and then select **Next**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Consent form.](media/connector-certification-consent-form.png "Consent form")

4. Select **Choose a file** to upload the custom connector from your local machine. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Choose file.](media/connector-certification-choose-file.png "Choose file")

5. Enter the required details, and then select **Submit for review**. 
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Submit for review.](media/connector-certification-submit-for-review.png "Submit for review")

After you submit your connector for review, you'll receive an email from Microsoft.
