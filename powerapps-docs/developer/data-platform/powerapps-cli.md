# What is Microsoft Power Apps CLI? 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Effective May 2021, *Microsoft Power Apps CLI* is rebranded to *Microsoft Power Platform CLI*. More information: [Blog: Microsoft Power Platform is the best way for teams to build together](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/25/microsoft-power-platform-is-the-best-way-for-teams-to-build-together/).<br/><br/>
We will soon update the docs to reflect this change.

Microsoft Power Apps CLI is a simple, single-stop developer command-line interface that empowers developers and ISV to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform related to environment lifecycle features, authenticate and work with Dataverse environments, solution packages, portals, code components, and so on.  

## Install Power Apps CLI

To get Power Apps CLI, do the following:

1. Install [Power Apps CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).
1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update the Power Apps CLI tooling to the latest version using this command (not applicable for Visual Studio Code Extension):

    ```CLI
    pac install latest
    ```


> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, Power Apps CLI is supported only on Windows 10.
> - Power Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code is in public preview and works on both Windows 10 and macOS. 

## Install Power Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code

You can also install the [Power Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/ppcvscode) which installs the Power Apps CLI for use within Visual Studio Code. The Power Platform extension makes it easy to manage Power Platform environments and allows the developer to create, build packages, deploy solutions, and portals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Power Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code is in public preview. 
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Power Apps CLI version that is included with this extension may also be a public preview version. We recommend you to install the latest version using the steps mentioned above.

### Canvas

Commands for working with canvas app source files. Edit, manage, and collaborate on your app outside of Power Apps Studio with tools such as VS Code and GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> The Canvas commands are in public preview. They may not be available in the version of the Power Apps CLI that you are using currently. 

#### Parameters

|Property Name|Description|Example|
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| unpack | Unpacks the `.msapp`  source file.<br/> Download the `.msapp` file from Power Apps Studio by navigating to **File** > **Save as** > **This computer**.<br/>  If the **sources** parameter is not specified, a directory with the same name and location as the `.msapp` file is used with `_src` suffix.  | `pac canvas unpack --msapp HelloWorld.msapp --sources MyHelloWorldFiles`<br/>`pac canavs unpack --msapp HelloWorld.msapp`<br/>*unpacks to default* `HelloWorld_src` *directory* |
| pack | Creates an `.msapp` file from the previously unpacked source files. <br/>The result can be opened in Power Apps Studio by navigating to **File** > **Open** > **Browse**.<br/> The source files can be edited and managed with external tools after being unpacked, such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub. | `pac canvas pack --sources MyHelloWorldFiles --msapp HelloWorld.msapp` |

#### Folder structure

Unpack and pack use the following folder structure:

- **\src** - Control and component files. This contains the sources.
   - ***\*.fx.yaml*** - The formulas extracted from the `control.json` file.  *This is the place to edit your formulas.*
   - ***CanvasManifest.json*** - A manifest file that contains the information normally present in the header, properties, and publishInfo.
   - ***\*.json*** - The raw `control.json` file.
   - ***\EditorState\*.editorstate.json*** - Cached information for studio to use.
- **\DataSources** - All the data sources used by the app.
- **\Connections** - Connection instances saved with the app and used when reloading into the studio. 
- **\Assets** - Media files embedded in the app.
- **\pkgs** - A downloaded copy of external references, such as templates, API definition files, and component libraries. These are similar to NuGet/NPM references. 
- **\other** - All miscellaneous files needed to recreate the `.msapp`.
   - ***entropy.json*** - Volatile elements (like timestamps) are extracted to this file. This helps reduce noisy differences in other files while ensuring that we can still round trip.
   - Holds other files from the msapp, such as what is in \references.

#### File format

The `.fx.yaml` files uses a subset of [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). Similar to Excel, all the expressions should begin with an `=` sign. More information: [Power Fx YAML Formula Grammar](/power-platform/power-fx/yaml-formula-grammar).

#### Merging changes with Power Apps Studio

When merging changes, that are made in two different studio sessions:

- Ensure that all the control names are unique. For example, inserting a button in two different sessions can result in two `Button1` controls. We recommend to name the controls soon after you create them. The tool doesn't accept two controls with the same name.  
- For these files, merge them as you normally do:
   - \src\*.fx.yaml
- If there are conflicts or errors, you can delete these files:
   - \src\editorstate\*.json  - These files contain optional information in studio.
   - \other\entropy.json  
- For any conflict in these files, itâ€™s ok to accept the latest version: 
   - \checksum.json
- If there are any merge conflicts under these paths, it is not safe to merge. Let us know if this happens often and we will work on restructuring the file format to avoid conflicts.
   - \Connections\*
   - \DataSources\*
   - \pkgs\*
   - CanvasManifest.json
