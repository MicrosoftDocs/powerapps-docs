# What is Microsoft Power Platform CLI? 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

> [!NOTE] 
> Effective June 2021, Microsoft Power Apps CLI is rebranded to Microsoft Power Platform CLI. More information: [Blog: Microsoft Power Platform is the best way for teams to build together](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/25/microsoft-power-platform-is-the-best-way-for-teams-to-build-together/)

Microsoft Power Platform CLI is a simple, one-stop developer CLI that empowers developers and ISVs to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform related to environment lifecycle features, and to authenticate and work with Microsoft Dataverse environments, solution packages, portals, code components, and so on.  

## Install Microsoft Power Platform CLI

You can use either of the following ways to install Microsoft Power Platform CLI.

### Using Power Platform VS Code Extension

To install Microsoft Power Platform CLI using Visual Studio Code Extension:

1. Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Select **Extensions** icon from the **Activity** panel. In the search bar, enter **Power Platform VS Code Extension**.
1. Select **Install**. Once the installation is finished, restart your Visual Studio Code to see the extension within the **Terminal** window.

   > ![VS code extension install.](media/power-platform-vs-code-extension-install.png "VS code extension install")
   
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Power Platform Visual Studio Code Extension updates automatically. 

1. You can also initiate the intiate the install into Visual Studio Code directly from [Marketplace]( https://aka.ms/ppcvscode) and it will launch Visual Studio Code and commence the extension installation 

### Standalone Power Platform CLI

To install standalone Power Platform CLI:

1. Download and install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update Microsoft Power Platform CLI tooling to the latest version by using this command (not applicable for Power Platform VS Code Extension):
    ```CLI
    pac install latest

    ```
> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, Microsoft Power Platform CLI is supported only on Windows 10.
> - Power Platform VS Code Extension is in public preview, and works on both Windows 10 and macOS.

### Canvas

Commands for working with canvas app source files. Edit, manage, and collaborate on your app outside of Power Apps Studio with tools such as VS Code and GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> The Canvas commands are in public preview. They may not be available in the version of Microsoft Power Platform CLI that you're using currently. 

#### Parameters

|Property name|Description|Example|
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| unpack | Unpacks the `.msapp`  source file.<br/> Download the `.msapp` file from Power Apps Studio by navigating to **File** > **Save as** > **This computer**.<br/>  If the **sources** parameter is not specified, a directory with the same name and location as the `.msapp` file is used with `_src` suffix.  | `pac canvas unpack --msapp HelloWorld.msapp --sources MyHelloWorldFiles`<br/>`pac canavs unpack --msapp HelloWorld.msapp`<br/>*unpacks to default* `HelloWorld_src` *directory* |
| pack | Creates an `.msapp` file from the previously unpacked source files. <br/>The result can be opened in Power Apps Studio by navigating to **File** > **Open** > **Browse**.<br/> After being unpacked, the source files can be edited and managed with external tools such as Visual Studio Code and GitHub. | `pac canvas pack --sources MyHelloWorldFiles --msapp HelloWorld.msapp` |

#### Folder structure

Unpack and pack properties use the following folder structure:

- **\src** - Control and component files. This contains the sources.
   - ***\*.fx.yaml*** - The formulas extracted from the `control.json` file.<!--note from editor: Maybe the Note format would be good to use here?-->
    >[!NOTE]
    >This is the place to edit your formulas.
   - ***CanvasManifest.json*** - A manifest file that contains the information normally present in the header, properties, and publishInfo.
   - ***\*.json*** - The raw `control.json` file.
   - ***\EditorState\*.editorstate.json*** - Cached information for Power Apps Studio to use.
- **\DataSources** - All the data sources used by the app.
- **\Connections** - Connection instances saved with the app and used when reloading into Power Apps Studio. 
- **\Assets** - Media files embedded in the app.
- **\pkgs** - A downloaded copy of external references, such as templates, API definition files, and component libraries. These are similar to NuGet/NPM references. 
- **\other** - All miscellaneous files needed to re-create the `.msapp`.
   - ***entropy.json*** - Volatile elements (like timestamps) are extracted to this file. This helps reduce noisy differences in other files while ensuring that we can still round-trip.
   - Holds other files from the msapp, such as what's in \references.

#### File format

The `.fx.yaml` files use a subset of [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). Similar to Excel, all expressions should begin with an equal sign `=`. More information: [Power Fx YAML Formula Grammar](/power-platform/power-fx/yaml-formula-grammar)

#### Merging changes with Power Apps Studio

When merging changes that are made in two different Power Apps Studio sessions:

- Ensure that all the control names are unique. For example, inserting a button in two different sessions can result in two `Button1` controls. We recommend that you name the controls soon after you create them. The tool doesn't accept two controls with the same name.  
- For these files, merge them as you normally do:
   - \src\*.fx.yaml
- If there are conflicts or errors, you can delete these files:
   - \src\editorstate\*.json  - These files contain optional information in Power Apps Studio.
   - \other\entropy.json  
- For any conflicts in these files, it's ok to accept the latest version: 
   - \checksum.json
- If there are any merge conflicts under these paths, it isn't safe to merge. Let us know if this happens often; we'll work on restructuring the file format to avoid conflicts.
   - \Connections\*
   - \DataSources\*
   - \pkgs\*
   - CanvasManifest.json
