# What is Microsoft Power Apps CLI? 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Effective May 2021, *Microsoft Power Apps CLI* is rebranded to *Microsoft Power Platform CLI*. More information: [Blog: Microsoft Power Platform is the best way for teams to build together](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/25/microsoft-power-platform-is-the-best-way-for-teams-to-build-together/).<br/><br/>
We will soon update the docs to reflect this change.

Microsoft Power Apps CLI is a simple, single-stop developer command-line interface that empowers developers and ISV to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform related to environment lifecycle features, authenticate and work with Dataverse environments, solution packages, portals, code components, and so on.  

## Install Power Apps CLI

To get Power Apps CLI, do the following:

1. Install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 or higher.

1. Install [.NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462). 

1. If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of these options:
   - Option 1: Install [Visual Studio 2017](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) or later.
   - Option 2: Install [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current) and then install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

1. Install [Power Apps CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update the Power Apps CLI tooling to the latest version using this command:

    ```CLI
    pac install latest
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Power Apps CLI is supported only on Windows 10.
