# What is Microsoft Power Platform CLI?

> [!NOTE]
> Effective June 2021, Microsoft Power Apps CLI is rebranded to Microsoft Power Platform CLI. More information: [Blog: Microsoft Power Platform is the best way for teams to build together](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/25/microsoft-power-platform-is-the-best-way-for-teams-to-build-together/)<p/>Microsoft Power Platform CLI is now available for use in the GCC and GCC High (US Sovereign cloud) regions. Use the command `pac auth create` for help on the `--cloud` parameter to find out about supported US Sovereign cloud environments.

Microsoft Power Platform CLI is a simple, one-stop developer CLI that empowers developers and ISVs to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform related to environment lifecycle, authentication, and work with Microsoft Dataverse environments, solution packages, portals, code components, and so on.  

## Install Microsoft Power Platform CLI

You can use either of the following ways to install Microsoft Power Platform CLI.

### Standalone Power Platform CLI

To install standalone Power Platform CLI, follow these steps.

<!--1. Install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 LTS because it seems to be the most stable.

1. Install [.NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462). 

1. If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of these options:
   - Option 1: Install [Visual Studio 2017](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) or later.
   - Option 2: Install [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) and then install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)-->
1. Download and install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update Microsoft Power Platform CLI tooling to the latest version by using this command (not applicable for Power Platform VS Code Extension):

    ```dotnetcli
    pac install latest
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > - Currently, Microsoft Power Platform standalone CLI is supported only on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
   > - Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code is available on Windows 10, Windows 11, Linux, and MacOS.

### Using Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code

Follow these steps to install Microsoft Power Platform CLI using Visual Studio Code.

1. Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Select the **Extensions** icon from the **Activity** panel. In the search bar, enter **Power Platform Tools**.
1. Select **Install**. Once the installation is finished, restart Visual Studio Code to see the extension within the **Terminal** window.

   > ![VS code extension install.](media/power-platform-vs-code-extension-install.png "VS code extension install")

   > [!NOTE]
   > Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code updates automatically. 

1. Optionally, you can initiate the install into Visual Studio Code directly from [Marketplace]( https://aka.ms/ppcvscode) and it will launch Visual Studio Code and commence the extension installation.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Launch install from Marketplace.](media/marketplace-install.png "Launch install from Marketplace")

You can also do a side-load install into Visual Studio Code by downloading the extension from the [Marketplace](https://aka.ms/ppcvscode).

## Side-load install of Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code

In some organizations, downloading or initiating an install over the web is prohibited. Most cases, the organization download the installation media and stores it in a secure location and verify that it is working according to their standards, before it is distributed within the organization. To support this paradigm of installation, you can go to the [Marketplace](https://aka.ms/ppcvscode) and instead of pressing the install button, press the download extension.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Download the extension.](media/side-load-install-1.png "Download the extension")

This is will download a file with a .vsix extension on to your workstation.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Extension file downloaded.](media/side-load-install-2.png "Downloaded extension")

Launch Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** icon, click on the ellipsis on the **Extensions** side bar, and then select **Install from VSIX**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Initiate install with the downloaded file.](media/side-load-install-3.png "Install from VSIX")

## Successful installation

Once the installation is successful, you will need to restart Visual Studio Code, upon which you will see the following notification.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Install notification ](media/installation-success-1.png "Install notification")

On the **Activity** bar you will notice the icon for the Power Platform Tools.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Power Platform Tools icon ](media/installation-success-3.png "icon")

The final check would be to launch the terminal window and type `pac`.
