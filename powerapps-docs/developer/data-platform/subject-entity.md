# Subject entity

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

A *subject* categorizes entity records, such as articles and sales literature. By using subjects, you can create a hierarchy of topics to organize and maintain information in Microsoft Dataverse. The information organized in the subject tree can be used by any entity in Dataverse. The `Subject` entity categorizes the following:  
  
- Knowledge base articles  
  
- Incidents (cases)  
  
- Product catalog items  
  
- Sales literature  
  
The content organization of the knowledge base is displayed in the subject tree. The subject tree provides organizational consistency across entities. It makes the system easier for customer service, sales, and marketing to use. Frequently, the products for an organization determine the subject tree. However, you can use subject entity records to create nodes at the root level that are not shared.
