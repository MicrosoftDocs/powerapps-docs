# Delete audit data

You may need to delete audit data because:

- You need to comply with a request from a customer to delete their history.
- You want to use less log capacity space.

Dataverse provides the following messages to delete audit history data:

|Message|Description|
|---------|---------|
|`DeleteRecordChangeHistory`|Deletes all the audit change history records for a particular record.|
|`BulkDelete`|Asynchronously deletes records identified by a query. This message can be used to delete large numbers of audit records without blocking other activities.|
|`DeleteAuditData`|For customers using customer managed encryption keys this message deletes all audit data records up until a specified end date.|

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot directly delete records in the [Auditing (Audit) table](../reference/entities/audit.md)

## Delete the change history for a record

Use the `DeleteRecordChangeHistoryRequest` message to delete all the audit change history records for a particular record. This lets you delete the audit change history for a record instead of deleting all the audit records for a date range. 

To delete the audit change history for a record, you must have the System Administrator security role or a security role with the `prvDeleteRecordChangeHistory` privilege. More information: [Example: Check whether a user has a privilege](../security-access-coding.md#example-check-whether-a-user-has-a-privilege)

### DeleteRecordChangeHistoryRequest Message

Specify the record using the `Target` parameter. The `DeletedEntriesCount` property of the response tells you how many audit records were deleted.

# [Web API](#tab/webapi)

The following example uses the <xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.RetrieveRecordChangeHistory?text=DeleteRecordChangeHistoryRequest Action> to delete the audited data changes for an account record.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/DeleteRecordChangeHistory HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json  
OData-MaxVersion: 4.0  
OData-Version: 4.0
If-None-Match: null

 "Target": {
  "@odata.type": "Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.account",
  "accountid": "611e7713-68d7-4622-b552-85060af450bc"
 }
}
```

**Response**

```http

OData-Version: 4.0

{
 "@odata.context": "[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.DeleteRecordChangeHistoryResponse",

## Use BulkDelete to delete audit data

You can delete audit records your organization no longer needs to retain to comply with internal and external auditing requirements using the `BulkDelete` message. Deleting audit data using bulk delete will run in the background and allows you to define recurrence patterns, start time, and other parameters that help you to manage your bulk deletion jobs.

### BulkDelete Message

# [Web API](#tab/webapi)

The following example deletes audit records with an action value of 64 (User Access via Web) from the audit log. You can modify your bulk delete job according to your needs.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/BulkDelete HTTP/1.1  
Accept: application/json  
OData-MaxVersion: 4.0  
OData-Version: 4.0

   "EntityName": "audit",
   "Criteria": {
    "FilterOperator": "And",

      "Values": [
       {
        "Type": "System.String",
        "Value": "64"
       }

 "ToRecipients": [],
 "CCRecipients": [],
 "RecurrencePattern": "",
 "StartDateTime": "2022-02-02T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Response**

```HTTP

Content-Type: application/json; odata.metadata=minimal
OData-Version: 4.0

{

## Delete the change history for a date range

If you use customer managed encryption keys you can delete `audit` records for a date range using the `DeleteAuditData` message. Audit data records are deleted sequentially from the oldest to the newest.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you are using customer managed encryption keys you should consider using Bulk Delete rather than `DeleteAuditData` message. See [Use BulkDelete to delete audit data](#use-bulkdelete-to-delete-audit-data)

The `DeleteAuditData` message will delete all audit data in those partitions where the end date is before the date specified in the `EndDate` property. Any empty partitions are also deleted. However, neither the current (active) partition nor the `audit` records in that active partition can be deleted by using this request or any other request.

New partitions are automatically created by the Dataverse platform on a quarterly basis each year. This functionality is non-configurable and cannot be changed. You can obtain the list of partitions using the `RetrieveAuditPartitionList` message. If the end date of any partition is later than the current date, you cannot delete that partition or any `audit` records in it.
