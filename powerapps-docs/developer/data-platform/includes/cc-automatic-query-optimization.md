## Automatic query optimization
Dataverse is designed to deliver reliable performance at scale, even as it handles complex operations behind the scenes. Many customer interactions with Dataverse result in SQL queries being executed internally. While these operations are abstracted away from the user, they are continuously optimized by intelligent systems built into the platform. While customers may occasionally experience brief periods of slowness, these are typically transient and self-resolving.

This doesn't require any manual tuning, configurations, settings changes from customers. In is enabled by default for all customers.
