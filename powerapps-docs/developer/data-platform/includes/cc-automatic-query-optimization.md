## Automatic query optimization

Don't be surprised when the performance of a slow query improves without any change on your part. Dataverse actively monitors data retrieval operations to improve performance. When a specific query using standard tables performs poorly, Dataverse might automatically make changes that improve the performance of the query. This behavior might make certain performance issues appear transient because they can't be reproduced later.  

Automatic query optimization doesn't require any configuration. It's enabled by default for everyone.
