> This example method includes some logic to try to get the [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) of the file using the [FileExtensionContentTypeProvider.TryGetContentType(String, String) Method](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles.FileExtensionContentTypeProvider.TryGetContentType%2A) if it isn't provided. If not found it will set the mime type to `application/octet-stream`.
