# Community tools for Microsoft Dataverse

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The Power Apps community creates tools! 

Many of the most popular ones are distributed in the [XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/). XrmToolBox is a Windows application that connects to Dataverse, providing tools to ease customization, configuration and operation tasks. It is shipped with more than 30 plugins to make administration, customization or configuration tasks easier and less time consuming. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tools created by the community are not supported by Microsoft. If you have questions or issues with community tools, contact the publisher of the tool.

The following is a selected list of community tools distributed via the XrmToolBox that you can use with Dataverse.
