# Install failures


[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

As an ISV, you need data like failure details or failure count to quickly resolve the issues for the customers. You can use the install failures feature to get the install failures data. 

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](includes/cc-terminology.md)]

With the install failures feature, you can see the install failures data by date, GEO, package, and by solution version. You can also see the failure details on the install failures dashboard.
