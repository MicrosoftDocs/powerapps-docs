# Roadmap to Dataverse (preview)

In this article, we explore basic information about Dataverse that you need to know in order to be successful when working with Dataverse. We also provide links to more detailed information. Dataverse capabilities are extensive, however, you can explore these additional capabilities at your own pace should you choose to do so.

## Tables and messages

<!-- about OOB tables and messages-->

## Security

<!-- Access to data -->

## Customizations and extensions

<!-- customized and custom tables, plug-ins, workflow activities -->

## Web API

The SDK provides a Python programming interface that internally calls the Dataverse [Web API](../../data-platform/webapi/overview.md). You can invoke Web API functions and actions from within your Python program. However, the SDK provides a more natural Python programming syntax as expected by developers and data scientists.

The `DataverseClient` class provides a simplified interface to OData 2.0 authorization as required by the Web API.
