# Write Telemetry to your Application Insights resource using ILogger (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use this capability you must first enable the Application Insights integration preview feature. More information: [Preview: Analyze model-driven apps and Microsoft Dataverse telemetry with Application Insights](/power-platform/admin/analyze-telemetry)<p/>
> There is presently no support of `ILogger` within a plug-in profiling/debug session of the Plug-in Registration tool or the Power Platform Tools extension for Visual Studio.

When you enable Application Insights for your organization, any plug-ins written using the [ILogger Interface](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.plugintelemetry.ilogger) provided in the Organization Service SDK assemblies will write telemetry to your Application Insights resource.

The Dataverse and model-driven app telemetry data you receive when using the Application Insights integration is captured by the Dataverse platform and exported to your Application Insights resource. This means there will be some latency between the time it was captured and when it becomes available to you in Application Insights.  Because this telemetry is gathered by Microsoft, you do not need to write any code to enable it.

Telemetry data that comes from plug-ins using the ILogger interface is different in two ways:

- This telemetry is written directly to your Application Insights resource and is never sent to Microsoft.
    - This means there will be less latency in viewing this data.
- You must update your plug-in code to use the ILogger interface.

Using ILogger will provide true telemetry data and is intended to work together with the existing Plug-in Trace Logs written using the [ITracingService Interface](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.itracingservice). The following table compares the capabilities:


|Criteria |ILogger for Application Insights  |ITracingService Trace for Plug-in Trace Logs  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Intended use|Capture telemetry over time for analysis and debugging.|While developing and debugging plug-ins|
|How long data is stored|According to your Application Insights data retention period, which is 90 days by default|24 hours|
|Available|Only for organizations that have subscribed to Application Insights integration.|For any organization when Plug-in tracing is enabled.|
|Amount of data|Each log message can pass a String value.|Only 10kb of text can be written for each plug-in execution. Any more will be truncated.|
|Available in runtime errors|No|Available in model-driven app client errors and as annotations in Web API. More information: [Include additional details with errors](webapi/compose-http-requests-handle-errors.md#include-additional-details-with-errors)|

You should continue to use the [ITracingService.Trace](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.itracingservice.trace) to write to the Plug-in Trace Log table when needed. Not every organization will enable Application Insights. If your plug-in code uses the ILogger interface and the organization does not have Application Insights integration enabled, nothing will be written. So, it is important to continue to use the ITracingService Trace method in your plug-ins. Plug-in trace logs continue to be an important way to capture data while developing and debugging plug-ins, but they were never intended to provide telemetry data. More information: [Plug-ins: Tracing and logging](logging-tracing.md)

You should use [ILogger](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.plugintelemetry.ilogger) because it will allow for telemetry about what happens within a plug-in to be integrated with the larger scope of data captured with the Application Insights integration. The Application Insights integration will tell you when a plug-in executes, how long it takes to run and whether it makes any external http requests, but Microsoft cannot add any telemetry code within the plug-ins that people write to extend the behavior of the platform.

If you are an ISV with a product that includes plug-ins, your customers who enable Application Insights will appreciate being able to see what is going on within your plug-ins and this data may help you support them if there are issues. But data captured using ILogger will only be sent to the subscribing customerâ€™s resource. You will only be able to see data captured for your own environments when you have Application Insights enabled.

## Use ILogger

ILogger is a common interface for capturing log information. The implementation provided with the Organization Service SDK assemblies provides common methods to support establishing a scope and different levels of logging.  There is currently no setting to control what level of logs are written. The levels can be used within Application Insights to filter which logs to view.

The following is an example of a plug-in using both ILogger and ITracingService.Trace.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.PluginTelemetry;
using System;
using System.Net.Http;

namespace ILoggerExample
{
    public class AccountPostOperation : IPlugin
    {
        private string webAddress;
        public AccountPostOperation(string config)
        {

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(config))
            {
                webAddress = "https://www.bing.com";
            }
            else
            {
                webAddress = config;
            }
        }


        public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
        {
            ITracingService tracingService =
               (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));

            ILogger logger = (ILogger)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ILogger));

            IPluginExecutionContext context = (IPluginExecutionContext)
               serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));

            try
            {
                string startExecMsg = "Start execution of AccountPostOperation";
                logger.LogInformation(startExecMsg);
                tracingService.Trace(startExecMsg);

                Entity entity = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];
                if (entity.LogicalName != "account")
                {

                    string wrongEntityMsg = "Plug-in registered for wrong entity {0}";
                    logger.LogWarning(wrongEntityMsg, entity.LogicalName);
                    tracingService.Trace(wrongEntityMsg, entity.LogicalName);
                    return;
                }

                string activityMsg = "Callback";

                using (logger.BeginScope(activityMsg))
                {
                    tracingService.Trace(activityMsg);

                    string startTaskMsg = "Start Task Creation";
                    logger.LogInformation(startTaskMsg);
                    tracingService.Trace(startTaskMsg);

                    Entity followup = new Entity("task");
                    followup["subject"] = "Send e-mail to the new customer.";
                    followup["description"] =
                        "Follow up with the customer. Check if there are any new issues that need resolution.";
                    followup["scheduledstart"] = DateTime.Now.AddDays(7);
                    followup["scheduledend"] = DateTime.Now.AddDays(7);
                    followup["category"] = context.PrimaryEntityName;

                    // Refer to the account in the task activity.
                    if (context.OutputParameters.Contains("id"))
                    {
                        Guid regardingobjectid = new Guid(context.OutputParameters["id"].ToString());
                        string regardingobjectidType = "account";

                        followup["regardingobjectid"] =
                        new EntityReference(regardingobjectidType, regardingobjectid);

                    }

                    // Obtain the organization service reference.
                    IOrganizationServiceFactory serviceFactory = (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider
                    .GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));

                    IOrganizationService service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);
                    //Create the task
                    service.Create(followup);

                    string endTaskMsg = "Task creation completed";
                    logger.LogInformation(endTaskMsg);
                    tracingService.Trace(endTaskMsg);
                }

                string outBoundScope = "OutboundCall";

                using (logger.BeginScope(outBoundScope))
                {

                    string outboundStartMsg = "Outbound call started";
                    logger.LogInformation(outboundStartMsg);
                    tracingService.Trace(outboundStartMsg);

                    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
                    {
                        client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(15000); //15 seconds
                        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.ConnectionClose = true; //Set KeepAlive to false

                        HttpResponseMessage response = client
                            .GetAsync(webAddress)
                            .GetAwaiter()
                            .GetResult(); //Make sure it is synchronous

                        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

                        string responseText = response.Content
                            .ReadAsStringAsync()
                            .GetAwaiter()
                            .GetResult(); //Make sure it is synchronous

                        string shortResponseText = responseText.Substring(0, 20);

                        logger.LogInformation(shortResponseText);
                        tracingService.Trace(shortResponseText);

                        string outboundEndMsg = "Outbound call ended successfully";

                        logger.LogInformation(outboundEndMsg);
                        tracingService.Trace(outboundEndMsg);

                    }

                }

            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                string errMsg = "Plugin failed";
                logger.LogError(e, errMsg);
                tracingService.Trace($"{errMsg}:{e.Message}");
                throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException(e.Message, e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When this plug-in is registered on a synchronous `PostOperation` step for the `Create` of an `account` entity, you can use Application Insights Logs to view the output within a few minutes. You can use [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](/azure/data-explorer/kql-quick-reference) to query the results.

You can filter items for a single operation using the `operation_ParentId` that represents the request id of the response header.

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-trace-operation_parentid.png" alt-text="Filter items for a single operation using the operation_ParentId .":::

The corresponding plug-in trace log entry looks like this:

```
Start execution of AccountPostOperation
Callback
Start Task Creation
Task creation completed
Outbound call started
<!doctype html><html
Outbound call ended successfully 
```

Note that the information set with the [BeginScope Method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.plugintelemetry.ilogger.beginscope) is not visible in the rows returned in Application Insights. This data is set within the `customDimensions` of logs added within that scope. You can use this query to show the logs within the scope.

This query will limit the results to the logs added during the `Callback` scope

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-trace-callback-scope.png" alt-text="Query will limit the results to the logs added during the Callback scope.":::

And this query will limit the results to the logs added during the `OutboundCall` scope:

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-trace-outboundcall-scope.png" alt-text="query will limit the results to the logs added during the OutboundCall scope.":::

## Logging Exceptions

At the bottom of the the plug-in code example above, the following code uses [LogError](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.plugintelemetry.ilogger.logerror) to log a caught exception and throws an [InvalidPluginExecutionException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.invalidpluginexecutionexception):

```csharp
catch (Exception e)
{
    string errMsg = "Plugin failed";
    logger.LogError(e, errMsg);
    tracingService.Trace($"{errMsg}:{e.Message}");
    throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException(e.Message, e);
}
```

Using the plug-in code above, you can cause an exception by passing an invalid value to step registration configuration data. In this example, the value is `NOT_A_URL`.

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-cause-error.png" alt-text="Causing an error by entering invalid configuration value in plug-in step registration.":::

This will override the default value (`https://www.bing.com`) and cause the outbound call to fail. 

There is nothing wrong with the request that a client may send:

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/accounts HTTP/1.1
Prefer: odata.include-annotations="*"
Authorization: Bearer [REDACTED]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name":"Test account"
}
```

But due to the incorrect plug-in step registration the response will return the following error with all the details when the `Prefer: odata.include-annotations="*"` header is used:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json; odata.metadata=minimal
x-ms-service-request-id: 8fd35fd6-5329-4bd5-a1b7-757f91822322

        "code": "0x80040265",
        "message": "An invalid request URI was provided. The request URI must either be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set.",
        "@Microsoft.PowerApps.CDS.ErrorDetails.OperationStatus": "0",
        "@Microsoft.PowerApps.CDS.ErrorDetails.SubErrorCode": "-2146233088",
        "@Microsoft.PowerApps.CDS.HelpLink": "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398563&error=Microsoft.Crm.CrmException%3a80040265&client=platform",

        "@Microsoft.PowerApps.CDS.InnerError.Message": "An invalid request URI was provided. The request URI must either be an absolute URI or BaseAddress must be set."
    }
}
```

The Plug-in Trace Log will contain this exception data, which includes the `ExceptionDetails` data.

Within Application Insights, if you view traces scoped to this request and with the scope set to `OutboundCall` as shown earlier, you can see that the only entry is that the outbound call started.

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-trace-error.png" alt-text="View traces scoped to this request and with the scope set to OutboundCall.":::

Within Application Insights, when you switch your query to use `exceptions` rather than `traces`, you will see three exceptions logged: 

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-cause-error-exceptions.png" alt-text="Switch your query to use exceptions rather than traces.":::

The one where `cloud_RoleInstance` equals `SandboxRoleInstance` is the one which was written because of the [ILogger LogError method](/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.plugintelemetry.ilogger.logerror). The other two represent different locations where the error was logged on the server. 

> [!NOTE]
> The SandboxRoleInstance `client_Type` is `PC`. This is because the plug-in runs in an isolated sandbox as a client rather than on the server.

You can focus on the error log written by your code by filtering on the `cloud_RoleInstance`:

:::image type="content" source="media/application-insights-ilogger-cause-error-cloud_roleinstance-query.png" alt-text="Focus on the error log written by your code by filtering on the cloud_RoleInstance.":::

The formatted message text is captured as part of the `customDimensions`.
