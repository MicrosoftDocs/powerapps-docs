# Work with data using code in Microsoft Dataverse

There are several different ways to access Dataverse data using code.

- Use the Dataverse [SDK for .NET](#sdk-for-net) or [Web API](#web-api) to retrieve, add, and modify data.
- Use [Dataverse search](#search-dataverse-data) search Dataverse data.
- Use the Dataverse Tabular Data Stream (TDS) endpoint to [query data with SQL](#query-data-with-sql).

This article introduces the options you have to work with Dataverse data using code.

<!-- 
Use Dataverse tables to model and manage business data. You can use [existing tables](reference/about-entity-reference.md) and customize them, or [create your own custom tables](../../maker/data-platform/create-edit-entities-portal.md) to store data.

Dataverse also has APIs known as *messages*. Each message has a name like `Create`, `Delete`, or `WhoAmI`. Messages define a set of input parameters and output properties to encapsulate logic that executes on the server.  If you come from a SQL database background, you can think of these like SQL stored procedures. You can use messages that Dataverse provides or you can [create your own messages](custom-actions.md).

## Retrieve, add, and modify data

Dataverse provides two ways to retrieve, add, and modify data: SDK for .NET & Web API. Choose the one that best matches the requirements, your skills, and preferences.

### SDK for .NET

If you are working with .NET, we recommend using our [SDK for .NET](org-service/overview.md).

- Use the [ServiceClient class](/dotnet/api/microsoft.powerplatform.dataverse.client.serviceclient) in the [DataverseServiceClient NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client/) if you have a client application.
- Use the [Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies/) when you're writing a plug-in or custom workflow activity.

The Dataverse SDK for .NET supports build targets for both .NET Framework and .NET 6+. However, plug-in and custom workflow activities must use .NET Framework.

If you're using our [PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.CrmConnector.PowerShell/) or using our [custom log-in control](xrm-tooling/use-xrm-tooling-common-login-control-client-applications.md) with a Windows client application, use the [the Xrm.Tooling](xrm-tooling/build-windows-client-applications-xrm-tools.md)

- [Use the SDK for .NET](org-service/overview.md)
- [Quickstart: Execute an SDK for .NET request (C#)](org-service/quick-start-org-service-console-app.md)

### Web API

The Dataverse Web API is an OData v4 RESTful endpoint. Use the Web API for any programming language that supports HTTP requests and authentication using OAuth 2.0, including .NET.

- [Learn to use the Dataverse Web API](webapi/overview.md)
- [Quick Start: Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](webapi/quick-start-ps.md)
- [Quick Start: Web API sample (C#)](webapi/quick-start-console-app-csharp.md)


## Search Dataverse data

Dataverse search delivers fast and comprehensive search results across multiple tables, in a single list, sorted by relevance. It also provides capabilities to support suggestions and autocompletion experiences in apps.

Search has a native endpoint and there are Dataverse messages that you can use from the Web API or SDK for .NET.

[Learn to search for Dataverse records](search/overview.md)

## Query data with SQL

The [Power Query Dataverse connector](/power-query/connectors/dataverse) uses the Dataverse Tabular Data Stream (TDS) endpoint to retrieve data using [Dataverse SQL](how-dataverse-sql-differs-from-transact-sql.md), a subset of Transact-SQL.

[Retrieving data using SQL Management Studio (SSMS)](dataverse-sql-query.md#sql-server-management-studio-preview) is a preview feature.

[Learn to use SQL to query data](dataverse-sql-query.md)


## Request and Response payload size limitations

The maximum payload size for any request sent to Dataverse is 128 MB. Requests with payloads over this limit receive a [413 Payload Too Large](https://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413.html) HTTP status code in the response.

There's a 1-GB size limitation on the size of a response that Dataverse returns. Few APIs or queries are capable of returning this much data.  If you encounter this limit, you should consider what other options are available to get the data in multiple, smaller requests.

The deprecated SOAP endpoint payloads use serialized XML data that is much more verbose than the serialized JSON data payloads the Web API uses. You're less likely to encounter errors where the request or response payload is too large when you use the Web API.
