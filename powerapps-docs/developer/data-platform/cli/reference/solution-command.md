This parameter will allow a managed solution that is being imported into an environment convert unmanaged components to managed. If this flag is not explicitly set, the solution system will fail the import request because managed layers cannot go on top of unmanaged base components.  This switch will allow the solution import to succeed and the net result is that the inbound managed solution will be the base layer for each of these components – the components in the destination environment are converted from being an unmanaged component to being a managed component. </li></ul>|`pac solution import --path c:\Users\Documents\Solution.zip `|

## Differences between pac solution clone and export

There are situations where you're unsure when to use `pac solution clone` or `pac solution export` command. You can use one of the commands in the following scenarios:

- Use `pac solution clone` when you need to add new components to the solution.
- Use `pac solution export` when you want to modify the existing content in a solution file but not adding any new components to the solution.

**pac solution clone**

The exported solution looks like a Visual Studio project when you export the solution using the `pac solution clone` command. Instead of a `.csproj` (as in Visual Studio), you'll see a `cdsproj` file. The `cdsproj` file has all the components information that is required to build the project. The build output is a solution zip file which you can import into different environments.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/pac-solution-clone.png" alt-text="Pac solution clone." lightbox="../../media/pac-solution-clone.png":::

The developer does not have to unpack the cloned solution because it is rendered in an unpacked format within the src (source) folder. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/pac-solution-unpack.png" alt-text="Pac solution unpack." lightbox="../../media/pac-solution-unpack.png":::

Now, if you want to associate a newly created plug-in with this solution, with the solution unpacked, you can use the `pac solution add-reference` command to update the `.cdsproj` file to add the new plug-in. Then, you can build the project using either `dotnet build` or `msbuild`. 
   
It is recommended to do a build restore first before building the project. A build restore (dotnet build does a restore first automatically) will restore the required .NET libraries to generate a packed solution.

**pac solution export**

When you export the solution using `pac solution export` you feel like exporting the solution using the maker portal, and the resulting output is a solution zip file.  

:::image type="content" source="../../media/pac-solution-export.png" alt-text="Pac solution export." lightbox="../../media/pac-solution-export.png":::

When you unpack the solution zip file (we do not recommend that you open the zip with standard tools and use the appropriate command from CLI). The resulting directory structure  is similar to the structure in `pac solution clone`. The only difference is that you cannot add references to this unpacked solution, as it doesn't have the `.cdsproj` project file. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/pac-solution-structure.png" alt-text="Pac solution solution structure." lightbox="../../media/pac-solution-structure.png":::

You can modify the relevant set of files that you want to update and then proceed with the solution pack, which generates the solution zip file again to facilitate importing the solution into the target environment. The result from the action is a solution zip file with updated contents and an updated timestamp.
