Represents the name of the related table. If you don't set an alias, one will be generated for you to ensure all columns have unique names, but you will not be able to use that alias to reference the link entity in other parts of the fetch XML. The auto-generated aliases use the pattern `{LogicalName}+{N}`, where `N` is the sequential number of the link-entity in the fetch XML starting from 1.
