# Online Management API for Microsoft Dataverse

> [!NOTE]
> Effective August 26, 2020, the Online Management API is [deprecated](/power-platform/important-changes-coming#online-management-api-powershell-module-and-rest-api-are-deprecated).

Online Management API is a REST API that lets you create and manage Dataverse environments in your Microsoft 365 tenant. Application publishers and ISVs can use the Online Management API to:

-  Automate creation of custom demo Dataverse environments
-  Manage multiple Dataverse environments in case of multi-org setup in their enterprise 

Using the Online Management API, you can perform various tasks on your environment such as create, retrieve, delete, backup and restore environments, and other environment-related tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators can manage Dataverse environments using the admin center or [PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/dynamics365/customer-engagement/overview#get-started-using-the-microsoftxrmonlinemanagementapi-module).
