# Web API Data operations Samples (PowerShell)

This article provides common understanding about Web API samples using PowerShell. Currently, there's only one sample, but we plan to add more. While each sample focuses on a different aspect of Microsoft Dataverse Web API, they all follow similar process and structure described in this article.

## Web API Samples using PowerShell

The following samples use the patterns described here:

| Sample| Sample Group| Description|
|---|---|---|
| [Web API Basic Operations Sample (PowerShell)](samples/basic-operations-powershell.md)| [Web API Basic Operations Sample](web-api-basic-operations-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to create, retrieve, update, delete, associate and disassociate Dataverse table rows (entity records).|
|Not available yet| [Web API Query Data Sample](web-api-query-data-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use OData v4 query syntax and functions and Dataverse query functions. Includes examples of working with predefined queries and using FetchXML to perform queries. |
|Not available yet| [Web API Conditional Operations Sample](web-api-conditional-operations-sample.md) | Demonstrates how to perform conditional operations you specify with ETag criteria.|
|Not available yet|[Web API Functions and Actions Sample](web-api-functions-actions-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use bound and unbound functions and actions, including custom actions.|
|Not available yet|[Web API table schema operations sample](web-api-metadata-operations-sample.md)|Demonstrates how to perform selected operations that modify the Dataverse schema, or metadata.|


## Prerequisites

Before running these samples, you should read these articles that explain concepts and patterns used by these samples:

- [Quick Start Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](quick-start-ps.md)
- [Use PowerShell and Visual Studio Code with the Dataverse Web API](use-ps-and-vscode-web-api.md)

These samples have the same prerequisites.
