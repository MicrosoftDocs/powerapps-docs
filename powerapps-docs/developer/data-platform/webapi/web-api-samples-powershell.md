# Web API Data operations Samples (PowerShell)

This article provides common understanding about Web API samples using PowerShell. While each sample focuses on a different aspect of Microsoft Dataverse Web API, they all follow similar process and structure described in this article.

## Web API Samples using PowerShell

The following samples use the patterns described here:

| Sample| Sample Group| Description|
|---|---|---|
| [Web API Basic Operations Sample (PowerShell)](samples/basic-operations-powershell.md)| [Web API Basic Operations Sample](web-api-basic-operations-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to create, retrieve, update, delete, associate and disassociate Dataverse table rows (entity records).|
|Not available yet| [Web API Query Data Sample](web-api-query-data-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use OData v4 query syntax and functions and Dataverse query functions. Includes examples of working with predefined queries and using FetchXML to perform queries. |
|Not available yet| [Web API Conditional Operations Sample](web-api-conditional-operations-sample.md) | Demonstrates how to perform conditional operations you specify with ETag criteria.|
|Not available yet|[Web API Functions and Actions Sample](web-api-functions-actions-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use bound and unbound functions and actions, including custom actions.|
|[Web API table schema operations sample (PowerShell)](samples/metadata-operations-powershell.md)|[Web API table schema operations sample](web-api-metadata-operations-sample.md)|Demonstrates how to perform selected operations that modify the Dataverse schema, or metadata.|


## Prerequisites

Before running these samples, you should read these articles that explain concepts and patterns used by these samples:

- [Quick Start Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](quick-start-ps.md)
- [Use PowerShell and Visual Studio Code with the Dataverse Web API](use-ps-and-vscode-web-api.md)

These samples have the same prerequisites.
