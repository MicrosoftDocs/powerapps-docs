# Sample: Web API Use bulk operations

These sample applications on GitHub show how to perform bulk create and update operations using the Web API [CreateMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.CreateMultiple), [UpdateMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.UpdateMultiple) and [UpsertMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.UpsertMultiple) actions. The messages for these actions are optimized to provide the most performant way to create or update records with Dataverse.

This sample is a Visual Studio .NET 6.0 solution that contains:

- Two projects that perform the same [CreateMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.CreateMultiple) and [UpdateMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.UpdateMultiple) operations in different ways so that you can compare the performance of each method.
- One project that demonstrates using the [UpsertMultiple](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.UpsertMultiple) action.

See the README.md file in each sample for detailed instructions about how to run the sample and what it does.
