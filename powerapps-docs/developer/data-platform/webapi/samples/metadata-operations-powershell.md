# Web API table schema operations sample (PowerShell)

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../../includes/cc-terminology.md)]

This PowerShell sample demonstrates how to perform operations that create and modify table, column, and relationship definitions using the Dataverse Web API.
  
This sample implements the Dataverse operations and console output detailed in [Web API table schema operations sample](../web-api-metadata-operations-sample.md) and uses the [Dataverse Web API PowerShell Helper functions](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/PS/README.md) to manage authentication and provide reusable functions to perform common operations. These scripts are referenced using [dot sourcing](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_scripts#script-scope-and-dot-sourcing) with the following lines:

```powershell
. $PSScriptRoot\..\Core.ps1
. $PSScriptRoot\..\TableOperations.ps1
. $PSScriptRoot\..\CommonFunctions.ps1
. $PSScriptRoot\..\MetadataOperations.ps1
```

> [!NOTE]
> This sample should work with Windows, Linux, and macOS, but has only been tested on Windows.
  
## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you should read these articles that explain concepts and patterns used by these samples:

- [Quick Start Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](../quick-start-ps.md)
- [Use PowerShell and Visual Studio Code with the Dataverse Web API](../use-ps-and-vscode-web-api.md)

These articles have the same prerequisites.

[!INCLUDE [cc-visual-studio-code-powershell-prerequisites](../../includes/cc-visual-studio-code-powershell-prerequisites.md)]
  
## How to run this sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Open the `/dataverse/webapi/PS/MetadataOperations/MetadataOperationsSample.ps1` file using Visual Studio Code
1. Edit this line to use the URL of the environment you want to connect to:

   `Connect 'https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com/' # change this`

1. (Optional) Set the `$deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `$false` if you don't want to delete the records this sample creates.
1. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run the sample.
1. The first time you run the sample a browser window opens. In the browser window, enter or select the credentials you want to use to authenticate.

To connect as a different user, run the [Disconnect-AzAccount command](/powershell/module/az.accounts/disconnect-azaccount) and try again.

## Code

The code for this sample is at: [PowerApps-Samples/dataverse/webapi/PS/MetadataOperations/MetadataOperationsSample.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/PS/MetadataOperations/MetadataOperationsSample.ps1)

## Demonstrates

This sample has 11 regions:

### Section 0: Create Publisher and Solution

Operations: Create a solution record and an associated publisher record.

> [!NOTE]
> All solution components created in this sample will be associated to the solution so that they can be exported. For operations without a named message, this association is created using the `MSCRM.SolutionUniqueName` request header setting the solution unique name set as the value.
> All names of solution components are prefixed using the publisher customization prefix.

### Section 1: Create, Retrieve and Update Table

Operations:

1. Create a new `sample_BankAccount` user-owned table by sending a `POST` request to `/EntityDefinitions`.
1. Retrieve the created table by sending a `GET` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')`.
1. Update the table by sending a `PUT` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')`.

### Section 2: Create, Retrieve and Update Columns

Operations:

1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_boolean` boolean column by sending a `GET` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')/Attributes(LogicalName='sample_boolean')`.
1. If the column doesn't already exist, create a new `sample_boolean` boolean column for the `sample_BankAccount` table by sending a `POST` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')/Attributes`.
1. Update the `sample_boolean` boolean column by sending a `PUT` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')/Attributes(LogicalName='sample_boolean')`.
1. Update the option labels for the `sample_boolean` boolean column using the [UpdateOptionValue action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.UpdateOptionValue).
1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_datetime` datetime column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_decimal` decimal column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Attempt to retrieve a`sample_integer` integer column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_memo` memo column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_money` money column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Attempt to retrieve a `sample_choice` choice column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Add a new option to the `sample_choice` column using the [InsertOptionValue action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.InsertOptionValue).
1. Change the order of the  options of the `sample_choice` column using the [OrderOption action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.OrderOption).
1. Delete one of the options of the `sample_choice` column using the [DeleteOptionValue action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.DeleteOptionValue).
1. Attempt to retrieve a  `sample_multiselectchoice` multi-select choice column for the `sample_BankAccount` table, and create it if it doesn't exist.
1. Create a new Status option for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [InsertStatusValue Action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.InsertStatusValue). 

### Section 3: Create and use Global OptionSet

Operations:

1. Create a new global choice named `sample_colors` by sending a `POST` request to `/GlobalOptionSetDefinitions`.
1. Retrieve the `sample_colors` global choice by sending a `GET` request to  `/GlobalOptionSetDefinitions(<id value>)`.
1. Create a new `sample_colors` choice column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the `sample_colors` global choice by sending a `POST` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')/Attributes` and associating it to the global choice.

### Section 4: Create Customer Relationship

Operations:

1. Create a new `sample_customerid` customer column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [CreateCustomerRelationships Action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.CreateCustomerRelationships).
1. Retrieve the `sample_customerid` customer column by sending a `GET` request to `/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='sample_bankaccount')/Attributes(LogicalName='sample_customerid')`.

1. Create a 1:N relationship between `sample_BankAccount` and `contact` tables by sending a `POST` request to `/RelationshipDefinitions`.
1. Retrieve the 1:N relationship by sending `GET` request to `/RelationshipDefinitions(<id>)/Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.OneToManyRelationshipMetadata`.

### Section 6: Create and retrieve a many-to-one relationship

### Section 8: Export managed solution

Operations: Export the solution created in [Section 0: Create Publisher and Solution](#section-0-create-publisher-and-solution) containing the items created in this sample using the [ExportSolution Action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.ExportSolution).

### Section 9: Delete sample records

Operations: A reference to each record created in this sample was added to a list as it was created. In this sample the records are deleted in the reverse order in which they were created.

### Section 10: Import and Delete managed solution

Operations:

1. Import the solution exported in [Section 8](#section-8-export-managed-solution) using the [ImportSolution action](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.ImportSolution).
1. Query the solution table to get the `solutionid` of the imported solution.
1. Delete the imported solution using the `solutionid`.

## Clean up

By default this sample will delete all the records created in it. If you want to view created records after the sample is completed, change the `deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `false` and you will be prompted to decide if you want to delete the records.
