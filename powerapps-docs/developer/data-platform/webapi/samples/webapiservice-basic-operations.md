# Web API Basic Operations Sample (C#)

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../../includes/cc-terminology.md)]

This .NET 6.0 sample demonstrates how to perform common data operations using the Dataverse Web API.

This sample uses the common helper code in the [WebAPIService class library (C#)](webapiservice.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> This sample implements the Dataverse operations and console output detailed in [Web API Basic Operations Sample](../web-api-basic-operations-sample.md) and uses the common C# constructs described in [Web API Samples (C#)](../web-api-samples-csharp.md).

## Prerequisites

The following is required to build and run this sample:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
- Access to Dataverse with privileges to perform data operations.

## How to run this sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Locate the [/dataverse/webapi/C#-NETx/BasicOperations/](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/C%23-NETx/BasicOperations) folder.
1. Open the `BasicOperations.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022
1. Edit the `appsettings.json` file to set the following property values:

   |Property|Instructions  |
   |---------|---------|
   |`Url`|The Url for your environment. Replace the placeholder `https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com` value with the value for your environment. See [View developer resources](../../view-download-developer-resources.md) to find this. |
   |`UserPrincipalName`|Replace the placeholder `you@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com` value with the UPN value you use to access the environment.|
   |`Password`|Replace the placeholder `yourPassword` value with the password you use.|

1. Save the `appsettings.json` file
1. Press F5 to run the sample.

## Code

The code for this sample is here: [PowerApps-Samples/dataverse/webapi/C#-NETx/BasicOperations/Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/C%23-NETx/BasicOperations/Program.cs)

## Demonstrates

This sample has 5 regions:

### Section 1: Basic Create and Update operations

Operations:

- Create a contact record.
- Update the contact record.
- Retrieve the contact record.
- Update a single property of the contact record.
- Retrieve a single property of the contact record.

### Section 2: Create record associated to another

Operations: Associate a new record to an existing one.

### Section 3: Create related entities

Operations: Create the following entries in one operation: an account, its associated primary contact, and open tasks for that contact.  These entity types have the following relationships:

```
Accounts
    |---[Primary] Contact (N-to-1)
        |---Tasks (1-to-N)
```

### Section 4: Associate and Disassociate entities

Operations:

- Add a contact to the account `contact_customer_accounts` collection.
- Remove a contact from the account `contact_customer_accounts` collection.
- Associate a security role to a user using the `systemuserroles_association` collection.
- Remove a security role for a user using the `systemuserroles_association` collection.

### Section 5: Delete sample entities

Operations: A reference to each record created in this sample was added to a list as it was created. This section loops through that list and deletes each record.

## Clean up

By default this sample will delete all the records created in it. If you want to view created records after the sample is completed, change the `deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `false` and you will be prompted to decide if you want to delete the records.
