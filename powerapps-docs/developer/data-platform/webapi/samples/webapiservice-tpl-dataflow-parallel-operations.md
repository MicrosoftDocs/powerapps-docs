# Web API Parallel Operations with TPL Dataflow components Sample (C#)

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../../includes/cc-terminology.md)]


This .NET 6.0 sample demonstrates how to perform parallel data operations using the Dataverse Web API with Task Parallel Library (TPL) Dataflow components. More information: [Dataflow (Task Parallel Library)](/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library).

This sample uses the common helper code in the [WebAPIService class library (C#)](webapiservice.md).

## Prerequisites

The following is required to build and run this sample:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
- Access to Dataverse with privileges to perform data operations.

## How to run this sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Locate the [/dataverse/webapi/C#-NETx/TPLDataFlowParallelOperations/](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/C%23-NETx/TPLDataFlowParallelOperations) folder.
1. Open the `TPLDataFlowParallelOperations.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022
1. Edit the `appsettings.json` file to set the following property values:

   |Property|Instructions  |
   |---------|---------|
   |`Url`|The Url for your environment. Replace the placeholder `https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com` value with the value for your environment. See [View developer resources](../../view-download-developer-resources.md) to find this. |
   |`UserPrincipalName`|Replace the placeholder `you@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com` value with the UPN value you use to access the environment.|
   |`Password`|Replace the placeholder `yourPassword` value with the password you use.|

1. Save the `appsettings.json` file
1. Press F5 to run the sample.

## Code

The code for this sample is here: [PowerApps-Samples/dataverse/webapi/C#-NETx/TPLDataFlowParallelOperations/Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/C%23-NETx/TPLDataFlowParallelOperations/Program.cs)

## Demonstrates

This sample includes settings you can apply to optimize your connection.

This sample first sends a request simply to access the value of the `x-ms-dop-hint` response header to determine the recommended degrees of parallelism for this environment. When the maximum degree of parallelism is set equal to the value of the `x-ms-dop-hint` response header you should achieve a steady state where throughput is optimized with a minimum of `429 TooManyRequests` service protection limit errors returned.

To encounter service protection limits with this sample you should raise the `numberOfRecords` variable to over 10,000 or whatever is needed for the sample to run for more than 5 minutes. You should also change the code to set the `maxDegreeOfParallelism` to be significantly greater than `x-ms-dop-hint` response header value. Then, using Fiddler you should be able to observe how WebAPIService retries the requests that return this error.

This sample simply creates a configurable number of account records, which it will in turn delete. This sample uses dataflow components to process the records and transform the results of the create operation into the next phase that deletes these records. Because of the nature of this data flow, delete operations for previously created records will start before all the records to create are finished.

You may want to compare this sample to the [Web API CDSWebApiService Parallel Operations Sample (C#)](webapiservice-parallel-operations.md).

## Clean up

By default this sample will delete all the records created in it. If you want to view created records after the sample is completed, change the `deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `false` and you will be prompted to decide if you want to delete the records.
