# Access entity data faster using storage partitions

An optional partition key can be specified to create a logical partition for non-relational custom entity data stored in NoSql tables of Azure heterogenous storage ([Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)). Having a partition key improves application performance for large sets of data (millions of records) by grouping data items into logical sets within a table. For example, a table containing products can be grouped logically into product categories to improve retrieval of all items within a product category. The partition key value can be a string or numeric type. Once specified, the partition key value can't be changed.

When no partition key is specified, the table is the logical boundary and retrieving a single item or a set of logically related items from a large data set will not be as performant as when using a partition key.

## Creating and accessing a partition

A unique new partition key value must be used to create a new logical partition. The same value must be used to create additional items in the same logical partition and to retrieve, update, or delete items belonging to the logical partition.

An HTTP command that creates a new customer entity record in a new storage partition named "CustomerPartition".

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/new_msdyn_customers?partitionid="CustomerPartition"
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "new_firstname": "Monica",
  "new_lastname": "Thompson",
}
```

HTTP commands that retrieve one and all customer records from the named storage partition.

```http
GET [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/new_msdyn_customers(<cID>)?partitionId="CustomerPartition"
GET [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/new_msdyn_customers?partitionId="CustomerPartition"
```

An HTTP command that updates a customer record in the named storage partition.

```http
PATCH [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/new_msdyn_customers(<cID>)?partitionid="CustomerPartition"
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "new_firstname": "Cora",
  "new_lastname": "Thomas",
}
```

An HTTP command that deletes a customer record in the named storage partition.

```http
DELETE [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.1/new_msdyn_customers(<cID>)?partitionId="CustomerPartition"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For a GET or DELETE command, the partition identifier parameter is case sensitive and must be specified with e capital "I" as in "partition**I**d".

## Additional information

Here are a few more details about the partition key and partition management.

- The key value must be unique in the environment.
- A partition is limited to 20 GB of data, and there is no method available to check the partition's current size.
- There is no defined limit to the number of partitions you can allocate in an environment.
- Partition allocation is automatic. Specifying a unique partition key during a Create operation creates a partition. When all data has been deleted from the partition, the partition is deleted.
- There is no method available to rename a key.
- Presently, only the Create, Update, Retrieve, and Delete entity operations support storage partitioning.
