# Use Insomnia with Dataverse Web API

There are many client API tools you can use to authenticate to Microsoft Dataverse environments to compose and send Web API requests. These tools make it easier to learn, test, and perform ad-hoc queries using the Dataverse Web API.

This article has two goals:

1. Demonstrate a strategy to authenticate and connect to Dataverse using [Insomnia API client](https://insomnia.rest/) with a Microsoft Entra application (client) ID provided by Microsoft that is preapproved for all Dataverse environments. This means you don't need to register an application to get started using the Dataverse Web API.
1. Introduce you to some basic data operations you can perform using the Dataverse Web API in the context of the Insomnia API client. This way, you can use Insomnia to continue to experiment and learn about the Dataverse Web API.

## Privacy

Requests you send with client API tools contain information that could be sensitive. Many developers don't want to have this information uploaded to a cloud service.

The [Insomnia local Scratch Pad](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/scratchpad) doesn't require that you create an account and doesn't store information about requests you send. The instructions provided here describe how to use Insomnia local Scratch Pad only. You can choose to create an account and use all the Insomnia features if you wish. If you want a version that has no options to create an account and is focused on privacy, see [Insomnium](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use PowerShell with Visual Studio Code to authenticate with Dataverse Web API as an alternative to Insomnia or other API clients. [Get started using Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](quick-start-ps.md). This method:
>
> - Uses the Azure AD app registration so you don't need to provide an application (client) ID.
> - Doesn't send any information about your requests anywhere.
>
> The instructions in this article represent the experience provided by Insomnia when this article was written. The user experience will probably change over time and this article might not represent the current experience. This article will be updated only when changes occur that fundamentally break the steps described here. [Learn more in the Insomnia documentation](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/get-started)

## Install Insomnia

See the [Insomnia documentation for steps to install Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install). The instructions are different for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

For Windows, the installer is an executable (exe) that you download and run. When the installation completes, you might be offered different options. These options shouldn't interfere with the instructions in this article, but they might change. At the time this article was written, these options were presented:

- For the option to enable features to sync data with the cloud, choose **Keep storing locally in Local Vault**.
- For the option to create an account, choose **Use the local Scratch Pad**. [Learn more about Insomnia Scratch Pad](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/scratchpad)

   :::image type="content" source="media/welcome-to-insomnia.png" alt-text="The welcome to insomnia dialog including the Use the local Scratch Pad option.":::

## Configure the base environment

Use Insomnia environments to store [environment variables](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/environment-variables). Environment variables are a JSON object containing key-value pairs of data that you can reference for many purposes.

The *[base environment](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/environment-variables#base-environment)* is assigned to every workspace and the variables within it can be accessed throughout the workspace.

1. After you open Insomnia, select the gear icon :::image type="icon" source="media/insomnia-gear-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the base environment to open the **Manage Environments** dialog. Or use the <kbd>Ctrl + E</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
1. Copy the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
      "url": "https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com",
      "version": "9.2",
      "webapiurl": "{{ _.url }}/api/data/v{{ _.version }}/",
      "redirecturl": "https://localhost",
      "authurl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?resource={{ _.url }}",
      "clientid": "51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d"
   }
   ```

1. Paste the JSON into the base environment.
1. Edit the `url` property value and replace the `https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com` value  match the URL for your Dataverse environment.

   You can find the Web API endpoint for your environment using the instructions in [View developer resources](../view-download-developer-resources.md). Remove `/api/data/v9.2` from the Web API endpoint URL. This URL must end in `dynamics.com`.

   You should expect that the references to the `_.url` and `_.version` variables might not resolve immediately, so you see warnings like this:

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-unresolved-environment-variables.png" alt-text="Unresolved environment variables":::

   However, after you close the window and reopen it, you can see that the variables are now known and resolved.

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-resolved-environment-variables.png" alt-text="Resolved environment variables":::


## Create sub environments (optional)

If you only ever need to connect to a single Dataverse environment, you can just use the base environment. If you need to connect to multiple environments, you can create *[sub environments](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/environment-variables#sub-environments)* for each Dataverse environment. For example, you can create a sub environment for your development and test Dataverse environments.

1. As you did with the base environment, select the gear icon :::image type="icon" source="media/insomnia-gear-icon.png" border="false"::: next to the base environment to open the **Manage Environments** dialog. Or use the <kbd>Ctrl + E</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/insomnia-plus-icon.png" border="false"::: icon to create a new environment. Environments can be *shared* or *private*. Choose **Private environment**.
1. Double click the name of the **New Environment** you created and rename it as you like, you can give it the name of the Dataverse environment you want to connect to, or something like **Dev environment.**
1. Copy the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
      "url": "https://yourdevorg.api.crm.dynamics.com"
   }
   ```

1. Paste the JSON into the environment you created.
1. Edit the `url` property value to represent the Web API endpoint for your other environment, just as you did for the base environment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You only need to include the `url` property in the sub environment. When the sub environment is selected, this value will override the `url` value specified in the base environment. You can also include any of the 5 other properties if you wish, but the `url` property value is the only one that is different for each Dataverse environment.

## Configure requests

After you configured your base environment and any sub-environments, you're ready to configure a request.

1. Select the **New HTTP Request** button, or use the <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> keyboard shortcut.
1. After the HTTP method, which is `GET` by default, type `_.` and wait a moment. Insomnia shows a list of available variables to choose from:

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-variables-url.png" alt-text="Environment variables for url.":::

1. Choose the `_.webapiurl` variable. The **URL PREVIEW** field should show the value using the `url` property value for your selected environment.
1. In the **Auth** tab, use the drop-down to select **OAuth 2.0** **AUTH TYPE**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-choose-oauth-2.0-auth-type.png" alt-text="Select the OAuth 2.0 auth type":::

1. Edit the authentication configuration as shown in the following table, using the environment variables you created:

   |Field  |Value|
   |---------|---------|
   |**GRANT TYPE**|Implicit|
   |**AUTHORIZATION URL**|`_.authurl`|
   |**CLIENT ID**|`_.clientid`|
   |**REDIRECT URL**|`_.redirecturl`|

1. Select **Send**.

   A dialog should open to enter the credentials for the environment.

   After you enter your credentials, you should see results in the **Preview** pane that look something like this:

   ```json
   {
   "@odata.context": "https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/$metadata",
   "value": [
      {
         "name": "aadusers",
         "kind": "EntitySet",
         "url": "aadusers"
      },
      {
         "name": "accounts",
         "kind": "EntitySet",
         "url": "accounts"
      },
      {
         "name": "aciviewmappers",
         "kind": "EntitySet",
         "url": "aciviewmappers"
      },
      {
         "name": "actioncards",
         "kind": "EntitySet",
         "url": "actioncards"
      },
      ...
   ```

   This result is the [Web API service document](web-api-service-documents.md#service-document). You view the service document by sending a **GET** request to the root of the Web API service url. It lists the [entity set names](web-api-service-documents.md#entity-set-name) for all the tables in your Dataverse environment. When you can see the service document, you have successfully authenticated to your Dataverse environment.

   > [!TIP]
   > This is a convenient way to find or verify the entity set name for a table you are working with.

## View the CSDL $metadata document

The Common Schema Definition Language (CSDL) $metadata document is the source of truth for everything related to Web API. You will want to reference it frequently.

1. Edit the URL by appending `$metadata?annotations=true` after the `_.webapiurl` variable. The URL should be:
   
   `GET _.webapiurl $metadata?annotations=true`

1. Select **Send**.

In the **Preview** pane, you should see a message saying Response over 5MB hidden for performance reasons, with the options to **Save To File** and **Show Anyway**. The file is large, but you should be able to preview it without problems.

### Find definitions of types

CSDL $metadata document is large. The Insomnia preview provides a response filtering tool at the bottom. You can use [XPath queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/XPath) to filter the response to find what you need. The following table shows some examples:


|Find|XPath query|
|---------|---------|
|All entity types|`//*[local-name() = 'EntityType']`|
|The [account EntityType](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/account)|`//*[local-name() = 'EntityType'][@Name = 'account']`|
|All functions|`//*[local-name() = 'Function']`|
|The [WhoAmI function](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/whoami)|`//*[local-name() = 'Function'][@Name = 'WhoAmI']`|
|All actions|`//*[local-name() = 'Action']`|
|The [CreateMultiple action](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/createmultiple)|`//*[local-name() = 'Action'][@Name = 'CreateMultiple']`|
|All complex types|`//*[local-name() = 'ComplexType']`|
|The [WhoAmIResponse complex type](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/whoamiresponse)|`//*[local-name() = 'ComplexType'][@Name = 'WhoAmIResponse']`|
|All enum types|`//*[local-name() = 'EnumType']`|
|The [AccessRights enum type](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/accessrights)|`//*[local-name() = 'EnumType'][@Name = 'AccessRights']`|

[Learn more about the types defined in the CSDL $metadata document](web-api-types-operations.md)


## Send a WhoAmI request

Now that you're authenticated, modify your request to invoke the [WhoAmI function](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/whoami). Because `WhoAmI` is a function, you use a `GET` method. This function has no parameters, so it's easy to use. [Learn more about using Web API Functions](use-web-api-functions.md)

1. Edit the URL by appending `WhoAmI` after the `_.webapiurl` variable. The URL should be:
   
   `GET _.webapiurl WhoAmI`

1. Set request headers.

   As described in [HTTP headers](compose-http-requests-handle-errors.md#http-headers), each Web API request should have a specific set of request headers and you might need to modify header values for different behaviors.

   In the **Headers** tab, select the **Add** button to enter each of the following common headers:

   |Header  |Value|
   |---------|---------|
   |`Accept`|`application/json`|
   |`OData-MaxVersion`|`4.0`|
   |`OData-Version`|`4.0`|
   |`If-None-Match`|`null`|
   |`Prefer`|`odata.include-annotations="*"`|

   These headers don't change the behavior of the [WhoAmI function](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/whoami), but it's good to start adding them at the beginning.

1. Select **Send**.

   In the **Preview** pane, you should see data corresponding to the [WhoAmIResponse complex type](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/whoamiresponse).
   
   ```json
   {
      "@odata.context": "https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.WhoAmIResponse",
      "BusinessUnitId": "77164db8-dbc7-ee11-907a-00224803d046",
      "UserId": "e6b56e50-a3d5-ee11-9078-000d3a59a579",
      "OrganizationId": "100462a3-76cb-ee11-9075-00224806e300"
   }
   ```

## Retrieve data

To use Insomnia to retrieve records, you must set the [entity set name](web-api-service-documents.md#entity-set-name) for the resource.

1. Change the URL to remove `WhoAmI` after the `_.webapiurl` variable, and replace it with `accounts`, the entity set name for the [account entity type](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/account). The URL should be:
   
   `GET _.webapiurl accounts`

1. In the **Parameters** tab, set the parameters for your query.

   You can add parameters individually by selecting the **Add** button. But you can also select the **Bulk Edit** option, which you might find easier.
   
   1. Select the **Bulk Edit** option.
   1. Copy the following parameters:
   
   ```text
   $top: 3
   $select: name,revenue,address1_city
   $expand: primarycontactid($select=fullname)
   $filter: address1_city eq 'Redmond'
   ```

   This query returns selected columns from the top three account records located in the city of Redmond, and includes information about any related contact specified as the primary contact for the accounts.

   1. Paste the values in the **QUERY PARAMETERS** field.

      Your query should look like this:

      :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-account-query.png" alt-text="A query that retrieves account records":::

1. Select **Send**.

   In the **Preview** pane, you should see results like the following:

   ```json
   {
   "@odata.context": "https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#accounts(name,revenue,address1_city,primarycontactid(fullname))",

         }
      }
   ]
   }
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > These results include many *annotation values* such as `@OData.Community.Display.V1.FormattedValue` because the `Prefer: odata.include-annotations="*"` request header set in [Send a WhoAmI request](#send-a-whoami-request) is set to return all annotations. [Learn how to request specific annotations](compose-http-requests-handle-errors.md#request-annotations)

[Learn more about how to query data](query-data-web-api.md)

## Create a record

With Insomnia, you can define multiple requests that you can reuse. The easy way to create a new request that keeps any configurations you have is to duplicate an existing request. In this step, we duplicate the request defined in the [Retrieve data](#retrieve-data) section and create a new request to create a record.

1. The request you created in [Retrieve data](#retrieve-data) has the default name **New Request**, unless you changed it. Rename the request **Retrieve Accounts**.
1. When you hover over the **Retrieve Accounts** request, select the drop-down menu and select **Duplicate**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-duplicate-request.png" alt-text="Duplicating a request in Insomnia":::

1. In the **Duplicate Request** dialog, set the **New Name** to **Create Account**.
1. In the new **Create Account** request, change the HTTP method from `GET` to `POST`. The url is already set to use the `accounts` entity set name, so you don't need to change anything else here. The URL should be:
   
   `POST _.webapiurl accounts`

1. In the **Parameters** tab, you can delete all the parameters because they aren't used for the create operation.
1. In the **Body** tab, use the drop-down to select **JSON** from the **TEXT** group:

   :::image type="content" source="media/insomnia-select-body-json.png" alt-text="Selecting the JSON body type":::

1. Copy the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
      "name": "An Example Account record (sample)",
      "revenue": 10000.0,
      "address1_city": "Redmond"
   }
   ```

1. Paste the JSON in the **Body** field.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Before you press **Send** to create the record, look at the data in the **Auth** and **Headers** tabs. Because you created this request by duplicating the **Retrieve Accounts** request, all the information you previously configured is re-used.

1. Press **Send** to create the record.

   You should see that the service returned **204 No Content**, so there's no content to see in the **Preview** pane.

   The URL to the created record is visible in the **Headers** list. Look for the `odata-entityid` response header. The value should look something like this:

   ```text
   https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/accounts(5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4)
   ```

   This URL contains the primary key field value for the created record, in this case the `accountid` property value.

[Learn more about creating records](create-entity-web-api.md)

## Retrieve a record

Now that you created an account record and know the primary key field value, you can retrieve it using that value. Start by duplicating the **Retrieve Accounts** request.

1. Duplicate the **Retrieve Accounts** request.
1. Name it **Retrieve account**.
1. Edit the URL to append the `accountid` value in parentheses after the entity set name. If the `accountid` of the account you created in [Create a record](#create-a-record) was `5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4`, edit the url to be:
   
   `GET _.webapiurl accounts(5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4)`

1. In the **Parameters** tab, remove the `$top`, `$expand`, and `$filter` parameters, leaving only the `$select` parameter to limit the number of columns returned.
1. In the **Headers** tab, select the checkbox next to the `Prefer` header to disable it so that no annotations are returned.
1. Select **Send**.

   The response should return **200 OK**, and the **Preview** pane should contain data like the following:

   ```json
   {
      "@odata.context": "https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/$metadata#accounts(name,revenue,address1_city)/$entity",
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"2343128\"",
      "name": "An Example Account record (sample)",
      "revenue": 10000.0000000000,
      "address1_city": "Redmond",
      "accountid": "5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4",
      "_transactioncurrencyid_value": "57f82f38-09c8-ee11-907a-00224803d046",
      "address1_composite": "Redmond"
   }
   ```

[Learn more about retrieving records](retrieve-entity-using-web-api.md)

## Delete a record

Now that you have created and retrieved a record using the primary key value, you can now delete it.

1. Duplicate the **Retrieve account** request. Name the new request **Delete account**.
1. Change the HTTP method from `GET` to `DELETE`.
   
   The URL should still contain the data with the `accountid` of the record you created and retrieved before:

   `DELETE _.webapiurl accounts(5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4)`

1. In the **Parameters** tab, remove the `$select` parameter because it's meaningless for a delete operation.
1. Select **Send**.

   You should see that the service returned **204 No Content**, so there's no content to see in the **Preview** pane.

1. Try sending the **Retrieve account** request now, it returns **404 Not Found** and the **Preview** pane shows this error:

   ```json
   {
      "error": {
         "code": "0x80040217",
         "message": "Entity 'account' With Id = 5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4 Does Not Exist"
      }
   }
   ```

1. Re-enable the `Prefer` header for the **Retrieve account** request so that all annotations are returned.
1. Send the request again, and you can now see many annotations are returned with the **404 Not Found** response:

   ```json
   {
      "error": {
         "code": "0x80040217",
         "message": "Entity 'account' With Id = 5b4ced1c-88e1-ee11-904c-6045bd05e9d4 Does Not Exist",
