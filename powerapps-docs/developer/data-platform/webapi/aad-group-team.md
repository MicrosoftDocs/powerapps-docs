# Work with Azure Active Directory group teams

An Azure Active Directory (AAD) group team, similar to an owner team, can own records and can have security roles assigned to the team. To read more about AAD group teams see [Manage group teams](/power-platform/admin/manage-group-teams).

The following sections describe how to work with AAD group teams using the Web API.

## Create an AAD group team

Citizen developers wanting to programmatically create a Microsoft Dataverse AAD group team can do so by providing the object ID of an existing AAD group as shown in the following command.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/teams
Accept: application/json

{
  "azureactivedirectoryobjectid":"<group object ID>",
  "membershiptype":0
}
```

Where:

- Membership type is defined in the [team property](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/team#properties) `membershiptype`
- Name of the team is the name of the AAD group
- Team type is based on the AAD group type - for example "Security" or "Microsoft 365"

## Assign a security role to an AAD group team

An administrator can assign a security role to an AAD group team after the AAD group team is created.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/teams(azureactivedirectoryobjectid=<group team ID>,membershiptype=0)/teamroles_association/$ref
Accept: application/json

{ 
  "@odata.id":"[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/roles(<role ID>)"
}
```

## Assign a security role to a user

An administrator can assign a security role to an AAD group user.  The user is added into Dataverse automatically if the user doesn’t exist in Dataverse and the role is assigned directly to the user.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/systemusers(azureactivedirectoryobjectid=<user object ID>)/systemuserroles_association/$ref
Accept: application/json

{ 
  "@odata.id":"[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/roles(<role ID>)"
}
```

## Assign a record to an AAD group member

An administrator can assign a record to an AAD group member.  The AAD group member is added into Dataverse automatically if the user doesn’t exist in Dataverse.

The example below shows the syntax for assigning an account record.

**Request**

```http
PATCH [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/accounts(<account ID>)
Accept: application/json

{ 
  "ownerid@odata.bind": "[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/systemusers(azureactivedirectoryobjectid=<user object ID>)"
}
```

## Share a record to an AAD group member

“An administrator or a record owner can share a record to an AAD group member. The AAD group member is added into Dataverse automatically if the user doesn’t exist in Dataverse.

The example below shows the syntax for sharing an account record.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/GrantAccess
Accept: application/json

{
  "Target":{
    "accountid":"<account ID>",
    "@odata.type":"Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.account"
  },
  "PrincipalAccess":{
    "Principal":{
      "@odata.id":"[Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/systemusers(azureactivedirectoryobjectid=<user object ID>)"
    },
    "AccessMask":"ReadAccess"
  }
}
```

## Security roles and privileges

Members of an AAD group can query all the security roles that are directly and indirectly assigned to them using the following command.

**Request**

```http
GET [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/RetrieveAadUserRoles(DirectoryObjectId=<user object ID)?$select=_parentrootroleid_value,name
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "https://contoso.crm2.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/$metadata#roles",
  "value": [
    {
      "@odata.etag": "W/\"1649865\"",
      "name": "System Administrator",
      "roleid": "ae0daa93-e566-eb11-bb2b-000d3ac4c3f6",
      "_parentrootroleid_value": "ae0daa93-e566-eb11-bb2b-000d3ac4c3f6",
      "t_x002e_azureactivedirectoryobjectid": "e1341054-98ed-489b-a522-15e9e277b737",
      "t_x002e_membershiptype": 0,
      "t_x002e_teamid": "26e477f8-3f6a-eb11-bb2b-000d3af6caae",
      "t_x002e_name": "testgroup"
    }
  ]
}
```

Members of an AAD group can check their security privileges without being a user of Dataverse using the following command.

**Request**

```http
GET [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/RetrieveAadUserPrivileges(DirectoryObjectId=<user object ID>)
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "https://contoso.crm2.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.0/$metadata#Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.RetrieveAadUserPrivilegesResponse",
  "RolePrivileges": [
    {
      "Depth": "Global",
      "PrivilegeId": "0a620778-3e9f-46ec-9766-000624db57ba",
      "BusinessUnitId": "aa0daa93-e566-eb11-bb2b-000d3ac4c3f6",
      "PrivilegeName": "prvDeleteHierarchyRule"
    },
    …
   ]
}
```
