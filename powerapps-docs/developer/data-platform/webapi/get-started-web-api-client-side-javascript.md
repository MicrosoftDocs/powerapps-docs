# Client-side JavaScript using Web API in model-driven apps

In HTML web resources, form scripts, or ribbon commands in model-driven apps, you can use JavaScript to perform operations on Microsoft Dataverse data using the Web API. Use the [Xrm.WebApi](../../model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference/xrm-webapi.md) client API methods to use Web API with JavaScript and web resources.
