# DataverseWebAPI.js sample library

The [`DataverseWebAPI.js` sample library](#dataversewebapijs-sample-library-code) contains the implementation of the [`Client`](#client-class) and [`ChangeSet`](#changeset-class) classes for interacting with the Dataverse Web API in the [Web API Data operations Samples (Client-side JavaScript)](web-api-samples-client-side-javascript.md). This sample library demonstrates a set of methods to perform CRUD operations, batch requests, and other interactions with the Dataverse Web API.

This library demonstrates:

- Using configuration data passed to the library
- Managing errors returned by the Dataverse Web API
- Helping keep code [DRY](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and encourage reuse.
- A pattern of code reuse by:

   - All operations pass through a common [Send method](#sendrequest) that accepts a single [Request class](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) instance and adds common headers including `Authorization`.
   - Providing a [Batch method](#batchrequests-continueonerror--false) that accepts [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) classes and returns [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) classes.
   - Each method provided represents a sample showing how to construct a `Request` instance that can be used with the `Batch` method.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample library is a helper that is used by all the Dataverse JavaScript client-side Web API samples, but it is not an SDK. It is tested only to confirm that the samples that use it run successfully. This sample code is provided 'as-is' with no warranty for reuse.

This library doesn't:

- **Manage authentication**. It depends on a function passed from an application that provides the access token to use.
- **Provide for any code generation capabilities**. All methods used in the samples are written by hand. All business entity data uses JavaScript objects rather than a class representing the entity type.
- **Provide an object model for composing OData queries**. All queries show the OData query syntax as query parameters.

This library contains definitions of the following classes:

|Class|Description|
|---|---|
|[`Client`](#client-class)|The `Client` class represents the Dataverse Web API Client. It provides methods to interact with the Dataverse Web API.|
|[`ChangeSet`](#changeset-class)|Represents a set of changes used with batch processing. All requests within the changeset must succeed or fail as a group.|

You can find the code for this library below in [DataverseWebAPI.js sample library code](#dataversewebapijs-sample-library-code) and also on GitHub at PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/JS/SPASample/src/scripts/DataverseWebAPI.js](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/JS/SPASample/src/scripts/DataverseWebAPI.js).
