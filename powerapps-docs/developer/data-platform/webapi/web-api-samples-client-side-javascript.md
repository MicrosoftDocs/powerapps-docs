# Web API Data operations Samples (Client-side JavaScript)

This article provides common understanding about Web API samples using client-side JavaScript. While each sample focuses on a different aspect of Microsoft Dataverse Web API, they all follow similar process and structure described in this topic.

## Web API Samples using client-side JavaScript

The following samples use the patterns described here:

|Sample| Sample Group|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Web API Basic Operations Sample (Client-side JavaScript)](samples/basic-operations-client-side-javascript.md)| [Web API Basic Operations Sample](web-api-basic-operations-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to create, retrieve, update, delete, associate and disassociate Dataverse table rows (entity records).|
| [Web API Query Data Sample (Client-side JavaScript)](samples/query-data-client-side-javascript.md)| [Web API Query Data Sample](web-api-query-data-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use OData v4 query syntax and functions as well as Dataverse query functions. Includes demonstration of working with pre-defined queries and using FetchXML to perform queries. |
| [Web API Conditional Operations Sample (Client-side JavaScript)](samples/conditional-operations-client-side-javascript.md) | [Web API Conditional Operations Sample](web-api-conditional-operations-sample.md) | Demonstrates how to perform conditional operations. The behavior of these operations depends on criteria you specify.|
| [Web API Functions and Actions Sample (Client-side JavaScript)](samples/functions-actions-client-side-javascript.md)| [Web API Functions and Actions Sample](web-api-functions-actions-sample.md)| Demonstrates how to use bound and unbound functions and actions, including custom actions.|

## Common elements found in each sample

All the samples in this group have the following in common.

- They are all included in the same sample SPA application
- Each sample implements a common interface with `Setup`, `Run`, and `Cleanup` methods.
- All the samples use a common [DataverseWebAPI.js sample library](dataversewebapi-sample-library.md) that provides re-usable methods to perform operations with business data in Dataverse.
