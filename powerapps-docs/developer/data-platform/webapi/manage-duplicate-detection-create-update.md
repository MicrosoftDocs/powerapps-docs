# Detect duplicate data using the Web API

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../includes/cc-terminology.md)]

You can detect duplicate table rows of an existing row in order to maintain integrity of data. For detailed information about detecting duplicate data using code, see [Detect duplicate data using code](../detect-duplicate-data-with-code.md) 

## Detect duplicates during Create operation

Use the `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` request header with a `POST` request to detect creation of a duplicate record of an existing record. The value assigned to `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` header determines whether the Create or Update operation can be completed:

- `true` – Create or update the record, if a duplicate is found.
- `false` – Do not create or update the record, if a duplicate is found.

Use preference header `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` and set its value to `false` in the Web API request.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure there are appropriate duplicate detection rules in place. Dataverse includes default duplicate detection rules for accounts, contacts, and leads, but not for other types of records. If you want the system to detect duplicates for other record types, you'll need to create a new rule. <br/>- For information on how to create a duplicate detection rule using the UI, see [Set up duplicate detection rules to keep your data clean](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/set-up-duplicate-detection-rules-keep-data-clean).<br/>- For information on creating duplicate detection rules using code, see [Duplicate rule tables](../duplicaterule-entities.md)

### Example: Detect duplicates during Create operation using the Web API

The following example shows how to detect duplicates during `Create` and `Update` operations using `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` header in Web API request.

**Request**

```http
POST [Organization URI]/org1/api/data/v9.0/leads HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: null
OData-Version: 4.0
OData-MaxVersion: 4.0
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection: false


{
    "firstname":"Monte",
    "lastname":"Orton",
    "emailaddress1":"monteorton@example.com"
}
```
If a lead record with the same `emailaddress1` attribute already exists, the following Response is returned.

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error  
Content-Type: application/json; odata.metadata=minimal  
OData-Version: 4.0

{
    "error": {
        "code": "0x80040333",
        "message": "A record was not created or updated because a duplicate of the current record already exists."
    }
}
```

Assign value `true` to `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` header to allow creation of a duplicate record.

<a name="bkmk_update"></a>

## Detect duplicates during Update operation

Set the value of `MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection` header to `false` in your `PATCH` request to avoid creation of a duplicate record during Update operation. By default, duplicate detection is suppressed when you are updating records using the Web API.

### Example: Detect duplicates during Update operation using the Web API

The example shown below attempts to update an existing lead entity record which includes the same value of `emailaddress1` attribute as an existing record.

**Request**

```http
PATCH [Organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/leads(c4567bb6-47a3-e711-811b-e0071b6ac1b1) HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: null
OData-Version: 4.0
OData-MaxVersion: 4.0
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
MSCRM.SuppressDuplicateDetection: false
If-Match: * 

{
    "firstname":"Monte",
    "lastname":"Orton",
    "emailaddress1":"monteorton@example.com"
}
```  

**Response**

```http  
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error  
Content-Type: application/json; odata.metadata=minimal  
OData-Version: 4.0

{
    "error": {
        "code": "0x80040333",
        "message": "A record was not created or updated because a duplicate of the current record already exists."
    }
}
```
