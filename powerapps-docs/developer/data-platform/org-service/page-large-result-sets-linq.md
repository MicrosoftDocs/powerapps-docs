# Page large result sets with LINQ

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

In Microsoft Dataverse, you can page the results of a large .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) query by using the `Take` and `Skip` operators. The `Take` operator retrieves a specified number of results and the `Skip` operator skips over a specified number of results.  
  
## LINQ paging example  

The following example shows how to page the results of a LINQ query by using the `Take` and `Skip` operators:  
  
```csharp
int pageSize = 5;

var accountsByPage = (from a in svcContext.AccountSet
                      select new Account
                      {
                       Name = a.Name,
                      });
System.Console.WriteLine("Skip 10 accounts, then Take 5 accounts");
System.Console.WriteLine("======================================");
foreach (var a in accountsByPage.Skip(2 * pageSize).Take(pageSize))
{
 System.Console.WriteLine(a.Name);
}

```
