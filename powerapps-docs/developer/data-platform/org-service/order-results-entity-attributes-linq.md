# Order results using entity attributes with LINQ

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

In Microsoft Dataverse(Dataverse) for Apps, you can use lookup or OptionSet (Picklist) attributes to order results within a LINQ query. This topic shows several examples of this type of query.  
  
## Using a Lookup Value to Order By  

The following sample shows use the lookup attribute `PrimaryContactId` in an `Order By` clause.  
  
```csharp
using (ServiceContext svcContext = new ServiceContext(_serviceProxy))
{
 var query_orderbylookup = from a in svcContext.AccountSet
                           where a.Address1_Name == "Contoso Pharmaceuticals"
                           orderby a.PrimaryContactId
                           select new
                           {
                            a.Name,
                            a.Address1_City
                           };
 foreach (var a in query_orderbylookup)
 {
  System.Console.WriteLine(a.Name + " " + a.Address1_City);
 }
}

```
  
## Using a Picklist to Order By  

The following sample shows use of a lookup value to order by.  
  
```csharp

using (ServiceContext svcContext = new ServiceContext(_serviceProxy))
{
 var query_orderbypicklist = from c in svcContext.ContactSet
                             where c.LastName != "Parker" &&
                             c.AccountRoleCode != null
                             orderby c.AccountRoleCode, c.FirstName
                             select new
                             {
                              AccountRole = c.FormattedValues["accountrolecode"],
                              c.FirstName,
                              c.LastName
                             };
 foreach (var c in query_orderbypicklist)
 {
  System.Console.WriteLine(c.AccountRole + " " +
   c.FirstName + " " + c.LastName);
 }
}
```
