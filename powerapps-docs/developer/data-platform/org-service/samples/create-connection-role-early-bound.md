## What this sample does

This sample shows how to create a connection role that can be used for accounts and contacts.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. Defines some anonymous types to define the range of possible connection property values.
2. Creates a connection role for account and contact entity.
3. Creates a connection role object type code record for account and contact entity.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
