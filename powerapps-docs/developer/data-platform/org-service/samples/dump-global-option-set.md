# Sample: Dump global choices information to a file

This sample shows how to write out all the choices column definitions to an `XML` file. It uses the [RetrieveAllOptionSetsRequest](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.retrievealloptionsetsrequest) message.

> [SDK for .NET: Dump choices information to a file sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/C%23/DumpGlobalOptionSetInfo)

The following sample creates a new file at `\DumpGlobalOptionSetInfo\bin\Debug\AllOptionSetValues.xml`. You can open this file in **Office Excel** to see a tabular report.

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `RetrieveAllOptionSetsRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario that contains data that is needed to retrieve column definitions information about all the choices.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `RetrieveAllOptionSetsRequest` method retrieves the metadata.
1. The `StreamWriter` creates an instance of StreamWriter to write text to a file.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No cleanup is required.
