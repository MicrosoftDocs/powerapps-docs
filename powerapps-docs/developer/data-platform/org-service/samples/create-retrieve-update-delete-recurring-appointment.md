# Sample: Create, retrieve, update, and delete a recurring appointment



This sample shows how to create, retrieve, update, and delete a recurring appointment series. This sample uses the following common methods:

- [IOrganizationService.Create](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.create)
- [IOrganizationService.Retrieve](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.retrieve)
- [IOrganizationService.Update](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.update)
- [IOrganizationService.Delete](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.delete)

You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/CRUDRecurringAppointment).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `IOrganizationService` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that provides programmatic access to the metadata and data for an organization.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. Define anonymous types to define the possible recurrence pattern values, possible values for days of the week and possible values for the recurrence rule pattern end type. 
1. The `RecurringAppointmentMaster` method creates a recurring appointment.
1. The `QueryExpression` method retrieves the newly created recurring appointment.
1. The `Update` method updates the subject, number of occurrences to 5, appointment interval to 2 for the retrieved recurring appointment.


### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records created in the [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the tables and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
