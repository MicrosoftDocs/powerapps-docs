# Work with columns definitions



This sample shows how to perform various actions on columns. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/WorkWithAttributes).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to create different types of columns in Microsoft Dataverse.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `BooleanAttributeMetadata` method creates a column of type boolean.
2. The `DateTimeAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type date time.
3. The `DecimalAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type decimal.
4. The `IntegerAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type integer.
5. The `MemoAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type memo.
6. The `MoneyAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type money.
7. The `PicklistAttributeMetadata` message creates a column of type choices.

### Clean up

Displays an option to delete all the data created in the sample. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the data created by the sample. You can manually delete the data to achieve same results.
