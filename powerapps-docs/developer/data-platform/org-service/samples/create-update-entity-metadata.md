# Create and update table definitions

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This topic shows how to programmatically create a custom user-owned table called **Bank Account** and add four different types of columns to it.

You can also create organization-owned custom tables. More information: [Table ownership](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/introduction-entities#entity-ownership). You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/CreateUpdateEntityMetadata).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `CreateEntityRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains  the data that is needed to create a custom table, and optionally, to add it to a specified unmanaged solution.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `createrequest` method creates the custom table. 
2. The `Entity` method is used to define the table.
3. The `StringAttributeMetadata` method defines the primary column of the table.
4. The `CreateBankNameAttributeRequest` method creates a string column to the table.
5. The `CreateBalanceAttributeRequest` method creates a money column to the table.
6. The `CreateCheckedDateRequest` method creates a DateTime column to the table.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records created in the [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the tables and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
