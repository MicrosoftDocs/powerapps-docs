# Sample: SDK for .NET Use bulk operations

These sample applications on GitHub show how to perform bulk create and update operations using several different approaches including the use of [CreateMultipleRequest](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateMultipleRequest) and [UpdateMultipleRequest](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateMultipleRequest) classes. The messages for these request classes are optimized to provide the most performant way to create or update records with Dataverse.

This sample is a Visual Studio .NET 6.0 solution that contains five different projects that perform the same operations in different ways so that you can compare the performance of each method.

> [!NOTE]
> This solution also contains an [UpsertMultiple project](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/orgsvc/C%23-NETCore/BulkOperations/UpsertMultiple/README.md) that demonstrates the use of the [UpsertMultipleRequest class](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpsertMultipleRequest)

See the README.md file in each sample for detailed instructions about how to run the sample and what it does.
