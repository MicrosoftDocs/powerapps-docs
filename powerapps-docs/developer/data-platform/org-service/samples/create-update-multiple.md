# Sample: Use CreateMultiple and UpdateMultiple (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

These sample applications on GitHub show how to perform bulk create and update operations using several different approaches including the use of [CreateMultipleRequest](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateMultipleRequest) and [UpdateMultipleRequest](xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateMultipleRequest) classes. The messages for these request classes are optimized to provide the most performant way to create or update records with Dataverse.

This sample is a Visual Studio .NET 6.0 solution that contains five different projects that perform the same operations in different ways so that you can compare the performance of each method.

See the README.md file in each sample for detailed instructions about how to run the sample and what it does.
