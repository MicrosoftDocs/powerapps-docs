## What this sample does

This sample creates some sample data, to work with activity party records. 

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
1. Creates three contact records which are required for this sample.


### Demonstrate

1. Retrieves the contact records that are created in the [Setup](#setup). 
2. Creates the activity party records for each contact.
3. Also creates Letter activity and set **From** and **To** fields to the respective Activity Party entities.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records created during [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
