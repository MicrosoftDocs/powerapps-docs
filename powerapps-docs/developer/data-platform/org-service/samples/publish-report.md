[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This sample shows how to publish a report by creating a **Report** record and the related records that make it visible. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/PublishReport).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

In order to simulate the scenario described above, the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `Report` method instantiates the report object.
2. The `ReportCategory` method sets the report category te report should belong to.
3. The `ReportEntity` method defines which entity this report uses.
4. The `ReportVisibility` method sets the report visibility.
