# Sample: Retrieve valid status transitions

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This sample shows how to retrieve valid state transitions regardless of whether custom state transitions have been defined for the entity. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/RetrieveValidTransitions).
 
## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]


## What this sample does

The `GetValidStatusOptions` method is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that returns valid status option transitions regardless of whether state transitions are enabled for the entity.
## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
1. The `MetadataFilterExpression` method checks for the entity metadata.

### Demonstrate

1. The `MetadataFilterExpression` method retrieves the status options for the `Incident` entity.
1. The `RetrieveMetadataChangeRequest` method retrieves the metadata.
1. The `GetValidStatusOptions` method gets the valid status transitions for each status option.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No clean up is required.
