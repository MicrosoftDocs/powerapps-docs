# Sample: Retrieve valid status transitions

This sample shows how to retrieve valid state transitions regardless of whether custom state transitions have been defined for the table. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/C%23/RetrieveValidTransitions).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `GetValidStatusOptions` method is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that returns valid status option transitions regardless of whether state transitions are enabled for the table.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
1. The `MetadataFilterExpression` method checks for table definitions.

### Demonstrate

1. The `MetadataFilterExpression` method retrieves the status options for the `Incident` table.
1. The `RetrieveMetadataChangeRequest` method retrieves the metadata.
1. The `GetValidStatusOptions` method gets the valid status transitions for each status option.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No clean up is required.
