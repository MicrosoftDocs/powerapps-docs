# Sample: Make a report available or unavailable to organization

This sample shows how to make a report available or unavailable to an organization.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [SDK for .NET: Make a report available or unavailable to organization sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp/MakeReportAvailableToOrganization)

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described above, the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
2. The `CreateRequiredRecords` method creates records that this sample requires.

### Demonstrate

1. The `service.Retrieve` method retrieves existing personal report.
2. Set `IsPersonal` parameter to false.
3. The `service.Update` method makes the report available for the organization.
4. Set `IsPersonal` parameter to true. This makes the report unavailable for the organization.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data that is created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the tables and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
