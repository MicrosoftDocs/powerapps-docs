# Sample: Use rollup queries to track goals

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/sample-use-rollup-queries-track-goals -->

This sample shows how to use rollup queries to track goals. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/QueriesTrackGoals).

This sample requires additional three users that are not in your system. Create the three required users **as is** shown below manually in **Microsoft 365**. Replace `yourorg` with the organization name.

**First Name**: Nancy<br/>
**Last Name**: Anderson<br/>
**Security Role**: Salesperson<br/>
**UserName**: nanderson@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com<br/>

**First Name**: David<br/>
**Last Name**: Bristol<br/>
**Security Role**: Salesperson<br/>
**UserName**: dbristol@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com<br/>

**First Name**: Kevin<br/>
**Last Name**: Cook<br/>
**Security Role**: SalesManager<br/>
**UserName**: kcook@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com<br/>

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to use rollup queries to track goals.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
2. Retrieves the sales manager and 2 sales representatives, created manually in **Microsoft 365**.
3. Creates records to support `SalesOrder` records.
4. Creates a new unit group for the sample.
5. Retrieves the default unit id that is automatically created when we created a new unit group.
6. The `Product` creates few products that are required for the sample.
7. The `PriceLevel` creates a new price list.
8. The `ProductPriceLevel` creates a price list item for the first product and applies volume discount.
9. Creates an account record for the sales order's potential customer id. 
10. The `SalesOrderDetails` adds the product to the order with the price overridden with a negative value.

### Demonstrate

1. Creates Metric, and setting the Metric type to `Amount` and setting amount data type to `Money`.
2. The `RollupField` creates a rollup field which targets the actual totals.
3. The `GoalRollupQuery` creates the goal rollup queries, locating the sales orders in the first sales representative's area (zip code: 60661) and with a value greater than $1000. 
4. Creates two goals, one parent goal and one child goals.
5. The `RecalculateRequest` calculates the rollup for goals. 

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
