# IOrganizationService Interface

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../includes/cc-terminology.md)]

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface provides a set of methods used to perform the most common operations on system and custom tables and on the table definitions for your organization.

## Client applications

This interface is implemented in a number of classes that you can use in your code when creating client applications.

|Class|Description|
|--|--|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy>|This is the original low-level class which is used by WCF and the SOAP endpoint |
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.WebServiceClient.OrganizationWebProxyClient>|This low-level class was created to enable OAuth authentication to the SOAP endpoint|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient>|This is the class you should use when creating .NET client applications. |

> [!NOTE]
> You may find older code or samples using the low-level <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy> or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.WebServiceClient.OrganizationWebProxyClient> classes, but we recommend you use <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> for new .NET Client applications

## Plug-ins

When you write plug-ins, there is also an object returned from the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(System.Nullable{System.Guid})> which implements the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface but is not any of the types in the classes above.

## IOrganizationService Methods

Each of the classes which implement the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface may include additional properties and methods, but the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface has just 8 methods.


|Method  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Associate*>|Link two table rows using a table relationship|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Create*>|Create a table row.|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Delete*>|Delete a table row|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Disassociate*>|Remove the link between two table rows using a table relationship|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*>|Invoke an operation defined as a message by passing an instance of an <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> or a class derived from it.|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Retrieve*>|Retrieve an instance of a table row.|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple*>|Retrieve a collection of table rows that match the criteria set in a query.|
|<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*>|Change the column values of a table row.|

> [!NOTE]
> The Organization service exposes only the `Execute` method. The other methods in the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface are simply wrappers around the `Execute` method. These other methods are provided for convenience. You can perform all operations using only the `Execute` method. More information: [Use messages with the Organization service](use-messages.md)
