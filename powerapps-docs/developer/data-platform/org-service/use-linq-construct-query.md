# Use LINQ to construct a query

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The .NET Language-Integrated Query(LINQ) query provider in Microsoft Dataverse uses standard LINQ syntax. The first step in creating a LINQ query is to identify the relevant entity types and the relationships between them. You can then specify the data source and the other query parameters.  

 The `from` clause is used to return a single “root” entity. The query provider can only return entities of a single entity type. The `orderby` and `select` clauses must reference this root entity. You can use `join` clauses to add entities with a relationship to the “root” entity.

## LINQ operators  
 All LINQ query expressions have a similar format. The following table shows the most common clauses in a LINQ query expression when using the Dataverse LINQ query provider.  

### from  
 When using the generated service context and early binding, use the `IQueryable` entity set, such as `AccountSet`, in the generated context.  

 When not using the generated context, the `CreateQuery` method on the organization service context object gives you access to Dataverse entities.  

 Example:  

 Using the generated service context:  

```csharp  
var query1 = from c in context.ContactSet  
select c;  
```  

 Using the `CreateQuery` method:  

```csharp  
var query1 = from c in context.CreateQuery<Contact>()  
select c;  
```  

### join  
 The `join` clause represents an inner join. You use the clause to work with two or more entities that can be joined with a common attribute value.  

 Example:  

```csharp  
from c in context.ContactSet  
join a in context.AccountSet on c.ContactId equals a.PrimaryContactId.Id  
```  

### where  
 The `where` clause applies a filter to the results, often using a Boolean expression. The filter specifies which elements to exclude from the source sequence. Each `where` clause can only contain conditions against a single entity type. A composite condition involving multiple entities is not valid. Instead, each entity should be filtered in separate `where` clauses.  

 Example:  

```csharp  
from a in context.AccountSet  
where (a.Name.StartsWith("Contoso") && a.Address1_StateOrProvince == "WA")  
```  

### orderby  
 The `orderby` operator puts the returned query attributes in a specified order.  

 Example:  

```csharp  
var query1 = from c in context.CreateQuery<Contact>()     
    orderby c.FullName ascending     
    select c;  
foreach ( var q in query1)     
{  
    Console.WriteLine(q.FirstName + " " + q.LastName);     
}  
```  

### select  
 The `select` clause defines the form of the data returned. The clause creates a column set based on the query expression results. You can also define an instance of a new object to work with. The newly created object using the `select` clause is not created on the server, but is a local instance.  

 Example:  

```csharp  
select new Contact     
{  
    ContactId = c.ContactId,  
    FirstName = c.FirstName,  
    LastName = c.LastName,  
    Address1_Telephone1 = c.Address1_Telephone1     
};  
```

## LINQ limitations  

 The LINQ query provider supports a subset of the LINQ operators. Not all conditions that can be expressed in LINQ are supported. The following table shows some of the limitations of the basic LINQ operators.

## Filter multiple entities  

 You can create complex .NET Language Integrated Query(LINQ) queries in Dataverse. You use multiple `Join` clauses with filter clauses to create a result that is filtered on attributes from several entities.  

 The following sample shows how to create a LINQ query that works with two entities and filters the result based on values from each of the entities.  

 ```csharp
 using (ServiceContext svcContext = new ServiceContext(_serviceProxy))
{
 var query_where3 = from c in svcContext.ContactSet
                    join a in svcContext.AccountSet
                    on c.ContactId equals a.PrimaryContactId.Id
                    where a.Name.Contains("Contoso")
                    where c.LastName.Contains("Smith")
                    select new
                    {
                     account_name = a.Name,
                     contact_name = c.LastName
                    };

 foreach (var c in query_where3)
 {
  System.Console.WriteLine("acct: " +
   c.account_name +
   "\t\t\t" +
   "contact: " +
   c.contact_name);
 }
}
 ```
