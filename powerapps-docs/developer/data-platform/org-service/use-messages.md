# Use messages with the Organization service

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../includes/cc-terminology.md)]

All data operations in the organization service are defined as messages. While the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> provides seven methods to perform data operations (<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Create%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Retrieve%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Delete%2A>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Associate%2A>, and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Disassociate%2A> ), each of these methods is a convenience wrapper around the underlying message that is ultimately invoked using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute%2A> method. The underlying organization service only has the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute%2A> method which as a single parameter: an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> class. The value returned by the `Execute` method is an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse> class.

To make your experience better when you write code, all the standard system data operations have a pair of `*Request` and `*Response` classes defined in the SDK assemblies. Each of these classes inherits from the respective <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse> classes and provide a more productive experience for you when you write code.

The following examples show three different ways to create an account row defined this way:

```csharp
var account = new Account();
account.Name = "Test account";
```

Using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Create*>

```csharp
var id = svc.Create(account);
```

Using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateRequest> with <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*>

```csharp
CreateRequest request = new CreateRequest()
{ Target = account };
var id = ((CreateResponse)svc.Execute(request)).id;
```

Using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> with <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*>

```csharp
ParameterCollection parameters = new ParameterCollection();
parameters.Add("Target", account);

OrganizationRequest request = new OrganizationRequest() {
RequestName = "Create",
Parameters = parameters
};

OrganizationResponse response = svc.Execute(request);

var id = (Guid)response.Results["id"];
```

As you can see, common data operations have been streamlined using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> methods and system messages are made easier to use with the `*Request` and `*Response` classes in the SDK assemblies. Most of the time you don't need to use the underlying <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse> classes except for the following cases.

## Working with messages in plug-ins

The data describing an operation in a plug-in are in the form of <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.InputParameters> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.OutputParameters>. 

In the `PreValidation` and `PreOperation` stages before the main operation of the event pipeline, the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.InputParameters> represent the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest.Parameters>. After the main operation, in the `PostOperation` stage, the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.OutputParameters> represent the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse.Results>.

Understanding the structure of the messages helps you understand where to find the data you want to check or change within the plug-in.

## Using custom actions

When you use a custom action, there are no classes in the SDK assemblies for these operations. You can generate classes for them using:

- For .NET projects using [PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.ServiceClient](xref:Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.ServiceClient), use the [pac modelbuilder](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/modelbuilder) command that is part of the [Power Platform CLI](/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction). Use the [--generateActions](/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/modelbuilder#--generateactions--a) parameter to generate classes for custom actions.
- For .NET Framework projects, such as plug-ins, use `CrmSvcUtil.exe` code generation tool by using the `generateActions` parameter.


Alternatively, you can instantiate an <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest> instance and set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest.RequestName> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest.Parameters> to use them without the generated classes. To work with the results, you'll parse the values returned from the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse.Results> property.

## Passing optional parameters with a request

There are several optional parameters you can pass to apply special behaviors to messages. More information: [Use optional parameters](../optional-parameters.md)

## Private Messages

Microsoft Dataverse contains some messages that aren't intended for third party developers to use. Microsoft added these messages enable feature functionality, but third party solutions can also add them with the Custom API feature. The [SdkMessage.IsPrivate](../reference/entities/sdkmessage.md#BKMK_IsPrivate) property tells you which messages are private.

> [!CAUTION]
> You should not use private messages unless you created them as a Custom API. By marking a message as private, the solution publisher is explicitly calling out that they do not support other apps to use the message. They may remove the message or introduce breaking changes at any time. Use of these messages by anyone other than the solution publisher are not supported.
> Calling private messages from plug-ins is not supported.
