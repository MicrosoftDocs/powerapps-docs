# Subscribe to SDK assembly updates using NuGet

Microsoft Dataverse SDK for .NET assemblies and some command-line tools are available through a software distribution website called [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org). Use of NuGet packages in your application project enables you to keep your project up-to-date with the latest releases of the SDK assemblies and tools. Visual Studio has supported this capability since version 2010 and there is even a standalone NuGet client for those developers that donâ€™t develop in Visual Studio. Another advantage of using NuGet packages in your projects is that assembly references and dependencies are automatically taken care of for you.

## Where to find the NuGet SDK packages

The complete list of available Dataverse SDK packages are found under the [crmsdk](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/crmsdk) profile on the NuGet site.
