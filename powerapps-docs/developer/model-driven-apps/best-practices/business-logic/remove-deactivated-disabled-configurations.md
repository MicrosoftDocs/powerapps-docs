## Guidance

Ensure that each solution component that is deactivated, or disabled, has been done so intentionally.  If so and will no longer be utilized, consider removing it from the solution to prevent confusion for users and system customizers. These components include:

- SDK Message Processing Steps
- Processes
- Record Creation and Update Rules
- SLAs

As well as table components such as:

- Forms
- Views
- Business Rules
