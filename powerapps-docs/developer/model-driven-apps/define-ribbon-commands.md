# Define ribbon commands

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/customize-dev/define-ribbon-commands -->

A *Ribbon* command creates a reusable definition that can be referenced by ribbon control elements.  
  
## Ribbon command elements  
 The `<CommandDefinition>` element defines a command in the ribbon. The `Id` attribute specifies a unique identifier for the command that can be referenced by ribbon control elements by using the `Command` parameter.  
  
 A ribbon command defines three things:  
  
- **Enable Rules**: Specifies when a specific ribbon control is enabled.  
  
- **Display Rules**: Specifies when a specific ribbon element is visible.  
  
- **Actions**: Specifies what code executes when a ribbon control is used.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  All command definitions are downloaded to a user's computer so that they can be evaluated at run time. This means that a user without the privileges to see a particular control in the ribbon can use the browser **View Source** command, review the code, and determine that a control exists that isnâ€™t displayed to them.
