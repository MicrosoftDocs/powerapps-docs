## Export the ribbon  

You export the ribbon by including it in a solution and then exporting the solution. You can export all the customizations, but that can represent a large amount of data. We recommend that you use an existing unmanaged solution or create a new solution.  

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../data-platform/includes/cc-terminology.md)]

#### Create a new solution  
  
1. Go to **Settings > Customizations**.
1. Go to **Settings > Solutions**.
1. Select **New**.  
1. Type a meaningful **Display Name**, **Name** and enter a **Publisher** and type a **Version** number.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  You can usually use the default publisher for the organization.  
  
1. Select the **Save** icon.  
  
1. If you want to edit the ribbon for specific tables:  
  
   1. Select **Add Existing** and then select **Entity**.  
  
   2. Select the tables you want to include in the solution and then select **OK**.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       > For the purpose of editing table ribbons, you do not have to include required components. If you intend to export this solution and apply it to another system, you should include required components.  
  
1. If you want to edit global ribbons or add a custom group to all tables, select **Add Existing** and then select **Application Ribbons**.  
  
1. Select **Save and Close**.  
  
#### Use an existing solution  
  
1. Go to **Settings > Customizations**.
1. Go to **Settings > Solutions**. 
1. Double-click a solution to open it.  
  
1. If you want to edit the ribbon for specific tables:  
  
   1. Select **Add Existing** and then click **Entity**.  
  
   2. Select the tables you want to include in the solution and then select **OK**.  
  
       > [!NOTE]
       > For the purpose of editing table ribbons, you do not have to include required components. If you intend to export this solution and apply it to another system, you should include required components.  
  
1. If you want to edit global ribbons, such as to add custom button to all tables: select **Add Existing** and then select **Application Ribbons**.  
  
1. Select **Save and Close**.  
  
#### Export the ribbon  
  
1. Go to **Settings > Customizations**.
1. Go to **Settings > Solutions**.
  
1. Select the solution you want and then select **Export**.  
  
1. If you have made recent changes that have not yet been published, select **Publish All Customizations**. Otherwise, select **Next**.  
  
1. With the **Unmanaged** option selected, select **Export**.  
  
1. Select **Save** in the **File Download** dialog box and then select **Open Folder** in the **Download complete** dialog box.  
  
1. Right-click the compressed .zip file that you downloaded and select **Extract All...** .  
  
1. Select a location to extract the files and then select **Extract**.  
  
1. The customizations.xml file is the file that you will edit.

## Prepare to edit the XML  
 or a better experience, edit the customizations.xml file with an application that can use schema validation to provide IntelliSense support. For more information, see [Edit the customizations file with schema validation](edit-customizations-xml-file-schema-validation.md).  
  
<a name="BKMK_ImportTheRibbon"></a>

## Import the ribbon  
  
1. After you have edited the customization.xml file, from Visual Studio or Visual Web Developer 2010 Express, right-click the customization.xml tab and select **Open Containing Folder**.  
  
1. Select all of the files or folders that were included when you extracted the solution. Right-click the selected files, select **Send to**, and then select **Compressed (zipped) folder**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  This creates a compressed .zip file in the same folder. The name of the file may vary, but it will be the same as one of the other files in the folder - except with a .zip file name extension.  
  
1. Go to **Settings > Customizations**.
1. Go to **Settings > Solutions**. 
  
1. Select **Import**.  
  
1. Select **Browse** and locate the compressed .zip file that you created in step 2 of this procedure.  
  
1. Select **Next** and then select **Import**.  
  
1. After the import has finished, you will see the message indicating that the import completed successfully. Select **Close**.  
  
1. After you have successfully imported your solution, you must publish customizations before you can see the changes. In the solutions list, select **Publish All Customizations**.

### Dealing with errors on import  
  
1. If you receive a notification that there were errors that caused the import to fail, select **Export Log**.  
  
2. Save the export log file. Select the file and right-click it. Click **Open With** and then select **Microsoft Office Excel**.  
  
3.  Select the **Components** worksheet and note any messages in the **ErrorText** column.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    > The most common type of failure is an error when referencing a dependent element in the RibbonDiffXml. Perhaps you forgot to include a LocLabel that was referenced somewhere. Perhaps there is an extra blank character included at the end of an XML parameter referencing another element. All references must match exactly.  
  
4. After you have corrected the error, complete the steps to import the ribbon again.
