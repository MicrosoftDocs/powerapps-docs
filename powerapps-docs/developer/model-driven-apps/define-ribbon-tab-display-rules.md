# Define ribbon tab display rules

[!INCLUDE [cc-modern-commanding](../data-platform/includes/cc-modern-commanding.md)]

Tab display rules control whether a specific tab is displayed for a ribbon or not.  
  
Unlike other ribbon elements like groups or specific controls, you must explicitly provide a tab display rule for a tab to be displayed in the ribbon. By default, other ribbon elements will always display unless a display rule removes them.  
  
 `<TabDisplayRule>` elements require that the `TabCommand` parameter matches a `<Tab>` `Command` value.  
  
In the `RibbonDiffXml`, tabs can be defined for specific tables or defined globally. If the tab is defined for a table, the only valid type of rule is `<EntityRule>`. Because defining a tab in the scope of a particular table already limits the tab to only that table, the only valid parameters are `AppliesTo` (`PrimaryEntity` or `SelectedEntity`) and `Context` (`Form`, `HomePageGrid`, `SubGridStandard`, or `SubGridAssociated`).  

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../data-platform/includes/cc-terminology.md)]

When you define a tab display rule globally in the `RibbonDiffXml` for the application ribbons, you can apply both `EntityRule` elements and `<PageRule>` elements.
