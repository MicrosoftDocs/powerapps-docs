# Model-driven apps Developer Guide

Model-driven apps are primarily a no-code or low-code component focused approach to app development. The value developers can provide is by extending the application. Before you start writing code, begin with [learning how to build Model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-components) and what options can be applied without code.

> [!NOTE]
> Model-driven apps connect to Common Data Service. For information about how developers can add value at the service level, see [Common Data Service Developer Overview](../common-data-service/overview.md).
>
> Content in this section will refer only to extensions developers can do that apply to the experience for users of model-driven apps. 

If you are new to the Common Data Service applications, the topics in this section provides a high-level overview of the important concepts to help developers get started working with model-driven apps.
