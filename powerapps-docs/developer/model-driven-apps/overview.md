# Model-driven Apps Developer Guide

PowerApps offers users, businesses, partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs) a powerful platform for building line-of-business apps. The new addition to PowerApps in this release are model-driven apps built using the new Common Data Service for Apps. Common Data Service for Apps now contains the core functionality of the applications. With Model-driven Apps, you can build apps that use the same extensibility capabilities as those applications.

Model-driven Apps are primarily a no-code or low-code component focused approach to app development. The value developers can provide is by extending the application. Before you start writing code, begin with [learning how to build Model-driven Apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-components) and what options can be applied without code. 

If you are already experienced with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps, you will find that you will be able to apply your experience building Model-driven Apps. There are some new designers available to you, but generally the concepts are the same.

> [!NOTE]
> Model-driven Apps connect to Common Data Service for Apps. For information about how developers can add value at the service level, see [Common Data Service for Apps Developer Overview](../common-data-service/overview.md).
> Content in this section will refer only to extensions developers can do that apply to the experience for users of Model-driven Apps. 

If you are new to the Common Data Service for Apps applications, the topics in this section provides a high-level overview of the important concepts to help developers get started working with model-driven apps.
