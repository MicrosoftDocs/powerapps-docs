# Client API execution context

The execution context defines the event context in which your code executes. The execution context is passed when an event occurs on a form or grid, which you can use it in your event handler to perform various tasks such as determine [formContext](clientapi-form-context.md) or [gridContext](clientapi-grid-context.md), or manage the save event. 

The execution context is passed in one of the following ways:

- **Defining event handlers using UI**: The execution context is an *optional* parameter that can be passed to a JavaScript library function through an event handler. Use the **Pass execution context as first parameter** option in the **Handler Properties** dialog while specify the name of the function to pass the event execution context. The execution context is the first parameter passed to a function.

- **Defining event handlers using code**: The execution context is automatically passed as the first parameter to functions set using code. For a list of methods that can be used to define event handlers in code, see [Add or remove functions to events using code](events-forms-grids.md#add-or-remove-event-handler-function-to-event-using-code). 

The execution context object provides a number of methods to further work with the context. More information: [Execution context (Client API reference)](reference/execution-context.md)
