# formContext.ui.sections (Client API reference)



A section contains methods to manage how it appears as well as accessing the tab that contains the section.

You can retrieve a section object (say **sectionObj**) by using the following example code:

```JavaScript
var tabObj = formContext.ui.tabs.get(arg);
var sectionObj = tabObj.sections.get(arg);
```

## Properties

- **controls**: The section controls collection provides access to the controls within a section. See [Collections (Client API reference)](collections.md) for information about the methods exposed by collections. See [Controls (Client API reference)](controls.md) for information about the properties and methods exposed by the objects in this collection.
