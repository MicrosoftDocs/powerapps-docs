# setNotification (Client API reference)

Displays an error message for the control to indicate that data isn't valid. When this method is used,  a red "X" icon appears next to the control. On Dynamics 365 mobile clients, tapping on the icon will display the message.

> [!NOTE]
> Always make sure that the control you are using `setNotification` with is visible on the form.
>
>`setNotification` will not return an error if you use it on a control that is visible but is within a section or tab that isn't visible. When saving a record `setNotification` will display a message at the top of the form as a validation error. If the control is not visible because it is within a hidden parent section or tab, the user cannot fix this.
