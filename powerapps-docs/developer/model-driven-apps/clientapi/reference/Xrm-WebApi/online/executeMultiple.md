# Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[./includes/executeMultiple-description.md](./includes/executeMultiple-description.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This method is supported only for the online mode ([Xrm.WebApi.online](../online.md)). 

If you want to execute multiple requests in a transaction, you must pass in a change set as a parameter to this method. [Change sets](../../../../../data-platform/webapi/execute-batch-operations-using-web-api.md#change-sets) represent a collection of operations that are executed in a transaction. You can also pass in individual requests and change sets together as parameters to this method.

> [!NOTE]
> - You cannot include read operations (retrieve, retrieve multiple, and Web API functions) as part of a change set; this is as per the OData v4 specifications.
> - Requests can contain up to 1000 individual requests and cannot contain other batches. More information: [Execute batch operations](../../../../../data-platform/webapi/execute-batch-operations-using-web-api.md).

## Syntax

**Execute multiple requests:**

```JavaScript
var requests = [req1, req2, req3];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

**Execute multiple requests in a transaction:**

In this case, `req1`, `req2`, and `req3` will be executed in transaction.

```JavaScript
var changeSet = [req1, req2, req3];
var requests = [changeSet];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```


**Execute a mix of individual requests and multiple requests in a transaction:**

In this case, `req1`, `req2`, and `req3` will be executed in transaction, but `req4` and `req5` will be executed individually.

```JavaScript
var changeSet = [req1, req2, req3];
var requests = [req4, req5, changeset];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

## Parameters

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`requests`|Array of objects|Yes|An array of one of the following types:<br /><br />**Objects** where each object is an action, function, or CRUD request that you want to execute against the Web API endpoint. Each object exposes a [getMetadata method](execute.md#requestgetmetadata-method) that lets you define the metadata for the action, function, or CRUD request you want to execute. This is the same object that you pass in the [execute method](execute.md).<br /><br />**Change set** (an array of objects), where each object in the change set is as defined above. In this case, all the request objects specified in the change set will get executed in a transaction.<br /><br />See request examples in the [Syntax section](#syntax) for more information.|
|`successCallback`|Function|No|A function to call when operation is executed successfully. An array of response objects are passed to the function. See [Return Value](#return-value)|
|`errorCallback`|Function|No|A function to call when the operation fails.|

## Return Value

On success, returns a promise containing an array of objects to the `successCallback`. The objects have these properties:

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|---|---|---|---|

|`text`|Promise|No|Response body in plaintext format. |
|`headers`|Object|Yes|Response headers.|
|`ok`|Boolean|Yes|Indicates whether the request was successful.|
|`status`|Number|Yes|Numeric value in the response status code. For example: `200`|
