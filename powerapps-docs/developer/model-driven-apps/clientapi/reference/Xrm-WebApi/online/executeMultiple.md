# Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[./includes/executeMultiple-description.md](./includes/executeMultiple-description.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This method is supported only for the online mode ([Xrm.WebApi.online](../online.md)). 

If you want to execute multiple requests in a transaction, you must pass in a change set as a parameter to this method. [Change sets](../../../../../common-data-service/webapi/execute-batch-operations-using-web-api.md#change-sets) represent a collection of operations that are executed in a transaction. You can also pass in individual requests and change sets together as parameters to this method.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot include read operations (retrieve, retrieve multiple, and Web API functions) as part of a change set; this is as per the OData v4 specifications.

## Syntax

**Execute multiple requests:**

```JavaScript
var requests = [req1, req2, req3];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

**Execute multiple requests in a transaction:**

In this case, `req1`, `req2`, and `req3` will be executed in transaction.

```JavaScript
var changeSet = [req1, req2, req3];
var requests = [changeSet];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```


**Execute a mix of individual requests and multiple requests in a transaction:**

In this case, `req1`, `req2`, and `req3` will be executed in transaction, but `req4` and `req5` will be executed individually.

```JavaScript
var changeSet = [req1, req2, req3];
var requests = [req4, req5, changeset];
Xrm.WebApi.online.executeMultiple(requests).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

Each object exposes a <b>getMetadata</b> method that lets you define the metadata for the action, function or CRUD request you want to execute. This is the same object that you pass in the <code>execute</code> method. For information about the object, see <a href="execute.md">execute</a>.</li>
<li>Change set (an array of objects), where each object in the change set is as defined above. In this case, all the request objects specified in the change set will get executed in a transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>See request examples earlier in the **Syntax** section for more information.</p>
