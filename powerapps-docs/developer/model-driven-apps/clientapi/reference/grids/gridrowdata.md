# GridRowData (Client API reference)



GridRowData is returned by the [GridRow](gridrow.md).[getData](gridrow/getData.md) method.

GridRowData also provides methods for retrieving information specific to a record displayed in an editable grid row, including a collection of all the columns included in the row. Column data is limited to the columns presented by the editable grid. See [Collections (Client API reference)](../collections.md) for information on the methods available to access data in a collection.

```JavaScript
var myRows = gridContext.getGrid().getRows();
var myRow = myRows.get(arg);
var gridRowData = myRow.data;
```
