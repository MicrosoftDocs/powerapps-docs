# ViewSelector methods (Client API reference)



Provides methods to get or set information about the view selector of the subgrid control. If the subgrid control is not configured to display the view selector, calling the **ViewSelector** methods will throw an error.

ViewSelector is returned by the **gridContext**.[getViewSelector](gridcontrol/getViewSelector.md) method.

```JavaScript
var viewSelector = gridContext.getViewSelector();
```
