# Collections (Client API reference)

Collections are structures to provide access to data that represent an array, but without the ability to modify the data in the array. More information: [Collections in formContext object model](../clientapi-form-context.md#collections-in-the-formcontext-object-model)

These methods are available to all the collections in the `formContext` object model.
