# Collections (Client API reference)


Collections are structures to provide access to data that represent an array, but without the ability to modify the data in the array. More information: [Collections in formContext object model](../clientapi-form-context.md#collections-in-the-formcontext-object-model)

These methods are available to all the collections in the **formContext** object model.

|Method  |Description  |
|------|------|
|[forEach](collections/forEach.md)|[!INCLUDE[collections/includes/forEach-description.md](collections/includes/forEach-description.md)]|
|[get](collections/get.md)|[!INCLUDE[collections/includes/get-description.md](collections/includes/get-description.md)]|
|[getLength](collections/getLength.md)|[!INCLUDE[collections/includes/getLength-description.md](collections/includes/getLength-description.md)]|
