# formContext.data.process (Client API reference)



Provides events, methods, and objects to interact with the business process flow data on a form. See [formContext.ui.process (Client API reference)](formContext-ui-process.md) for methods to interact with the business process flow control on the form.

## Process events and event handler methods

Use the following events and event handler methods to write scripts for business process flows.

|Event | Event handler methods|
|--|--|
|[OnPreProcessStatusChange](events/onpreprocessstatuschange.md)|[addOnPreProcessStatusChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/addOnPreProcessStatusChange.md)<br/>[removeOnPreProcessStatusChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/removeOnPreProcessStatusChange.md)|
|[OnProcessStatusChange](events/onprocessstatuschange.md)|[addOnProcessStatusChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/addOnProcessStatusChange.md)<br/>[removeOnProcessStatusChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/removeOnProcessStatusChange.md)|
|[OnStageChange](events/OnStageChange.md)|[addOnStageChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/addOnStageChange.md)<br/>[removeOnStageChange](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/removeOnStageChange.md)|
|[OnStageSelected](events/OnStageSelected.md)|[addOnStageSelected](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/addOnStageSelected.md)<br/>[removeOnStageSelected](formContext-data-process/eventhandlers/removeOnStageSelected.md)|

## Active Process methods

Use these methods to retrieve information about the active process and set a different process as the active process.

|Name | Description |

## ProcessInstance methods

Use these methods to retrieve information about all the process instances for an entity record and to set a process instance as the active instance.

|Name | Description |
|--|--|

|[setStatus](formcontext-data-process/instance/setStatus.md)|[!INCLUDE[formcontext-data-process/instance/includes/setStatus-description.md](formcontext-data-process/instance/includes/setStatus-description.md)]|

## Active Stage methods

Use these methods to retrieve information about the active stage and set a different stage as the active stage.

|Name | Description |
|--|--|
|[getActiveStage](formcontext-data-process/activestage/getActiveStage.md)|[!INCLUDE[formcontext-data-process/activestage/includes/getActiveStage-description.md](formcontext-data-process/activestage/includes/getActiveStage-description.md)]|
|[setActiveStage](formcontext-data-process/activestage/setActiveStage.md)|[!INCLUDE[formcontext-data-process/activestage/includes/setActiveStage-description.md](formcontext-data-process/activestage/includes/setActiveStage-description.md)]|

## Stage methods 

A stage contains the data for a stage in a business process flow. Use the methods to access properties of the stage.

|Name | Description|
