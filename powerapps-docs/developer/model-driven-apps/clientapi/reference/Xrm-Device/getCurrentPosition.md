## Return Value
On success, returns a geolocation object with the attributes specified earlier in the **successCallback** function.

## Remarks
For the **getCurrentPosition** method to work, the geolocation capability must be enabled on your mobile device, and the model-driven apps mobile clients must have permissions to access the device location, which isn't enabled by default.

This method is supported only for the mobile clients.

## Example

```JavaScript
Xrm.Device.getCurrentPosition().then(
    function success(location) {
        Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog({
            text: "Latitude: " + location.coords.latitude +
            ", Longitude: " + location.coords.longitude
        });
    },
    function (error) {
        Xrm.Navigation.openAlertDialog({ text: error.message });
    }
);
```
