# Lookup Control PreSearch Event (Client API reference)



This event occurs just before the Lookup control launches a dialog to search for records. There is no UI to set event handlers for this event. You must use the [addPreSearch](../controls/addpresearch.md) and [removePreSearch](../controls/removepresearch.md) methods on the lookup control to add or remove event handlers for this event.

Use this event with other Lookup control methods to change the results displayed in a lookup based on the form data just before the lookup control shows search results for a user to choose from.
