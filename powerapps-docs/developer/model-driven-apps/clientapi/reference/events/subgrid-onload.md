# Subgrid OnLoad Event (Client API reference)



This event occurs every time the subgrid refreshes. This includes when users sort values in subgrid by clicking the column headings. 

Use the GridControl.addOnLoad and GridControl.removeOnLoad methods to manage event handlers, usually in the form Onload event.
