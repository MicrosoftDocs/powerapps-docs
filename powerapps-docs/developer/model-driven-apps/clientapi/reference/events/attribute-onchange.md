# Attribute OnChange Event (Client API reference)



The `OnChange` event occurs in the following situations:
- Data in a form field has changed and focus is lost. There is an exception to this behavior that applies to Two-Option (Boolean) fields that are formatted to use radio buttons or check boxes. In these cases the event occurs immediately.
- Data changes on the server are retrieved to update a field when the form is refreshed, such as after a record is saved.
- The attribute.[fireOnchange](../attributes/fireOnChange.md) method is used.

All fields support the `OnChange` event. Data in the field is validated before and after the `OnChange` event.

The `OnChange` event does not occur if the field is changed programmatically using the attribute.[setValue](../attributes/setValue.md) method. If you want event handlers for the `OnChange` event to run after you set the value you must use the `formContext.data.entity attribute.`[fireOnchange](../attributes/fireOnChange.md) method in your code. 

> [!NOTE]
> Although the **Status** field supports the`OnChange` event, the field is read-only on the form so the event cannot occur through user interaction. Another script could cause this event to occur by using the [fireOnchange](../attributes/fireOnChange.md) method on the field.

## Methods supported for this event
There are three methods you can use to work with the `OnChange` event for an attribute:
- [addOnChange](../attributes/addOnChange.md)
- [fireOnChange](../attributes/fireOnChange.md)
- [removeOnChange](../attributes/removeOnChange.md)
