# Form OnLoad Event (Client API reference)



The form `OnLoad` event occurs after the form has loaded. It cannot prevent the window from loading. Use the `OnLoad` event to apply logic about how the form should be displayed, to set properties on fields, and interact with other page elements.

When the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for tablets client is disconnected, the `OnLoad` event is the only event that will occur.
