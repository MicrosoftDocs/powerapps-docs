# OnPreStageChange event (Client API reference)

This event occurs **Before** the stage of a business process flow control changes. This event occurs after the user selects the **Next Stage**, **Move to previous stage** or **Set Active Stage** buttons in the user interface or when a developer uses the `formContext.data.process.moveNext`, `formContext.data.process.movePrevious`, or `formContext.data.process.setActiveStage` methods.

> [!NOTE]
> The OnPreStageChange event is supported only on Unified Interface.

From within a web resource script registered to the onPreStageChange event, a developer can invoke the following on the executionContext object passed into the web resource script: 

`executionContext.getEventArgs().preventDefault();` 

When you invoke `preventDefault`:

- The stage navigation will not be processed. The process instance will remain on the original stage.
- In a cross-table navigation, the form of the table of the destination stage will not open.
- The save of the main form will not be processed. If the main form was in a dirty state, it would remain in a dirty state.
- Any web resources that registered onStageChange will not be invoked.


An execution context object is passed to event handlers for this event. You can use the [getEventArgs](../executioncontext/getEventArgs.md) method to retrieve an object that has the following methods:

- **getDirection**: Returns a string that is either `Next` or `Previous` to show the direction of the stage change.
- **getStage**: Returns a stage object. Except when the navigation moves to a new table, the stage returned represents the destination stage object—that is, the next active stage. When the navigation moves to a new table, the stage is the stage being navigated from—that is, the previous active stage object. More information: [Stage methods](../formContext-data-process.md#stage-methods).
