# navigate (Client API reference)



[!INCLUDE[./includes/navigate-description.md](./includes/navigate-description.md)]

When you use the navigate method while unsaved changes exist, the user is prompted to save changes before the new form can be displayed. The **Onload** event occurs when the new form loads.

## Syntax

`formItem.navigate();`
