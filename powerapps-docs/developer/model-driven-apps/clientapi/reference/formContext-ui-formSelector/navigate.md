# navigate (Client API reference)

[!INCLUDE[](../../../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

When you use the navigate method while unsaved changes exist, the user is prompted to save changes before the new form can be displayed. The **Onload** event occurs when the new form loads.

## Syntax
