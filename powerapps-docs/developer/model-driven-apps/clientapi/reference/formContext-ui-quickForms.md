# formContext.ui.quickForms (Client API reference)

Provides methods to access all the quick view controls and its constituent controls on the model-driven apps forms when using the new form rendering engine (also called "turbo forms"). A quick view control is a quick view form added to a main form in model-driven apps that enables you to view information about a related table record within the main form. Data in constituent controls in a quick view control cannot be edited.

The **quickForms** collection provides access to all the quick view controls on a form, and supports all the standard methods of the collections. See [Collections](collections.md)) for information about the collection methods. 

You can retrieve a quick view control in the **quickForms** collection by using the [get](collections/get.md) method by specifying either the index value (integer) or name (string) of the quick view control as the argument:

`quickViewControl = formContext.ui.quickForms.get(arg)`
