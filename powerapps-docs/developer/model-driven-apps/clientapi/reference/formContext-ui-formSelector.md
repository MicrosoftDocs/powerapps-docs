# formContext.ui.formSelector (Client API reference)

The **formContext.ui.formSelector** property lets you work with form items where a form item represents a form that is available to a user because it is associated with a security role that the user is also associated to. Often there will be only one form. When more than one form is available, methods for a form item can be used to change the form the user is viewing.

Form Items are available through any of the following:

- **formselector.items** collection: A collection of all the form items accessible to the current user. Only those forms that share an association with one of the userâ€™s security roles are available in this collection. Example:
 
    `formItem = formContext.ui.formSelector.items.get(arg);`

    See [Collections](collections.md) for information about the collection methods.
 
    > [!NOTE]
    > This collection isn't available for [Dynamics 365 mobile clients (phones and tablets)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/overview).

- **formselector.getCurrentItem** method: Returns a reference to the form currently being shown. When only one form is available this method will return **null**. Example:
 
    `formItem = formContext.ui.formSelector.getCurrentItem();`

## Form Item methods

After retrieving a form item using one of the above ways, use the following methods to work with the form item.
