Provides a method to display a web page in the side pane of model-driven apps form.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Xrm.Panel** namespace was introduced in the December 2016 update for Dynamics 365 (online and on-premises), and the method under this namespace is a preview feature. A preview feature is a feature that is not complete, but is made available before it's officially in a release so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have limited or restricted functionality. We expect changes to this feature, so you shouldn't use it in production. Use it only in test and development environments. Microsoft doesn't provide support for this preview feature. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Technical Support won't be able to help you with issues or questions. Preview features aren't meant for production use and are subject to a separate [supplemental terms of use](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/Preview_Supplement_License_Terms_CRMOL_English.htm).
