# setActiveProcess (Client API reference)



[!INCLUDE[./includes/setActiveProcess-description.md](./includes/setActiveProcess-description.md)]

If the business process being set as active already has an instance, the instance will be marked as active and the primary record form will be reloaded to show it. If no instance exists for the process, a new instance is created, marked as active, and the primary record form will be reloaded to show it.

If multiple instances of the process exist, one of these will be chosen as per the defaulting logic to be marked as active. Typically, this is the most recently used process instance by the current user.

> [!NOTE]
> - The `setActiveProcess` method should be used while creating or editing a record. Use the `setActiveProcess` method to set the active process for a business process flow instead of `processId` and `processInstanceId` with `Xrm.Navigation.openForm` method . 
> - The `setActiveProcess` method will reload the form and any unsaved data will be lost.
