# getProgress (Client API reference)



[!INCLUDE[./includes/getProgress-description.md](./includes/getProgress-description.md)]

## Syntax

`var stepProgress = stepObj.getProgress();`

## Return Value

**Type**: Number. 

**Description**: Returns one of the following values:

|Value |Description|
|--|--|
|0|None|
|1|Processing|
|2|Completed|
|3|Failure|
|4|Invalid|

This method is supported only for the action steps; not for the data steps. Action steps are buttons on the business process stages that users can click to trigger an on-demand workflow or action. Action step is a preview feature introduced in the v9.0 release.
