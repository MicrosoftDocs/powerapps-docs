# CSS web resources

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/css-web-resources -->

Use cascading style sheet (CSS) web resources to create style sheets for use in webpage web resources.  
  
## Capabilities of CSS web resources 

 With CSS web resources, you can manage the appearance of webpage web resources by linking them to a shared library of CSS styles.  
  
### Limitations of CSS web resources  

 Like all web resources, CSS web resources are only available in the security context. Only licensed users who have the necessary privileges can access them.
  
## Referencing a style sheet web resource from a webpage web resource  

 All web resources can use relative URLs to reference each other. In the following example, for the webpage web resource `sample_/content/contentpage.htm` to reference the style sheet web resource `sample_/styles/styles.css`, add the following example to the head element of sample_/content/contentpage.htm:  
  
```html  
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../styles/styles.css" />  
```  
  
 To reference a style sheet from a different publisher, the path must include that solution publisher customization prefix. For example, for the `sample_/content/contentpage.htm` page to reference the `MyIsv_/styles/styles.css` page, the href parameter value should be `../../MyIsv_/styles/styles.css`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  References included in code between web resources arenâ€™t tracked as solution dependencies.
