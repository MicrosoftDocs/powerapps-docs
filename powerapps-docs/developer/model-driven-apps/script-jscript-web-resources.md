# Script (JScript) web resources

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/script-jscript-web-resources -->

Use Script(JScript) web resources to create a library of JavaScript functions that can be accessed from anywhere.  
  
<a name="BKMK_capabilities"></a>   
## Capabilities of script web resources  
 With JavaScript web resources, you can more efficiently manage code used in form scripts, webpage (HTML) web resources, or ribbon commands by linking them to shared library of JavaScript functions.  
  
<a name="BKMK_limitations"></a>   
## Limitations of script web resources  
 Like all web resources, JavaScript web resources use the model-driven apps security context. Only licensed users who have the necessary privileges can access them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  References included in code between web resources arenâ€™t tracked as solution dependencies.  
  
<a name="BKMK_Using"></a>   
## Using JavaScript libraries  
 For information about developing and testing JavaScript libraries as well as how to associate them with ribbon commands and form events, see [Client scripting using JavaScript](client-scripting.md).  
  
<a name="BKMK_Referencing"></a>   
## Referencing a script web resource from a webpage web resource  
 All web resources can use relative URLs to reference each other. In the following example, for the webpage web resource `new_/content/contentpage.htm` to reference the JavaScript web resource `new_/scripts/myScript.js`, add the following HTML code to the head element of `new_/content/contentpage.htm`.  
  
```html  
<script type="text/jscript" src="../scripts/myScript.js"></script>  
```  
  
 To reference a JavaScript from a different publisher, the path must include the customization prefix for that publisher. For example, for the `new_/content/contentpage.htm` page to reference the `MyIsv_/scripts/customscripts.js` page, the `src` attribute value should be `../../MyIsv_/scripts/customscripts.js`.
