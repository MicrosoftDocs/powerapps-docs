# Understand dashboards: Dashboard components and FormXML

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/customize-dev/understand-dashboards-dashboard-components-formxml -->

Dashboards are one of the different types of forms in model-driven apps. You can use the `SystemForm.Type` or `UserForm.Type` attribute to determine whether the form is a dashboard. A form of dashboard type has the property value of ”0”.  

 The definition of the form content and presentation is stored in the FormXML. More information: [Form XML Schema](form-xml-schema.md)  

 For sample FormXML strings for different types of dashboards, see [Sample Dashboards](sample-dashboards.md).

## Dashboard components  
 A dashboard can contain charts, grids, IFRAMEs, or web resources. By default, a single dashboard can contain up to six of these components.  

<!-- In the [!INCLUDE[pn_dynamics_crm](../../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] on-premises version, you can change the number of components to be displayed on a dashboard using [!INCLUDE[pn_PowerShell](../../includes/pn-powershell.md)]. More information: [Set the Number of Dashboard Controls](understand-dashboards-dashboard-components-formxml.md#set_controls_limit)-->

<!--[!INCLUDE[cc_sdk_onpremises_note](../../includes/cc-sdk-onpremises-note.md)]-->

### Charts  
 An organization-owned dashboard can contain only organization-owned charts. However, a user-owned dashboard can contain user-owned and organization-owned charts. More information [Charts (Visualizations) for model-driven apps](view-data-with-visualizations-charts.md)  

### Grids  
 Grids fetch data from queries (views) in model-driven apps. An organization-owned dashboard can contain only the grids that fetch data from saved queries. However, a user-owned dashboard can contain grids that fetch data from user and saved queries. More information: [SavedQuery Entity](../common-data-service/reference/entities/savedquery.md) 

### IFRAMEs  
 When you add an IFRAME to an organization-owned dashboard, you can specify whether to restrict or allow cross-frame scripting. 
 To do so, you have to use the `<Security>` parameter in the IFRAME control in the FormXML. However, for user-owned dashboards, cross-frame scripting for IFRAMEs is restricted, and you can’t change it. If you attempt to create a user-owned dashboard that contains an IFRAME with cross-frame scripting enabled, an error message will be displayed.  

### Web resources  
 Only form-enabled web resources can be included in a dashboard. Although this restriction is applicable when you are adding a web resource using the Dashboard designer in the web application, there is no such restriction applied when adding a web resource to a dashboard using the SDK. More information: [Web resources for model-driven apps](web-resources.md)

## Dashboard components and FormXML elements  
 The dashboard components are displayed in model-driven apps based on the values specified in the FormXML. The following image shows an example of a dashboard. Each dashboard can include multiple tabs. Tabs are a vertical stack separating the body of the dashboard, and can be expanded or collapsed. A tab can contain multiple sections. Sections enable for grouping and layout of dashboard components.

## FormXML elements supported for dashboards  

 Although dashboards are a type of forms, not all FormXML elements and attributes are supported by dashboards. The following table provides information about the FormXML elements, child elements, and attributes supported by dashboards.

 For sample FormXML for different types of dashboards, see [Sample Dashboards](sample-dashboards.md).
