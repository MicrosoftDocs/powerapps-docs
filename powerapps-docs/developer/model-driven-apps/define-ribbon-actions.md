# Define ribbon actions

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/customize-dev/define-ribbon-actions -->

Define the actions to be performed by a command bar or ribbon control in a `<CommandDefinition>` element together with rules that control whether the control is enabled or visible in the ribbon.  
  
 A Ribbon control can perform two types actions and may include multiple actions:  
  
- **JavaScript Functions**: A `<JavaScriptFunction>` element references a function defined in a [Script (JScript) web resource](/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/script-jscript-web-resources).  
  
- **Open a URL**: The ribbon opens a URL using the value from an Address attribute in the `<Url>` element. Additional parameters can pass information about how what querystring parameters are passed and the mode in which the window opens.  
  
     You have several options to pass parameters to a URL using the ribbon. More information: [Passing Parameters to a URL using the Ribbon](pass-parameters-url-by-using-ribbon.md)  
  
## Passing parameters to ribbon actions  

 Use the following elements to define data to pass to your custom action:  
  
 `<BoolParameter>`  
[!INCLUDE[ribbon_element_BoolParameter](../../includes/ribbon-element-boolparameter.md)]
  
 `<CrmParameter>`  
 [!INCLUDE[ribbon_element_CrmParameter](../../includes/ribbon-element-crmparameter.md)] More information: [Pass data from a page as a parameter to Ribbon Actions](pass-data-page-parameter-ribbon-actions.md) 
  
 `<DecimalParameter>`  
 [!INCLUDE[ribbon_element_DecimalParameter](../../includes/ribbon-element-decimalparameter.md)]
  
 `<IntParameter>`  
 [!INCLUDE[ribbon_element_IntParameter](../../includes/ribbon-element-intparameter.md)]
  
 `<StringParameter>`  
 [!INCLUDE[ribbon_element_StringParameter](../../includes/ribbon-element-stringparameter.md)]
  
 When parameters are passed to a `<Url>` element they are passed as a query string. Therefore, they must include a name value to represent the "key" in the query string key/value pair.  
  
 Parameters passed to a `<JavaScriptFunction>` do not require a name but they must be included in the order expected by the function and be of the correct data type.
