# PowerApps component framework for canvas apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is still experimental and disabled by default. For more information, see [Experimental and preview features](../../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-experimental.md).

PowerApps component framework enables app makers to create code components to use in an app or across the apps. More information: [PowerApps component framework overview](overview.md) 

In this experimental preview, PowerApps component framework enables app makers to create code components, debug, import, and add them to canvas apps using the PowerApps CLI tooling. Only specific APIs are supported in this experimental preview. It is recommended to check each API whether it supports canvas apps or not. 

> [!WARNING]
> Code components contain code that may not be generated by Microsoft and can potentially access security tokens and data. When adding code components to an app, make sure that the code component solutions are from a trusted source.

## Prerequisites

1. System Administrator privileges are required to enable the PowerApps component feature in the environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default PowerApps component framework is enabled for model-driven apps.

## Enable PowerApps component framework feature

To add code components to an app, you need to enable the PowerApps component framework feature in each environment where you want to use them. To enable an environment to use code components inside its apps:

1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/).

2. Click on the **Settings** icon and then select **Admin Center**.
    
    ![Settings admin center](media/select-admin-center-from-settings.png "Settings admin center") 

3. Select the environment where you want to enable this feature and click on **...** and then select **Settings**.

4. Under the **Products** tab, select **Features**.

   ![Enable PCF](media/enable-pcf-feature.png "Enable PCF")

5. From the list of available features, turn on the switch under the **PowerApps component framework for canvas apps**.

6. Now, open the app where you want to add the code component and navigate to **File** > **App settings** and select **Advanced settings**.

   ![Enable components for pcf](media/enable-components-for-pcf.png "Enable components for pcf")
   
7. Turn on the **Components** switch under the **Experimental feature** section.

## Implementing code components

After you enable the PowerApps component framework feature in your environment, you can start implementing the logic for code components. The [implement sample component](implementing-controls-using-typescript.md) topic demonstrates the step by step process to create code components right from implementing the custom logic, manifest file, debug process, creating a solution zip file, and importing the solution into Common Data Service.

> [!NOTE]
> Implementing code components is same for both model-driven apps and canvas apps (experimental preview). The only difference is adding the code components. 

## Add components to a canvas app

To add code components to a canvas app:

> [!NOTE]
> To add code components to a field or an entity for model-driven apps, see [Add code components to model-driven apps](add-custom-controls-to-a-field-or-entity.md)

1. Navigate to PowerApps Studio.
2. Create a new canvas app or edit an existing app that you want to add the code component.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure the solution zip file is already [imported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/import-update-export-solutions) into Common Data Service before you go onto the next step.

3. Click on **Insert** > **Components** > **Import component**. 
 
    ![Insert components](media/insert-components-import.png "Insert components")

4. Select **Code (experimental)** tab and add a component from the list and click on **Import**. This adds the sample component in the **Components** menu.

    ![Import sample component](media/import-component-add-sample-component.png "Insert sample component")

5. Navigate to **Components** and select the component to add it to the app.

   ![Add sample component](media/add-sample-component-from-list.png "Add sample component")

## Delete a code component 

To delete a code component from a canvas app, select the code component that you want to delete and press the **Delete** button on the menu. When the code component gets deleted from the app, all the code component elements get deleted from the app and the app package. 

## Updating existing code components

When you update the code components, we specify the *version* attribute in the manifest file, so that latest changes get reflected in the runtime. For canvas apps, when you update the existing code components, you don't need to update the *version* attribute. By design, the canvas apps pick up the latest code component and display it in runtime. Only a single version of the same component can exist in canvas apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing code components are updated only when the app is closed or reopened in the PowerApps Studio. When you reopen the app, it asks you to update the code components. Simply deleting the code components or adding the code component back into the app doesn't update the components.
