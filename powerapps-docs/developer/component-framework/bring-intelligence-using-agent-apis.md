# Bring intelligence into your component using Agent Xrm APIs

Agent APIs are a set of interfaces introduced in Microsoft Power Apps that allow components to interact with Topics created in Microsoft Copilot Studio. These APIs are available in two forms:

- Context.Copilot methods used for PCF controls. This is the subject of this article.
- [Xrm.Copilot namespace used for client scripts in model-driven apps.](../model-driven-apps/clientapi/bring-intelligence-using-agent-apis.md)

These APIs are designed to enhance integration with Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS), enabling more intelligent and responsive app experiences.

|API|Description|
|---------|---------|
|[copilot.executeEvent](reference/copilot/executeevent.md)|[!INCLUDE [executeevent-description](reference/copilot/includes/executeevent-description.md)]|
|[copilot.executePrompt](reference/copilot/executeprompt.md)|[!INCLUDE [executeprompt-description](reference/copilot/includes/executeprompt-description.md)]|

## Limitations

Agent APIs rely on the special agent associated with the model-driven app. This agent must be created from the App Designer experience using **Configure in Copilot Studio** in the navigation toolbar.

Topic needs to be created with the model-driven apps primary agent.

## Capabilities of Agent APIs

Agent APIs enable developers to either call a specific Topic in MCS or send a custom prompt to be processed by MCS. The response from either method is returned in a structured JSON format, which can then be used within the app for further processing or display. These APIs can be integrated into XRM events or embedded within custom PCF controls.

## Intended Usage

The primary purpose of Agent APIs is to simplify the process of integrating AI-driven interactions into model-driven apps. By allowing programmatic calls to MCS, developers can customize app behavior and enhance user experiences with intelligent responses, all while reducing the complexity of current integration methods.

## Evaluation and Performance Metrics

Agent APIs are evaluated based on the accuracy and relevance of the responses generated by MCS. These responses are also assessed to ensure they align with Microsoft's responsible AI principles, maintaining ethical and safe AI usage.

## Limitations and Best Practices

While Agent APIs offer powerful capabilities, their use is optional. Makers should carefully consider how to incorporate them into their customizations to ensure optimal performance and user experience. Understanding the limitations and planning accordingly can help minimize potential issues.

## Responsible and Effective Use

To ensure responsible use, makers must handle MCS responses appropriately within their customizations. This includes validating the accuracy and relevance of the AI-generated content. Additionally, it is strongly recommended to clearly indicate to users when AI is involved, similar to Microsoft's practice of displaying messages like "AI-generated content may be incorrect."
