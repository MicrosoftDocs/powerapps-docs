# Get tooling for PowerApps component framework

Use **Microsoft PowerApps CLI** (command-line interface) to create, debug, and deploy code components using PowerApps component framework. PowerApps CLI enables developers to create code components quickly and will in the future be expanded to include support for additional development and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) experiences. 

## What is Microsoft PowerApps CLI 

Microsoft PowerApps CLI is a simple, single-stop developer command-line interface which empowers the developers and app makers to create code components. PowerApps CLI tooling is the first step towards a comprehensive ALM story where the enterprise developers and ISVs can create, build, debug, and publish their extensions and customizations quickly and efficiently.  

## Install Microsoft PowerApps CLI

To get Microsoft PowerApps CLI, do the following:

1. Install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 LTS as it seems to be most stable.

1. Install [.NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462). 

1. If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of the options below:
   - Option 1: Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) or later.
   - Option 2: Install [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) and then install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

1. Install [Microsoft PowerApps CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).
1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update the PowerApps CLI tooling to the latest version using the command.

    ```CLI
    pac install latest
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - To deploy your code component using PowerApps CLI, you must have a Common Data Service environment with system administrator or system customizer privileges.
> - Currently, PowerApps CLI is supported only on Windows 10.

## Microsoft PowerApps CLI telemetry

The feature team is aggregating the telemetry to understand what features or capabilities developers most often use in the PowerApps CLI tool. The aggregated data allows us to provide the best experience to the customers by focusing on what’s truly is essential.

> [!NOTE]
> To disable the telemetry collection, run the command `pac telemetry --enable false`. To turn the telemetry back, use the command `pac telemetry --enable true`.

## Uninstall Microsoft PowerApps CLI

To uninstall the PowerApps CLI tooling, run the MSI from [here](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI). 

If you are Private Preview Participant and have an older version of CLI, follow these steps:

1. To find out where PowerApps CLI is installed, open a command prompt and type `where pac`.
1. Delete the PowerAppsCLI folder.
1. Open Environment Variables tool by running the command `rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables` in the command prompt.
1. Double-click on `Path` under `User variable for...` section
1. Select the row containing PowerAppsCLI path and click the Delete button on the right-hand side.
