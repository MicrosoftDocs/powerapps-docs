# Get tooling for Power Apps component framework

Use **Microsoft Power Platform CLI** (command-line interface) to create, debug, and deploy code components using Power Apps component framework. Microsoft Power Platform CLI enables developers to create code components quickly. In the future, it will be expanded to include support for additional development and application life cycle management (ALM) experiences. More information: [Install Microsoft Power Platform CLI](../data-platform/powerapps-cli.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To deploy your code component using Microsoft Power Platform CLI, you must have a Microsoft Dataverse environment with system administrator or system customizer privileges.
