# getOutputs

[!INCLUDE[./includes/getoutputs-description.md](./includes/getoutputs-description.md)]

## Available for 

Model-driven apps and canvas apps (public preview)

## Syntax

`getOutputs()`

## Remarks

The output will contain a value for each property with a usage as `bound` in the manifest.
For example, if the manifest has a property named `value` that has usage as `bound`, and you want to set that to the local variable `myvalue` then you should return:

```TypeScript
{
    value: myvalue
}
```

## Example

```TypeScript
public getOutputs(): IOutputs
{
    return {
        value: this._value
    };
}
```
