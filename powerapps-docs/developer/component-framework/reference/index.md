# Power Apps component framework API reference

This section contains reference documentation for creating code components using the Power Apps component framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The **Available for** tab shows which APIs are supported by model-driven apps and canvas apps (public preview). It is recommended to check the **Available for** section for each individual API methods whether it is supported or not. For example, the **client** API is supported for both model-driven apps and canvas apps, but the  **isOffline** method in **client** API supports only model-driven apps.
>
> - Using the `Xrm object` methods that are not exposed by the framework for developing code components is not supported.
