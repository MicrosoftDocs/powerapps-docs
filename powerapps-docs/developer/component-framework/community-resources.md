# Community resources for Power Apps component framework

The following is a list of some community resources created by the Power Apps community that you can use to create code components in model-driven and canvas apps using Power Apps component framework and Microsoft Power Platform CLI. 

> [!NOTE]            
> Resources created by the community are not supported by Microsoft. If you have questions or issues with community resources, contact the publisher of the resource. Before using these resources, you must ensure that these community resources meet the Power Apps component framework guidelines and should only be used for reference purpose. 

## Code components gallery

The Power Apps component framework gallery (<https://pcf.gallery/>) is a collection of code components created by the Power Apps community. It has a wide range of code components that may fit in for your business case. 

Make sure that you review the licensing terms and the source code before you download. See, [How to run the samples](use-sample-components.md) article on how to create a solution package and import into Microsoft Dataverse.

> [!WARNING]
> Code component run in the context of the end user who is using the component and can perform any action that may include accessing, capturing, and modifying the data.

## Tools

The [code component builder](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/plugins/Maverick.PCF.Builder/) is a tool that enables you to build code components with ease where you do not need to write the CLI commands but still use the [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli) under the hood. Most of the commands are consolidated, making it easier to build components. 

There are two versions of the code component builder. Both of them are called **PCF Builder** and are listed below:
1. [PCF Builder](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/plugins/Maverick.PCF.Builder/) for XrmToolBox.
2. [PCF Builder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danish-naglekar.pcf-builder) for Visual Studio Code.

[PCF Builder for XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/plugins/Maverick.PCF.Builder/) provides a graphical user interface that lets you create code components in visual manner using Microsoft Power Platform CLI.

[PCF Builder extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danish-naglekar.pcf-builder) provides a guided experience that not only lets  you create code components but you can preview code component inside of Visual Studio Code.
