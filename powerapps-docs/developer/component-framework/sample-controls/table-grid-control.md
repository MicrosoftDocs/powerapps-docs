# Implementing table grid component

This sample showcases how to create a basic dataset component, view's column metadata binding, record binding, more records from paging and record navigation to form.
The component header columns and internal record values are bound to the existing views. 

[!INCLUDE[cc-terminology](../../data-platform/includes/cc-terminology.md)]

## Available for 

Model-driven apps  

## Code 

You can download the complete sample component from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/component-framework/TableGrid).

Column Header bind to the View:

View column info lies at `context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].columns`. It's an array type.

Record binding:

- The sorted record IDs are at `context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].sortedRecordIds`
- All records info is at `context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].records` 
- For each record object, `context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].records[record_Id]` 
- Formatted value could be retrieved at `getFormattedValue` 

Load more pages of data if needed:

`context.parameters.[dataset_property_name].paging` provides paging functionality like `hasNextPage` and `loadNextPage` data. The `Load More` button is shown if it has next page data.

This sample also showcases how the component listens to the container resize. 

The `trackContainerResize` method should be called within [init](../reference/control/init.md) method so that the `mode.allocatedWidth` and `mode.allocatedHeight` is provided each time [updateView](../reference/control/updateview.md) being called. If this method isn't being called initially, then they don't have `allocatedWidth` and `allocatedHeight` provided.

If the allocatedHeight is â€“1, that means there's no limit on height. The component should adjust its height based on the provided width.
