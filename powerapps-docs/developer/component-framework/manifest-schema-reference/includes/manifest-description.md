Manifest is the metadata file that defines a component. It is an `XML` file that describes:

- The namespace of the component.
- The kind of data it can be configured, either a field or a data-set.
- Any properties that can be configured in the application when the component is added.
- A list of resource files that the component needs. 
  - One of them must be a TypeScript web resource. This TypeScript must include a function that will instantiate an object. This implements an interface that exposes methods that are required for the component to work. This is called the component implementation library.
- The name of a TypeScript function in the component implementation library that will return an object that applies the required component interface.

When the user configures a custom component in a canvas app or a model-driven app, the data in the manifest filters out the available components so that only the valid components for the context are available for configuration. The properties defined in the manifest for a component are rendered as configuration fields so that the user configuring the component can specify values. These property values are then available to the component function at run time.
