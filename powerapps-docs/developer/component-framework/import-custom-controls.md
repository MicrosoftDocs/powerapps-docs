# Package a code component

This topic demonstrates how to import code components into Common Data Service. After implementing the code components using the PowerApps CLI, the next step is to bundle all the code component elements into a solution file and import the solution file into Common Data Service so that you can see the code components in runtime.

Follow the steps below to create and import a solution file:

1. Create a new folder and name it as **Solutions** (you can choose any name of your choice) using the command `mkdir Solutions`. Navigate into the directory using the command `cd Solutions`.

2. Create a new solutions project using the command `pac solution init --publisher-name <enter your publisher name> --publisher-prefix <enter your publisher name>`. The solution project is used for bundling the code component into a solution zip file which is used for importing into Common Data Service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `publisher-name` and `publisher-prefix` values must be unique to your environment.
 
3. Once the new solution project gets created, you need to refer this **Solution** folder to the location where the created sample component is located. You can add the reference using the below command. This reference, informs the solution project about which code components should be added during the build, and you can add references to multiple components in a single solution project.

   ```CLI   
    pac solution add-reference --path <path to your PowerApps component framework project>
   ```

3. To generate a zip file from the solution project, you need to go into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild /t:build /restore`. This command uses *MSBuild* to build the solution project by pulling down the *NuGet* dependencies as part of the restore. Use the `/restore` only for the first time when the solution project is built. For every build afterwards, you can run the command `msbuild`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If msbuild 15.9.* is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 to run the `msbuild` commands.
    > - Building the solution in the *debug* configuration generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in *release* configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying `SolutionPackageType` property in `cdsproj` file.
    > - You can set the msbuild configuration to `Release` to issue a production build. Example: `msbuild /p:configuration=Release`.
    > - If you encounter an error that says *Ambiguous project name* when running the `msbuild` command on your solution. Then double-check that your solution name and project name are not the same.

4. The generated solution files are located inside the `\bin\debug\` folder after the build is successful.
5. Manually [import the solution into Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/import-update-upgrade-solution) using the web portal or see [Authenticating to your organization](#authenticating-to-your-organization) and [Deployment](#deploying-code-components) sections to import using PowerApps CLI commands.

## Authenticating to your organization

You can deploy the code components directly from the PowerApps CLI by authenticating to Common Data Service organization and then pushing the updated components. Follow the steps below to create the authentication profile, connect to Common Data Service, and push the updated components. 
 
1. Create your authentication profile using the command: 
 
    ```CLI
    pac auth create --url <your Common Data Service orgâ€™s url> 
    ```
 
2. If you have previously created an authentication profile, you can view all the existing profiles using the command: 

   ```CLI
    pac auth list 
   ```
 
3. To switch between the previously created authentication profiles, use the command: 
   
   ```CLI
    Pac auth select --index <index of the active profile>
    ``` 
 
4. To get the basic information about the organization, use the command below. The connection will made using the default authentication profile. 

    ```CLI
    pac org who 
    ```
 
5. To delete a particular authentication profile, use the command `pac auth delete --index < index of the profile >`. 
6. If you wish to clear all the authentication profiles from your local machine, use the command `pac auth clear`. This action is irreversible as it completely deletes the `authprofile.json` file and token cache file from your local machine. 

## Deploying code components 

After you have successfully created an authentication profile, you can start pushing the code components to the Common Data Service instance with all the latest changes. The `push` capability speeds up the inner-developer cycle development as it bypasses the code component versioning requirements and does not require that you build your solution (cdsproj) to import the code component. To use the `push` capability, follow below the steps below:

1. Ensure that you have a valid authentication profile created.
2. Navigate to the root directory where the code component project is created.
3. Run the command `pac pcf push --publisher-prefix <your publisher prefix>`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The publisher prefix that you use with the `push` command should match the publisher prefix of your solution in which the components will be included.

## How to remove components from a solution

If you wish to remove a code component from a solution file:

1.	Edit the `cdsproj` file in the solution project directory and remove the references to the component. Below is an example of a component reference:

```XML
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\pcf_component\pcf_component.pcfproj">
      <Project>0481bd83-ffb0-4b70-b526-e0b3dd63e7ef</Project>
      <Name>pcf_component </Name>
      <Targets>Build</Targets>
      <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
      <OutputItemType>Content</OutputItemType>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </ProjectReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

2. Perform a rebuild (or clean) using the command
   
    ```CLI
    msbuild /t:rebuild
    ```
