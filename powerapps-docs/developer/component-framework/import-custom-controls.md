# Package a custom component

This topic demonstrates how to import custom controls into Common Data Service. After developing custom controls using the PowerApps CLI, next step is to import those controls, so that you can see the controls in runtime.

Follow the steps below to create and import a solution file:

1. Create a new solution project in the directory of your choice by using the command `pac solution init --publisherName <enter your publisher name> --customizationPrefix <enter your publisher name>` after `cd <your new folder>`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `publisherName` and `cutomizationPrefix` values must be unique to your environment.
 
2. Once the new solution project is created, you need to refer to the location where the created control is located. You can add the reference by using the command
`pac solution add-reference --<path of your PowerApps component framework project on disk>`
3. To generate a zip file from your solution project, you will need to `cd` into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild/t:restore` and `msbuild`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If msbuild 15 is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for Vs 2017 to run the msbuild commands.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Building the solution in the debug configuration, generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in release configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying SolutionPackageType property in cdsproj file.

4. The generated solution files are located in `\bin\debug\`.
5. You should manually import the solution using the web portal.

## How to remove components from a solution

If you would like to remove a custom component from a solution, follow the steps below:

1.	Edit the cdsproj file in your solution project directory and remove the reference to the component. Below is an example of a component reference:

```XML
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\pcf_component\pcf_component.pcfproj">
      <Project>0481bd83-ffb0-4b70-b526-e0b3dd63e7ef</Project>
      <Name>pcf_component </Name>
      <Targets>Build</Targets>
      <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
      <OutputItemType>Content</OutputItemType>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </ProjectReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

2.	Perform a rebuild (or clean) by running the command
   ```CLI
   msbuild /t:rebuild
   ```
