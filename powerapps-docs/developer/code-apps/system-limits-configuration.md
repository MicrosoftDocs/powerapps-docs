# System configuration

This article contains information on the configuration for Power Apps code apps.

## Hosted app code

When a code app is published to Power Platform (e.g. when using pac code push) app code is hosted on a publicly accessible endpoint. Sensitive user or organizational data should not be stored in the app and they should be stored in a data source so the content is retrieved after end-users playing the app go through authentication and authorization checks. 

##  Configurable behavior

### Hide the Power Apps header when playing an app

You can hide the header that appears when playing an app adding 'hideNavBar=true' as a query string parameter. In practice, append this to the app link before sharing the app link. 

<pre>
https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/{environment id}/a/{app id}

https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/{environment id}/a/{app id}?<b>hideNavBar=true</b>
</pre>

## Development system requirements

### PAC CLI generated files must be editable by the developer

The files generated by PAC CLI in a code app project, e.g. power.config.json, must be editable by a developer for additional PAC CLI commands to work as expected. If system read or write privileges for a user are removed on files like power.config.json then PAC CLI code app commands will fail.
