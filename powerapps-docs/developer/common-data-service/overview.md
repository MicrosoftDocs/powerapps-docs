# Common Data Service for Apps Developer Guide

PowerApps offers users, businesses, independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs) a powerful platform for building line-of-business apps. The new addition to PowerApps in this release is the expansion of the Common Data Service, now called Common Data Service for Apps which now contains the core functionality of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement platform that powers Dynamics 365 for Sales, Marketing, Customer Service.

> [!NOTE]
