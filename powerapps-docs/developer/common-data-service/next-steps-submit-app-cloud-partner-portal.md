# Next steps: Submit your app on Partner Center

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Your app is ready for submission after completing steps 1-5. 

If you have completed access to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv), proceed to [create an offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/offer-creation-checklist) on Partner Center to submit your app.

All apps that are submitted to be listed on AppSource go through a certification process. For information about the checks done in the certification process, see [Appendix: App certification checklist](appendix-app-certification-checklist.md).
