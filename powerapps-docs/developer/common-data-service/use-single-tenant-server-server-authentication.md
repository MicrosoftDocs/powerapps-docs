# Use Single-Tenant server-to-server authentication


The single-tenant server-to-server scenario typically applies for enterprise organizations who have multiple Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps environments using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) for authentication. However, it can also be applied by environments when the application won't be distributed to other environments.  
  
 An enterprise can create a web application or service to connect to all the CDS for Apps environments for the single tenant.  
  
## Differences from multi-tenant scenario  
 Creating a web application or service for a single-tenant server-to-server authentication is similar to that used for a multi-tenant organization but there are some important differences.  
  
-   Because all the organizations are in the same tenant, there is no need for a tenant admin to grant consent. The application is already registered on the tenant.  
  
-   You have the opportunity to use certificates rather than keys if you prefer.
