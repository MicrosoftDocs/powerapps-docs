|    `TimeZoneDaylightDay`    |           First, second, third, fourth, or fifth occurrence of a *day* in a *month* when daylight takes effect for the user as per the local time zone. The *day* and *month* values are taken from the `TimeZoneDaylightDayOfWeek` and `TimeZoneDaylightMonth` attributes respectively to determine the effective date. System calculated based on the time zone specified for the user in the `TimeZoneCode` attribute.<br /><br /> For example, for the US Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone, consider the following attribute values:<br /><br /> -   `TimeZoneDaylightDay`: 2               //Denotes second occurrence<br />-   `TimeZoneDaylightDayOfWeek`: 0                         //Denotes first day of the week (Sunday)<br />-   `TimeZoneDaylightMonth`: 3               //Denotes 3rd month (March)<br /><br /> This implies that the daylight takes effect on 2nd Sunday of March, which is effectively March 8, 2015.           |

|    `TimeZoneStandardDay`    | First, second, third, fourth, or fifth occurrence of a *day* in a *month* when standard time takes effect for the user as per the local time zone. The *day* and *month* values are taken from the `TimeZoneStandardDayOfWeek` and `TimeZoneStandardMonth` attributes respectively to determine the effective date. System calculated based on the time zone specified for the user in the `TimeZoneCode` attribute.<br /><br /> For example, for the US Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone, consider the following attribute values:<br /><br /> -   `TimeZoneStandardDay`: 1               //Denotes first occurrence<br />-   `TimeZoneStandardDayOfWeek`: 0                         //Denotes first day of the week (Sunday)<br />-   `TimeZoneStandardMonth`: 11               //Denotes 11th month (November)<br /><br /> This implies that the standard time takes effect on 1st Sunday of November, which is effectively November 1, 2015. |
