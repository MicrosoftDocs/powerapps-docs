# Use connection strings in XRM tooling to connect to Common Data Service

With Common Data Service, XRM tooling enables you to connect to your Common Data Service environment by using connection strings. This is similar to the concept of connection strings used with **SQL Server**. Connection strings have native support in configuration files, including the ability to encrypt the configuration sections for maximum security. This enables you to configure Common Data Service connections at deployment time, and not hard code in your application to connect to your Common Data Service environment.  


<a name="Create"></a> 

## Create a connection string

 You specify the connection string in the `app.config` or `web.config` file for your project, as shown in the following example.  
  
```xml  
<connectionStrings>  
    <add name="MyCDSServer" connectionString="AuthType=OAuth;Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com;Password=passcode;Url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d;RedirectUri=app://58145B91-0C36-4500-8554-080854F2AC97;TokenCacheStorePath=c:\MyTokenCache;LoginPrompt=Auto"/>
</connectionStrings>  
```  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you add any sensitive information to the `app.config` or `web.config file`, for example an account password, be sure to take appropriate security precautions to protect the information.  
  
 After creating the connection string, you use it to create a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> object.  
  
```csharp  
//Use the connection string named "MyCDSServer"  
//from the configuration file  
CrmServiceClient svc = new CrmServiceClient(ConnectionString);  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Youâ€™ll have to use the following `using` directive in your code to reference the `System.Configuration` namespace to access the connection string in your code: `using System.Configuration;`  
  
 After creating a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> object, you can use the object to perform actions in Common Data Service. More information: [Use XRM Tooling to execute actions in Common Data Service](use-xrm-tooling-execute-actions.md)

## Connection string parameters

 The connection string contains a series of name=value pair separated by semi colons. The following table lists supported parameters, which can be entered in any order.  
  
|Parameter name|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`ServiceUri`, `Service Uri`, `Url`, or `Server`|Specifies the URL to the Common Data Service environment. The URL can use http or https protocol, and the port is optional. The default port is 80 for the http protocol and 443 for the https protocol. The server URL is typically in the format `https://`*`<organization-name>`*`.crm.dynamics.com`<br /><br /> The organization-name is required.|   
|`UserName`, `User Name`, `UserId`, or `User Id`|Specifies the user's identification name associated with the credentials.|  
|`Password`|Specifies the password for the user name associated with the credentials.|  
|`HomeRealmUri` or `Home Realm Uri`|Specifies the Home Realm Uri.|  
|`AuthenticationType` or `AuthType`|Specifies the authentication type to connect to Common Data Service environment. Valid values are: `AD`, `IFD` (AD FS enabled), `OAuth`, `Certificate`, `ClientSecret`, or `Office365`. However,  only `OAuth`, `Certificate`, `ClientSecret` and `Office365` are permitted values for Common Data Service environments.|  
|`RequireNewInstance`|Specifies whether to reuse an existing connection if recalled while the connection is still active. Default value is `false` that indicates the existing connection be reused. If set to `true`, will force the system to create a unique connection.|  
|`ClientId`, `AppId` or `ApplicationId`|Specifies the `ClientID` assigned when you registered your application in Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).<br /><br /> This parameter is applicable only when the authentication type is specified as `OAuth`.|
|`ClientSecret` or `Secret` |Required when Auth Type is set to `ClientSecret`. Client Secret string to use for authentication.|
|`RedirectUri` or `ReplyUrl`|Specifies the redirect URI of the application you registered in Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).<br /><br /> This parameter is applicable only when the authentication type is specified as `OAuth`.|  
|`TokenCacheStorePath`|Specifies the full path to the location where the user token cache should be stored. The running process should have access to the specified path. It is the processes responsibility to set and configure this path.<br /><br /> This parameter is applicable only when the authentication type is specified as `OAuth`.|  
|`LoginPrompt`|Specifies whether the user is prompted for credentials if the credentials are not supplied. Valid values are:<br /><br /> -   `Always`: Always prompts the user to specify credentials.<br />-   `Auto`: Allows the user to select in the login control interface whether to display the prompt or not.<br />-   `Never`: Does not prompt the user to specify credentials. If using a connection method does not have a user interface, you should use this value.<br /><br /> This parameter is applicable only when the authentication type is specified as `OAuth`.|  
|`StoreName` or `CertificateStoreName`|Specifies the store name where the certificate identified by thumbprint can be found. When set, Thumbprint is required.|
|`Thumbprint` or `CertThumbprint`| Specifies the thumbprint of the certificate to be utilized during an S2S connection. When set, AppID is required and UserID and Password values are ignored.|
|`SkipDiscovery`|Specifies whether to call instance discovery to determine the connection uri for a given instance. As of NuGet release Microsoft.CrmSdk.XrmTooling.CoreAssembly Version 9.0.2.7, default = true. Older versions default to false. <br/> Note: If set to true, it is important that the user provide the correct and accurate URI for the target instance.|
|`Integrated Security`|Specifies to use current windows credentials to attempt to create a token for the instances. As of NuGet release Microsoft.CrmSdk.XrmTooling.CoreAssembly Version 9.1.0.21|

> [!NOTE]
> <b>When using the `OAuth` AuthType\AuthenticationType</b><br/>
> For development and prototyping purposes we have provided the following AppId or ClientId and Redirect URI for use in OAuth Flows.<br/>
> For production use, you should create an AppId or ClientId that is specific to your tenant in the Azure Management portal.<br/>
> Sample AppId or ClientId = 51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d<br/>
> Sample RedirectUri = app://58145B91-0C36-4500-8554-080854F2AC97<br/>

## Connection string examples
 
The following examples show how you can use connection strings for connecting to online deployments and authentication scenarios. The connection string examples for on-premises and IFD deployment instances is now available in the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) documentation at: [Use connection strings in XRM tooling to connect](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/xrm-tooling/use-connection-strings-xrm-tooling-connect) 

### Named account using Office 365  
  
```xml
<add name="MyCDSServer" 
 connectionString="
  AuthType=Office365;
  Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com; 
  Password=passcode;
  Url=https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com"/>  
```  
  
### OAuth using named account in Office 365 with UX to prompt for authentication  

Create a new connection to Common Data Service using a UserID or Password via OAuth.

> [!NOTE]
> OAuth is the preferred auth type for connecting to Common Data Service when using an interactive flow.  This auth type fully supports the features of Azure Active Directory Conditional Access and Multi-Factor authentication.

```xml
<add name="MyCDSServer"
 connectionString="
  AuthType=OAuth;
  Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com;
  Password=passcode;
  Url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;
  AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d;
  RedirectUri=app://58145B91-0C36-4500-8554-080854F2AC97;
  TokenCacheStorePath=c:\MyTokenCache;
  LoginPrompt=Auto"/>  
```  

### OAuth using current logged in user with fall back UX to prompt for authentication

Create a new connection to Common Data Service using the current logged in user via OAuth.

> [!NOTE]
> OAuth is the preferred auth type for connecting to Common Data Service when using a interactive flow. This auth type fully supports the features of Azure Active Directory Conditional Access and Multi-Factor authentication.

```xml
<add name="MyCDSServer"
 connectionString="
  AuthType=OAuth;
  Username=jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com;
  Integrated Security=true;
  Url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;
  AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d;
  RedirectUri=app://58145B91-0C36-4500-8554-080854F2AC97;
  TokenCacheStorePath=c:\MyTokenCache\msal_cache.data;
  LoginPrompt=Auto"/>  
```  


### Certificate based authentication

Create a new connection to Common Data Service using a Application or Client Id and a Certificate.
```xml
<add name="MyCDSServer" 
  connectionString="
  AuthType=Certificate;
  url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;
  thumbprint={CertThumbPrintId};
  ClientId={AppId};"
  />
```

### ClientId or Client Secret based authentication

Create a new connection to Common Data Service using a Application or Client Id and a Client Secret.
```xml
<add name="MyCDSServer" 
  connectionString="
  AuthType=ClientSecret;
  url=https://contosotest.crm.dynamics.com;
  ClientId={AppId};
  ClientSecret={ClientSecret}"
  />
```

<a name="ConnectionStatus"></a>

## Determine your connection status

 To determine if the connection request was successful, check the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient.IsReady> property. If **true**, the connection is successful, and you are ready to work. Otherwise, check the values of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient.LastCrmError> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient.LastCrmException> properties for the cause of the connection failure.
