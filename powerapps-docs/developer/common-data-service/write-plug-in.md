# Write a plug-in

The process of writing, registering, and debugging a plug-in is:

1. **Create a .NET Framework Class library project in Visual Studio**
1. **Add the `Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies` NuGet package to the project**
1. **Implement the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPlugin> interface on classes that will be registered as steps.**
1. **Add your code to the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPlugin.Execute*> method required by the interface**
    1. **Get references to services you need**
    1. **Add your business logic**
1. **Sign & build the assembly**
1. Test the assembly
    1. Register the assembly in a test environment
    1. Add your registered assembly and steps to an unmanaged solution
    1. Test the behavior of the assembly
    1. Verify expected trace logs are written
    1. Debug the assembly as needed

Content in this topic discusses the steps **in bold** above and supports the following tutorials:

- [Tutorial: Write and register a plug-in](tutorial-write-plug-in.md)
- [Tutorial: Debug a plug-in](tutorial-debug-plug-in.md)
- [Tutorial: Update a plug-in](tutorial-update-plug-in.md)

## Assembly constraints

When creating assemblies keep the following constraints in mind.

### Optimize assembly development

The assembly should include multiple plug-in classes (or types), but can be no larger than 16 MB. It is recommended to consolidate plug-ins and workflow assemblies into a single assembly as long as the size remains below 16 MB. More information: [Optimize assembly development](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/guidance/server/optimize-assembly-development)

### Assemblies must be signed

All assemblies must be signed before they can be registered. This can be done using Visual Studio Signing tab on the project or by using [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](/dotnet/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool).

### Do not depend on .NET assemblies that interact with low-level Windows APIs

Plug-in assemblies must contain all the necessary logic within the respective dll.  Plugins may reference some core .Net assemblies. However, we do not support dependencies on .Net assemblies that interact with low-level Windows APIs, such as the graphics design interface.

## IPlugin interface

A plug-in is a class within an assembly created using a .NET Framework Class library project using .NET Framework 4.5.2 in Visual Studio. Each class in the project that will be registered as a step must implement the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPlugin> interface which requires the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPlugin.Execute*> method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When implementing `IPlugin`, the class should be *stateless*. This is because the platform caches a class instance and re-uses it for performance reasons. A simple way of thinking about this is that you shouldn't add any properties or methods to the class and everything should be included within the `Execute` method. There are some exceptions to this. For example you can have a property that represents a constant and you can have methods that represent functions that are called from the `Execute` method. The important thing is that you never store any service instance or context data as a property in your class. These change with every invocation and you don't want that data to be cached and applied to subsequent invocations.  More information: [Develop IPlugin implementations as stateless](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/guidance/server/develop-iplugin-implementations-stateless)

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPlugin.Execute*> method accepts a single <xref:System.IServiceProvider> parameter. The `IServiceProvider` has a single method:  <xref:System.IServiceProvider.GetService*>. You will use this method to get several different types of services that you can use in your code. More information: [Services you can use in your code](#services-you-can-use-in-your-code)

## Pass configuration data to your plug-in

When you register a plug-in you have the ability to pass configuration data to it. Configuration data allows you to define how a specific instance of a registered plug-in should behave. This information is passed as string data to parameters in the constructor of your class. There are two parameters: `unsecure` and `secure`.
Use the first `unsecure` parameter for data that you don't mind if people can see. Use the second `secure` parameter for sensitive data. 

The following code shows the three possible signatures for a plug-in class named `SamplePlugin`.

```csharp
public SamplePlugin()  
public SamplePlugin(string unsecure)  
public SamplePlugin(string unsecure, string secure)
```
The secure configuration data is stored in a separate entity which only system administrators have privileges to read. More information: [Set configuration data](register-plug-in.md#set-configuration-data)

## Services you can use in your code

Within your plug-in you will need to:
 
- Access the contextual information about what is happening in the event your plug-in was registered to handle. This is called the *execution context*.
- Access the Organization web service so you can write code to query data, work with entity records, use messages to perform operations.
- Write messages to the Tracing service so you can evaluate how your code is executing.

The <xref:System.IServiceProvider>.<xref:System.IServiceProvider.GetService*> method provides you with a way to access these services as needed. To get an instance of the service you invoke the `GetService` method passing the type of service.

> [!NOTE]
> When you write a plug-in that uses Azure Service Bus integration, you will use a notification service that implements the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IServiceEndpointNotificationService> interface, but this will not be described here. More information: [Azure Integration](azure-integration.md)

## Execution Context

You can get a variable that implements the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext> interface using the following code:

```csharp
// Obtain the execution context from the service provider.  
IPluginExecutionContext context = (IPluginExecutionContext)
    serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IPluginExecutionContext));
```

This <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext> provides some information about the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext.Stage> that the plugin is registered for as well as information about the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext.ParentContext> which provides information about any operation within another plug-in that triggered the current operation.

But the rest of the information available is provided by the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext> interface that this class implements. All the properties of this class provide useful information you may need to access in your code, but two of the most important are the 
<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.InputParameters> and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.OutputParameters> properties. 

Other frequently used properties are <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.SharedVariables>, <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.PreEntityImages>, and <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.PostEntityImages>.

> [!TIP]
> A good way to visualize the data that is passed into the execution context is to install the plug-in profiler solution that is available as part of the plug-in registration tool. The profiler will capture the context information as well as information that allows for replaying event locally so you can debug. Within the plugin registration tool, you can download an xml document with all the data from the event that triggered the workflow. More information: [View Plug-in Profile data](debug-plug-in.md#view-plug-in-profile-data)

### Work with ParameterCollections

All the properties of the execution context are read-only. But the `InputParameters`, `OutputParameters`, and `SharedVariables` are <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ParameterCollection> values. You can manipulate the values of the items in these collections to change the behavior of the operation, depending on the stage in the event execution pipeline your plug-in is registered for.

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ParameterCollection> values are defined as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.KeyValuePair%602> structures. In order to access a property you will need to know the name of the property that is exposed by the message. For example, to access the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Entity> property that is passed as part of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateRequest>, you need to know that the name of that property is `Target`. Then you can access this value using code like this:

```csharp
var entity = (Entity)context.InputParameters["Target"];
```
Use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages> and <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages> documentation to learn the names of the messages defined in the SDK assemblies. For custom actions, refer to the names of the parameters defined in the system.

### InputParameters

The `InputParameters` represent the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationRequest.Parameters> property that represents the operation coming in from the web services.

As described in [Use messages with the Organization service](org-service/use-messages.md), all operations that occur in the system are ultimately instances of the `OrganizationRequest` class being processed by the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*> method.

As described in [Event Framework](event-framework.md), operations go through a series of stages and you can register your plug-in on stages that occur before the data is written to the database. Within the **PreValidation** and **PreOperation** stages, you can read and change the values of the `InputParameters` so that you can control the expected outcome of the data operation.

If you find that the values in the `InputParameters` collection represent a condition that you cannot allow, you can throw an <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.InvalidPluginExecutionException> (preferably in the **PreValidation** stage) that will cancel the operation and display an error to the user with a synchronous plug-in, or log the error if the plug-in is asynchronous. More information: [Cancelling an operation](#cancelling-an-operation)

### OutputParameters

The `OutputParameters` represent the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OrganizationResponse.Results> property that represents the return value of the operation. The `OutputParameters` are not populated until after the database transaction, so they are only available for plug-ins registered in the **PostOperation** stage. If you want to change the values returned by the operation, you can modify them within the `OutputParameters`.

### Shared variables

The <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.SharedVariables> property allows for including data that can be passed from a plug-in to a step that occurs later in the execution pipeline. Because this is a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ParameterCollection> value, plug-ins can add, read, or modify properties to share data with subsequent steps.

The following example shows how a `PrimaryContact` value can be passed from a plug-in registered for a **PreOperation** step to a **PostOperation** step.

```csharp
public class PreOperation : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        // Obtain the execution context from the service provider.
        Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext context = (Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext)
            serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext));

        // Create or retrieve some data that will be needed by the post event
        // plug-in. You could run a query, create an entity, or perform a calculation.
        //In this sample, the data to be passed to the post plug-in is
        // represented by a GUID.
        Guid contact = new Guid("{74882D5C-381A-4863-A5B9-B8604615C2D0}");

        // Pass the data to the post event plug-in in an execution context shared
        // variable named PrimaryContact.
        context.SharedVariables.Add("PrimaryContact", (Object)contact.ToString());
    }
}

public class PostOperation : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        // Obtain the execution context from the service provider.
        Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext context = (Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext)
            serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IPluginExecutionContext));

        // Obtain the contact from the execution context shared variables.
        if (context.SharedVariables.Contains("PrimaryContact"))
        {
            Guid contact =
                new Guid((string)context.SharedVariables["PrimaryContact"]);

            // Do something with the contact.
        }
    }
}
```


### Entity Images

When you register a step for a plug-in that includes an entity as one of the parameters, you have the option to specify that a copy of the entity data be included as *snapshot* or image using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.PreEntityImages> and/or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.PostEntityImages> properties.

This data provides a comparison point for entity data as it flows through the event pipeline. Using these images provides much better performance than including code in a plug-in to retrieve an entity just to compare the attribute values.

When you define an entity image, you specify an entity alias value you can use to access the specific image. For example, if you define a pre entity image with the alias '`a`', you can use the following code to access the `name` attribute value.

```csharp
var oldAccountName = (string)context.PreEntityImages["a"]["name"];
```

More information: [Define entity images](register-plug-in.md#define-entity-images)

## Organization Service

To work with data within a plug-in you use the organization service. Do not try to use the Web API. Plug-ins are optimized to use the .NET SDK assemblies.

To gain access to a `svc` variable that implements the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface, use the following code:


```csharp
// Obtain the organization service reference which you will need for  
// web service calls.  
IOrganizationServiceFactory serviceFactory =
    (IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
IOrganizationService svc = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);
```
The `context.UserId` variable used with <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(System.Nullable{System.Guid})> comes from execution context the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.UserId> property, so this is call is done after the execution context has been accessed.

More information:
 - [Entity Operations](org-service/entity-operations.md)
 - [Query data](org-service/entity-operations-query-data.md)
 - [Create entities](org-service/entity-operations-create.md)
 - [Retrieve an entity](org-service/entity-operations-retrieve.md)
 - [Update and Delete entities](org-service/entity-operations-update-delete.md)
 - [Associate and disassociate entities](org-service/entity-operations-associate-disassociate.md)
 - [Use messages](org-service/use-messages.md)
 - [Late-bound and Early-bound programming](org-service/early-bound-programming.md)

You can use early bound types within a plug-in. Just include the generated types file in your project. But you should be aware that all entity types that are provided by the execution context input parameters will be late-bound types. You will need to convert them to early bound types. For example you can do the following when you know the `Target` parameter represents an account entity.

```csharp
Account acct = context.InputParameters["Target"].ToEntity<Account>();
``` 
But you should never try to set the value using an early bound type. Don't try to do this:

```csharp
context.InputParameters["Target"] = new Account() { Name = "MyAccount" }; // WRONG: Do not do this. 
```
This will cause an <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException> to occur.

## Impersonation

Sometimes you need the code in a plug-in to run in the context of a different user.

There are two ways to apply impersonation in plug-ins: at registration or execution.

### At plug-in registration

When you register a plug-in step you can specify a user account to use when the code is run by choosing from the **Run in User's Context** option. By default this is set to use the **Calling User**, which is the user account which initiated the action. When this default option is applied, the [SdkMessageProcessingStep.ImpersonatingUserId](reference/entities/sdkmessageprocessingstep.md#BKMK_ImpersonatingUserId) will be set to null or <xref:System.Guid.Empty>.

More information: [Register plug-in step](register-plug-in.md#register-plug-in-step)

### During plug-in execution

You can override the setting specified at registration at run time by setting the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationServiceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(System.Nullable{System.Guid})> `userId` parameter.

This is typically set to the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.UserId> value which will apply the user account defined by the plug-in step registration.

```csharp
(IOrganizationServiceFactory)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IOrganizationServiceFactory));
    IOrganizationService service = serviceFactory.CreateOrganizationService(context.UserId);
```

If you want to override the step registration you can pass the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.InitiatingUserId> to have a service that will use the user account that initiated the action that caused the plug-in to run.

You can also provide the [SystemUser.SystemUserId](reference/entities/systemuser.md#BKMK_SystemUserId) from any valid user account. This will work as long as that user has the permissions to perform the operations in the plug-in.

## Use the tracing service

Use the tracing service to write messages to the [PluginTraceLog Entity](reference/entities/plugintracelog.md) so that you can review the logs to understand what occurred when the plug-in ran.

To write to the tracelog, you need to get an instance of the tracing service. The following code shows how to get an instance of the tracing service using the <xref:System.IServiceProvider>.<xref:System.IServiceProvider.GetService*> method.


```csharp
// Obtain the tracing service
ITracingService tracingService =
(ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));
```

To write to the trace, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ITracingService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.ITracingService.Trace*> method.

```csharp
tracingService.Trace("Write {0} {1}.", "your", "message");
```

More information: [Use Tracing](debug-plug-in.md#use-tracing).



## Cancelling an operation

Your code can cause an operation to be cancelled by throwing an exception. Any unhandled exception will cause the operation to be cancelled so it is important that you apply coding practices to manage any exceptions that are thrown and decide whether to allow it to cancel the operation or not.

If your business logic dictates that the operation should be cancelled, you should throw an <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.InvalidPluginExecutionException> exception and provide a message to explain why the operation was cancelled.

When you throw an <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.InvalidPluginExecutionException> exception within a synchronous plug-in an error dialog with your message will be displayed to the user. If you don't provide a message, a generic error dialog will be shown to the user. If any other type of exception is thrown, the user will see an error dialog with a generic message and the exception message and stack trace will be written to the [PluginTraceLog Entity](reference/entities/plugintracelog.md)

Ideally, you should only cancel operations using synchronous plug-ins registered in the **PreValidation** stage. This stage *usually* occurs outside the main database transaction. Cancelling an operation before it reaches the transaction is highly desireable because the cancelled operation has to be rolled back. Rolling back the operation requires significant resources and has a performance impact on the system. Operations in the **PreOperation** and **PostOperation** stages are always within the database transaction.

Sometimes **PreValidation** stages will be within a transaction when they are initated by logic in another operation. For example, if you create a task entity record in the **PreOperation** stage of the creation of an account, the task creation will pass through the event execution pipeline and occur within the **PreValidation** stage yet it will be part of the transaction that is creating the account entity record. You can tell whether an operation is within a transaction by the value of the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.IsInTransaction> property.

## Performance considerations

When you add the business logic for your plug-in you need to be very aware of the impact they will have on overall performance. The business logic in plug-ins should take no more than 2 seconds to complete.

### Time and resource constraints

There is a 2-minute time limit for message operations to complete. There are also limitations on the amount of CPU and memory resources that can be used by extensions. If the limits are exceeded an exception is thrown and the operation will be cancelled.

If the time limit is exceeded, an <xref:System.TimeoutException> will be thrown. If any custom extension exceeds threshold CPU, memory, or handle limits or is otherwise unresponsive, that process will be killed by the platform. At that point any current extension in that process will fail with exceptions. However, the next time that the extension is executed it will run normally.

### Monitor Performance

Run-time information about plug-ins and custom workflow extensions is captured and store in the [PluginTypeStatistic Entity](reference/entities/plugintypestatistic.md). These records are populated within 30 minutes to one hour after the custom code executes. This entity provides the following data points:

|**Attribute**|**Description**|
|--|--|
|AverageExecuteTimeInMilliseconds|The average execution time (in milliseconds) for the plug-in type. |
|CrashContributionPercent|The plug-in type percentage contribution to crashes. |
|CrashCount|Number of times the plug-in type has crashed. |
|CrashPercent|Percentage of crashes for the plug-in type. |
|ExecuteCount|Number of times the plug-in type has been executed. |
|FailureCount |Number of times the plug-in type has failed. |
|FailurePercent|Percentage of failures for the plug-in type. |
|PluginTypeIdName|Unique identifier of the user who last modified the plug-in type statistic. |
|TerminateCpuContributionPercent |The plug-in type percentage contribution to Worker process termination due to excessive CPU usage. |
|TerminateHandlesContributionPercent |The plug-in type percentage contribution to Worker process termination due to excessive handle usage. |
|TerminateMemoryContributionPercent|The plug-in type percentage contribution to Worker process termination due to excessive memory usage. |
|TerminateOtherContributionPercent|The plug-in type percentage contribution to Worker process termination due to unknown reasons. |

This data is also available for you to browse using the [Organization Insights Plug-ins dashboard](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/use-organization-insights-solution-view-instance-metrics#plug-ins), along with many other useful reports.
