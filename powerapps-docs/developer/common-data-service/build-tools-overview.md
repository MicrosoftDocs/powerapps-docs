## What are PowerApps build tools?

The PowerApps build tools are a collection of PowerApps specific Azure DevOps build tasks that eliminate the need to manually download custom tooling  and scripts to manage the application lifecycle of PowerApps. The tasks can be used individually to perform a simple task, such as importing a solution into a downstream environment, or used together in a pipeline to orchestrate a scenario, such as ‘Generate Build Artifact,’ ‘Deploy to Test,’ or ‘Harvest Maker Changes.’ The build tasks can largely be categorized into four types:

- Helper 
- Quality check 
- Solution 
- Environment management 

## Get the PowerApps build tools 
The PowerApps build tools can be installed into your Azure DevOps organization from the [Azure Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerApps-BuildTools).
