# Image attributes

Entity records that include image data provide a unique experience within the application. As a developer you need to understand how you work with image data.  
  
 Only certain system entities and custom entities support images. For information about which system entities support images, see [Entity images](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/introduction-entities#entity-images).  
  
<a name="BKMK_SupportingAttributes"></a>   
## Supporting attributes  
 For those entities which support image attributes, the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.AttributeMetadata.SchemaName> of the entity image attribute is always `EntityImage`. When an image attribute is added to an entity some additional attributes are created to support it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Clients that do not use the current .NET assemblies need to include <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy.SdkClientVersion> with a value of ‘6.0.0.0’ or higher in order to receive <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.ImageAttributeMetadata> attributes. More information: <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy.SdkClientVersion>.  
  
### EntityImage_Timestamp attribute  
 Attribute Type Name:  `BigIntType`  
  
 The value represents when the image was last updated and is used to help make sure that the latest version of the image is downloaded and cached on the client.  
  
### EntityImage_URL attribute  
 Attribute Type Name: `StringType`  
  
 An absolute URL to display the entity image in a client.  
  
 The URL is composed this way:  
  
```http  
{0}/image/download.aspx?entity={1}&attribute={2}&id={3}&timestamp={4}
```  
  
- 0 : The organization URL  
  
- 1 : The entity logical name  
  
- 2 : The attribute logical name  
  
- 3 : The EntityImageId value.  
  
- 4 : The EntityImage_Timestamp value  
  
  For example:   
  `https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com/image/download.aspx?attribute=entityimage&entity=contact&id={ECB6D3DF-4A04-E311-AFE0-00155D9C3020}&timestamp=635120312218444444`  
  
### EntityImageId  
 Attribute Type Name: `UniqueIdentifierType`  
  
 The unique identifier of the image  
  
<a name="BKMK_RetrievingImages"></a>   
## Retrieving image data  
 When you use <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple*> or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Retrieve*> the `EntityImage` is not included when the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Query.ColumnSet>.`AllColumns` property is set to true. Because of the potential size of data in this attribute, to return this attribute you must explicitly request it.  
  
 The binary data representing the image isn’t returned using the deprecated <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.ExecuteFetchRequest> class. You should use <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.RetrieveMultipleRequest> instead.  
  
 More information: [Sample: Set and retrieve entity images](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/sample-set-retrieve-entity-images).  
  
<a name="BKMK_UploadingImages"></a>   
## Uploading image data  
 To update images set the value of the `EntityImage` to a `byte[]` that contains the content of the file. All images are displayed in a 144x144 pixel square. Images will be cropped and resized to reduce the size of the data before being saved.  
  
- Images with at least one side larger than 144 pixels are cropped on center to 144x144.  
  
- Images with both sides smaller than 144 are cropped square to their smallest side.  
  
  The following table shows two examples.  
  
|Before|After|
