# Apply business logic using code

Whenever possible, you should first consider applying one of the several declarative process options to define or apply business logic. More information: [Apply business logic in CDS for Apps](../../maker/common-data-service/cds-processes.md)

When a declarative process doesnâ€™t meet a requirement, as a developer you have several options. This topic will introduce common options to write code.

## Create a plug-in

You can write a .NET assembly to plug-in to the data transaction to apply business logic on the server. With Common Data Service for Apps there is a framework you use to register specific events to execute code defined within a class in an assembly. 

More information: [Write plug-ins to extend business processes](plug-ins.md)

## Create a workflow extension

You can write a .NET assembly to provide new options within the process designer. This method provides a new option for people using the workflow designer to apply a condition or perform a new action. A workflow extension can then be re-used by people who are not developers to apply the logic in your code.
