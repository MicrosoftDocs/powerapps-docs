# Discovery Services

[!INCLUDE [cc-discovery-service-description](includes/cc-discovery-service-description.md)]


A Discovery service is accessed through the Web API.

- For the Web API: [Discover the URL for your organization using the Web API](webapi/discover-url-organization-web-api.md)
- For the Organization Service: [Use the Discovery Service with the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery NameSpace](org-service/discovery-service.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy Discovery service that was accessible via the Organization Service SDK has been deprecated along with the regional Discovery Web API endpoints. See [Important changes (deprecations)](/power-platform/important-changes-coming.md) for more details.
