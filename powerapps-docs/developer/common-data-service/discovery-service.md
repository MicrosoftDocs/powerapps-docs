[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cc-discovery-service-description](includes/cc-discovery-service-description.md)]

The Discovery Service is accessed through two different APIs:

- For the OData V4 RESTful API: [Discover the URL for your organization](webapi/discover-url-organization-web-api.md)
- For the discovery API available through the 2011 (SOAP) endpoint: [Use the Discovery Service with the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery NameSpace](org-service/discovery-service.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The *regional* Discovery Service is deprecated. More information: [Important changes (deprecations)](/power-platform/important-changes-coming.md).
