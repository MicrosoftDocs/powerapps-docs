# Access external web resources

Plug-ins and custom workflow activities executing in the sandbox can access the network through the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. This capability provides support for accessing popular web resources like social sites, news feeds, web services, and more. The following web access restrictions apply to this sandbox capability.  
  
- Only the HTTP and HTTPS protocols are allowed.
- Access to localhost (loopback) is not permitted.
- IP addresses cannot be used. You must use a named web address that requires DNS name resolution.
- Anonymous authentication is supported and recommended. There is no provision for prompting the logged on user for credentials or saving those credentials.

Other methods of accessing web resources include the use of webhooks and the [!INCLUDE [pn_azure_service_bus](../../includes/pn_azure_service_bus.md)]. Refer to the links provided below for more information on those topics.
