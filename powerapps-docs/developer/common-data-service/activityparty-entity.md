## Activity Party Types  

 There are 11 activity party types in Common Data Service. The activity party type is stored as an integer value in the `ActivityParty.ParticipationTypeMask` attribute. The following table lists the different activity party types, the corresponding integer value for the `ActivityParty.ParticipationTypeMask` attribute, and the description.

## Activity Party Types available for each activity  
 Not all activity party types are available for each activity in Common Data Service, except for a custom activity. A custom activity supports all activity party types. You can associate an activity party type for an activity by using the respective attribute of an activity. For example, to associate an `Organizer` activity party type with an appointment activity, you must specify a value or an array of values of the `ActivityParty` type in the `Appointment.Organizer` attribute.  
  
 To control which email address should be used for sending emails to the activity party, or for replying to emails from the activity party, set the `ActivityParty.AddressUsed` attribute.  
  
 The following table lists the activity party types that are supported for each activity, and the corresponding activity properties to specify those activity party types.  
  
|Activity entity name|Supported activity party type|Activity attribute|  
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|  
|Appointment|OptionalAttendee<br />Organizer<br />RequiredAttendee|Appointment.OptionalAttendees<br />Appointment.Organizer<br />Appointment.RequiredAttendees|
