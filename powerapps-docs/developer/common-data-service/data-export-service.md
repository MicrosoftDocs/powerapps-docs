# Data export service

Data Export is an add-on service made available as a Common Data Service solution that adds the ability to replicate Common Data Service data to a Microsoft Azure SQL Database store in a customer-owned Microsoft Azure subscription. The supported target destinations are Microsoft Azure SQL Database and Microsoft Azure SQL Server on Microsoft Azure virtual machines. Data Export intelligently synchronizes the entire Common Data Service schema and data initially and thereafter synchronizes on a continuous basis as changes occur (delta changes) in Common Data Service.  
  
The Data Export service provides an interface for managing configuration and ongoing administration of this service from within Common Data Service.  For more information, see [Replicate data to Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/replicate-data-microsoft-azure-sql-database). This topic explains the corresponding programmatic interface and issues for this service.  
  
## Prerequisites for using the Data Export Service  
 Because this service requires access to an external Microsoft Azure SQL Database from Common Data Service, a number of prerequisites must be satisfied before you can successfully access this service. The following perquisites are more fully explained from an administrator's perspective in the section [Prerequisites for using Data Export Service](/power-platform/admin/replicate-data-microsoft-azure-sql-database#prerequisites-for-using-).  
  
 Your Common Data Service environment must be configured so that:  
  
- The entities that will be exported are enabled with change tracking. For more information, see [Use change tracking to synchronize data with external systems](use-change-tracking-synchronize-data-external-systems.md).  
  
- Code is run in the context of a user with the System Administrator security role.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Note that programmatic access to this service does *not* require the installation of the associated Data Export managed solution.  
  
 The target Azure SQL Database must be configured so that:  
  
- The subscription must support the volume of data being replicated from your Common Data Service instance.  
  
- Firewall settings must allow access from the IP address of your  Data Export service. For more information, see [Configure an Azure SQL Database server-level firewall rule using the Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-configure-firewall-settings/).  
  
- It is recommended that option “Allow access to azure services” be enabled.  
  
- The database user, specified in the  data export connection string, must have the proper create and alter permissions on the target database.  At minimum these include: `CRTB`, `CRTY`, `CRVW`,     `CRPR`, and `ALUS`. For more information, see [Permissions (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx).  
  
- At least one user have extensive permissions on the schema. The following script creates such a new user.  
  
```sql  
  
USE MASTER;  
CREATE LOGIN NewUser WITH PASSWORD='newpassword';  
  
USE DESTINATIONDATABASE;  
CREATE USER NewUser FOR LOGIN NewUser  
GRANT CREATE TABLE, CREATE TYPE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE PROCEDURE, ALTER ANY USER to NewUser  
GRANT ALTER, REFERENCES, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT, EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::dbo TO NewUser  
  
```  
  
For online solutions and services, Azure provides a [Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) service to safeguard cryptographic keys, passwords, and other secrets.  To use Azure Key Vault, this customer-owned service must be configured so that permission is granted to "Dynamics 365 Data Export Service", which is used to safely store the SQL Azure connection string. To perform this configuration with a PowerShell script, see [How to set up Azure Key Vault](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt744592.aspx). Alternately, this service can be managed through its REST API; see [Key Vault management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt620024.aspx).  
  
It is also advised that you add the domain https://discovery.crmreplication.azure.net/ to the trusted sites list in your browser and to enable pop-ups for this site.  
  
## Programming for the Data Export Service  
 The Data Export Service exposes a REST-based API that is divided into two groups: a set of `Metadata` operations for exploring Common Data Service organizational structure, relationships, and connection information; and a set of `Profiles` operations    for configuring and managing each data replication.  This API is fully defined and documented at the following [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) URLs:

### Gain Access  
Because only Common Data Service System Administrators are authorized to perform data export operations, these APIs enforce caller authorization through the use of Azure Active Directory ([AAD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/)) [security tokens](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-token-and-claims/). The following code snippet demonstrates generating such a token for a web application by using the administrator's name and password.   You must replace the `AppId`, `crmAdminUser` and `crmAdminPassword` with values appropriate to your service. This approach can be used for development and testing, but more secure means should be used for production, such as the use of Azure Key Vault.  
  
```csharp  
  
//Reference Azure AD authentication Library (ADAL v2.29)    
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;  
   . . .  
    string yourAppClientID = "[app-associated-GUID]";   //Your AAD-registered AppId   
    string crmAdminUser = "admin1@contoso.com";  //Your CRM administrator user name  
    string crmAdminPassword = "Admin1Password";  //Your CRM administrator password;   
    //For interactive applications, there are overloads of AcquireTokenAsync() which prompt for password.   
    var authParam = AuthenticationParameters.CreateFromResourceUrlAsync(new   
        Uri("https://discovery.crmreplication.azure.net/crm/exporter/aad/challenge")).Result;  
    AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authParam.Authority, false);  
    string token = authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(authParam.Resource, yourAppClientID,   
        new UserCredential(crmAdminUser, crmAdminPassword)).Result.AccessToken;  
  
```  
  
For instructions on how to obtain a `AppId` see [Authorize access to web applications using OAuth 2.0 and Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code/). For more information about Azure user security, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/).  
  
### Error handling and failure processing  
 Once a profile is correctly configured, the synchronization process is typically highly reliable. However, if a record fails to synchronize, the following failure processing is applied:  
  
1. After the configured retry interval, another attempt is made to synchronize the record. This is repeated up to the configured maximum number of retries.  
  
2. The record is marked as processed.  
  
3. A corresponding failed record entry is written to the error log.  
  
4. The next record is processed.  
  
Because the record is marked as processed, no future attempt is made to synchronize the record until its value or schema changes. (Note that writing identical values back into an entity instance also marks it as modified.)  
  
The entries in the error log are write-only. Future successes or failures during synchronization of the same record do not result in the alteration of past entries for this record. For example, a failure entry will remain in the error log even after the record has been successfully synchronized during some later synchronization cycle.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  This error processing logic is subject to change in future releases of this service.  
  
These failure entries can be retrieved through the [Get the failure details for a given Profile](https://discovery.crmreplication.azure.net/swagger/ui/index) request. The response returns a URI to an Azure blob that contains the failure information.  Each line has the following comma-separated fields (newlines added for clarity):  
  
```  
  
Entity: <entity-name>,   
RecordId: <”N/A” | guid>,   
NotificationTime: <datetime>,   
ChangeType: <sync-type>,  
FailureReason: <description>  
  
```  
  
For example:  
  
```  
  
Entity: lead,   
RecordId: N/A, NotificationTime: , ChangeType: Trigger Initial Export, FailureReason: There is already an object named 'hatest201_lead' in the database.  
Entity: account, RecordId: b2a19cdd-88df-e311-b8e5-6c3be5a8b200, NotificationTime: 8/31/2016 6:50:38 PM, ChangeType: New, FailureReason: Invalid object name 'dbo.hatest201_account'.  
```
