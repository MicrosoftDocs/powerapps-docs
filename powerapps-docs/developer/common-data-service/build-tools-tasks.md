# Build tools tasks

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Several types of build tasks are available as part of the PowerApps build tools to help automate your application lifecycle, using Azure DevOps.
  
## Helper task

The PowerApps tools installer is required to be the first task in any build and release pipeline. This task installs a set of PowerApps specific tools required by the agent to run the PowerApps build tasks. This task does not require any additional configuration.

## Quality check

The PowerApps checker task runs a static analysis check on your solution(s) against a set of best-practice rules to identify any problematic patterns that you might inadvertently have introduced when building your solution.

| **Parameters** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| PowerApps checker service  |   Select the service endpoint for PowerApps checker. The service   endpoint is defined under **Service Connections** in **Project Settings**.  **NOTE:** The service connection type that must be used for this specific task only is ‘PowerApps Checker,’ which is a service principals connection. More information on how to configure Service Principals before you can use the  task is available [here](https://aka.ms/buildtoolsconnection).  |
| Location of file to analyze  | Specify whether to reference a local file or a reference file from a Sas url. 
| Local files to analyze/Sas uri for file to analyze |  Specify the path and file name of the zip files to analyze.   Wildcards can be used. For example, **\*.zip   for all zip files in all sub folders. You can choose to specify the files   directly or reference a File from a Sas uri.   |
|  Rule set |   Specify which ruleset to apply. The following two rulesets are available:  **Solution Checker:** This is the same ruleset that is run from the [Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com/).    **AppSource:** This is the extended ruleset that is used to certify an application before it can be published to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/).   |

## Solution tasks

This set of tasks perform actions against solutions, and includes the following tasks:

### PowerApps import solution

The import solution imports a solution into a target environment.

| **Parameters** | **Description** |
|----|----|
| PowerApps environment URL  | The service endpoint for the target environment that you want to import the solution to. For example, *https://powerappsbuildtools.crm.dynamics.com*.  Service endpoints can be defined under **Service Connections** in **Project Settings**. |
| Solution input file  | The path and file name of the solution.zip file to import into the target environment. For example: *$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\$(SolutionName).zip*.
 |
> [!NOTE] 
> Variables give you a convenient way to get key bits of data into various parts of your pipeline. A comprehensive list of predefined variables is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml).

### PowerApps export solution

The export solution task exports a solution from a source environment.
