# Build tools tasks

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Several types of build tasks are available as part of the Power Apps build tools to help automate your application lifecycle, using Azure DevOps.
  
## Helper task

The Power Apps tools installer is required to be the first task in any build and release pipeline. This task installs a set of Power Apps specific tools required by the agent to run the Power Apps build tasks. This task does not require any additional configuration.

## Quality check

The Power Apps checker task runs a static analysis check on your solution(s) against a set of best-practice rules to identify any problematic patterns that you might inadvertently have introduced when building your solution.

| **Parameters** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Power Apps checker service  |   Select the service endpoint for Power Apps checker. The service   endpoint is defined under **Service Connections** in **Project Settings**.  **NOTE:** The service connection type that must be used for this specific task only is ‘Power Apps Checker,’ which is a service principals connection. More information on how to configure Service Principals before you can use the  task is available [here](#configure-service-connection-for-power-apps-checker).  |
| Location of file to analyze  | Specify whether to reference a local file or a reference file from a Sas url. 
| Local files to analyze/Sas uri for file to analyze |  Specify the path and file name of the zip files to analyze.   Wildcards can be used. For example, **\*.zip   for all zip files in all sub folders. You can choose to specify the files   directly or reference a File from a Sas uri.   |
|  Rule set |   Specify which ruleset to apply. The following two rulesets are available:  **Solution Checker:** This is the same ruleset that is run from the [Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com/).    **AppSource:** This is the extended ruleset that is used to certify an application before it can be published to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).   |

### Configure service connection for Power Apps checker

Before you can configure the Power Apps Checker task, you first need to define the service principals used to connect to the Power Apps checker service. More information about the underlying Power Apps checker service and authentication is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/powerapps/overview?view=pa-ps-latest#get-started-using-the-microsoftpowerappscheckerpowershell-module), however, the steps outlined below cover everything you need to get started.

The following outlines how to generate the required Azure Active Directory (AAD) application using the [AzureAD PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0), add a client secret and then use that to configure the Power Apps checker connection string.

> [!NOTE]
> Privileges to create service principals in an AAD tenant licensed for Power Apps (P1/P2) or D365 CE are required to complete these steps. 

1. Open a PowerShell command with admin rights.
![Powershell command window](media/pscommand.png "Powershell command window")
2. Run the following command in PowerShell: *Install-Module -Name AzureAD*.
![Install-Module command](media/pscommand-install.png "Install-Module command screen")
 
3.	This prompts you to trust the modules from PSGallery. Select **A (Yes to all)**.
1. Copy and paste the following into the PowerShell prompt:

```powershell 
function New-PowerAppsCheckerAzureADApplication
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [Guid]
        $TenantId,
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string]
        $ApplicationDisplayName
    )
    # Using AzureAD as the RM modules, AzureRm.Resource and AzureRm.Profile, do not allow for setting RequiredResourceAccess
    Import-Module AzureAD | Out-Null
    try
    {
        Connect-AzureAD -TenantId $TenantId | Out-Null
    }
    catch [Microsoft.Open.Azure.AD.CommonLibrary.AadAuthenticationFailedException]
    {
        Write-Error "Received a failure result from the connecting to AzureAD, $($_.Exception.Message). Stopping."
        return
    }
    $graphSignInAndReadProfileRequirement = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
    $acc1 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d","Scope"
    $graphSignInAndReadProfileRequirement.ResourceAccess = $acc1
    $graphSignInAndReadProfileRequirement.ResourceAppId = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"

    $powerAppsCheckerApiRequirement = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.RequiredResourceAccess"
    $acc1 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "d533b86d-8f67-45f0-b8bb-c0cee8da0356","Scope"
    $acc2 = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ResourceAccess" -ArgumentList "640bd519-35de-4a25-994f-ae29551cc6d2","Scope"
    $powerAppsCheckerApiRequirement.ResourceAccess = $acc1,$acc2
    $powerAppsCheckerApiRequirement.ResourceAppId = "c9299480-c13a-49db-a7ae-cdfe54fe0313"

    $application = New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName $ApplicationDisplayName -PublicClient $true -ReplyUrls "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob" -RequiredResourceAccess $graphSignInAndReadProfileRequirement, $powerAppsCheckerApiRequirement
    if ($application -eq $null -or $application.AppId -eq $null)
    {
        Write-Error "Unable to create the application as requested."
    }
    else
    {
        Write-Host "The application $($application.AppId):$ApplicationDisplayName was created in the tenant, $TenantId. You may need to have an administrator grant consent. If running in a userless process, you will need to add a secret or certificate in which to authenticate." 
    }
    return $application
}

# Login to AAD as your user
Connect-AzureAD

# Establish your tenant ID
$tenantId = (Get-AzureADTenantDetail).ObjectId

# Create the AAD application registration using the AzureAD module and the sample script
$newApp = New-PowerAppsCheckerAzureADApplication -ApplicationDisplayName "Power Apps Checker Client" -TenantId $tenantId

# Next step => create a secret via the Admin portal, CLI, or PowerShell module.
 ```

5.	When prompted, select **A (Always run)**.
![PowerShell command screen](media/pscommand-always-run.png "PowerShell command screenshot")
6. A login dialog appears. Sign in as a user. Note that you might have to sign in twice in some cases.
7. Once the script is complete, the application ID and tenant is displayed in the command window.
8. Next, login to [Azure AD](https://portal.azure.com) to get the client secret.
9. In Microsoft Azure, select **Azure Active Directory –> App Registrations -> Power Apps Checker Client**.
![Select checker client in Azure](media/azure-select-checker.png "Azure screenshot")
10. In the left namigation pane, under **Manage**, select **Certificates & secrets**.
11. On the **Certificates & secrets** screen, under **Client secrets**, select **New client secret**. 
12. Type a description for the client secret, select expiration setting, and then click **Add**.
13. Copy the client secret value that appears on the next screen. 
![Copy client secret](media/client-secret-copy.png "Client secret screenshot")
    > [!NOTE]
    > This is the only time that the client secret is displayed
14. Open the Power Apps checker service connection and paste the client secret into the **Service Principal Key** field, and then click **OK**.

Your connection is now ready to be used by the [Power Apps Checker Build Task](https://aka.ms/buildtoolsdoc).
