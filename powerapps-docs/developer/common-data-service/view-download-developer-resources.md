## Connect your apps to this instance of Common Data Service

This section provides information you need to connect to your Common Data Service instance.

### Instance Web API

This is the URL for the Web API for your instance. The Web API is an OData v4 RESTful API. You can also download the service document that describes the metadata and operations available in your instance. More information: [Developer Documentation: Use the Common Data Service Web API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/overview)

### Organization Service

This is the URL for the SOAP endpoint for the Organization Service for your instance.
You can download the WSDL for this service here, but usually you will use the CrmSvcUtil.exe code generation tool to build entity classes for .NET projects. More information: 
- [Developer Documentation: Create early bound entity classes with the code generation tool (CrmSvcUtil.exe)](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/generate-early-bound-classes)
- [Developer Documentation: Use the Organization Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/overview)

### Instance Reference Information

This information uniquely describes your instance. There is a GUID **ID** and a **Unique Name**.
This information is needed when you use Azure extensions with your instance.
More information: [Azure integration](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/azure-integration)

## Connect your apps to the Common Data Service Discovery Service

Because people may have access to multiple Common Data Service environments, the discovery services allow for retrieving the available environments that a person can access based on their user credentials.

### Discovery Web API

This is the endpoint address for the RESTful OData v4 version of the Discovery Service to use for your instance. You can also download the service document here.
