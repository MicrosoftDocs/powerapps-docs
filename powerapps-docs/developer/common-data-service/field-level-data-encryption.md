# Field-level data encryption

<!-- 

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/field-level-data-encryption 

**This has nothing to do with Field level security!**

Is Paul the right owner?

It is mostly related to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/data-encryption
Pls refer to the PowerApps version of that topic

For Dynamics 365 (online), all new and upgraded organizations use data encryption by default. Data encryption canâ€™t be turned off.

Note that the Email Router mentioned in this topic is deprecated. Is this still relevant?
