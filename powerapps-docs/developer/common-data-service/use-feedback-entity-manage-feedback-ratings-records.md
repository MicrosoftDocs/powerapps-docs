# Use the Feedback entity to manage feedback and ratings for records

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Improve your products and services by enabling users to provide feedback and ratings for entity records in Common Data Service. For example, you can enable feedbacks and ratings for the `Product` entity to know user's feedback on the products you sell, or on the `Incident` (case) entity to understand and improve the quality of your customer support team.  
  
 You can enable feedback and rating for both system and custom entities in Common Data Service. By default, the `KnowledgeArticle` entity is enabled for feedback and ratings. Use the new `Feedback` entity to programmatically create and manage feedback for entity records.  
  
 To programmatically enable feedback for a:  
  
- System entity, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest> message to update the entity, and set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest.HasFeedback> property to true.  
  
- Custom entity, set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest.HasFeedback> property to true  while creating the entity, or update existing custom entity to set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest.HasFeedback> property to true.  
  
  Once you have enabled an entity for feedback and rating, you can't disable it. After you enable an entity for feedback, a regarding relationship is created between the entity and the `Feedback` entity.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can also use the customization tools in Common Data Service to enable feedback and rating for system and custom entities. More information: [Enable an entity for feedback](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=785436)  
  
 The `Feedback` entity stores the following information :  
  
- Feedback title  
  
- Feedback comments  
  
- Feedback rating. You can also define a range for ratings by specifying a minimum and maximum (numerical) value for ratings. For example, a rating of 4 on the scale of 1-5.  
  
- Normalized rating for feedback that is automatically calculated  to show the specified user rating scaled to a value between 0 and 1 based on the minimum and maximum rating values.  
  
  > [!NOTE]
  >  The normalized rating helps to normalize or even out the specified rating value for different rating ranges (minimum and maximum rating values). The normalized  rating is calculated as follows: (Rating - Minimum Rating) / (Maximum Rating - Minimum Rating).  
  >   
  >  Also, rating for a record is calculated as an average of all the normalized ratings for the record.  
  
- Feedback status such as Open or Closed  
  
- Feedback source to display the source from where the feedback was submitted. If the feedback was created from within Common Data Service, the value is set to **Internal**. Developers can add a value of their choice depending on the application used to provide feedback.  
  
- User who created or last modified the feedback record  
  
- Entity record that the feedback is associated with
