# Tutorial: Create workflow extension

This tutorial will show you the process to extend the workflow designer to add custom activities and logic using a workflow assembly, sometimes known as a workflow activity. The extensions you create this way can be used within a workflow, a custom action, or a dialog.

This tutorial uses a very simple example to focus on the requirements and process to:

- Create a Visual Studio Activity Library project
- Add a CodeActivity class
- Define input and output parameters
- Add your business logic
- Sign and build the assembly
- Register your assembly
- Test your assembly
- Add your assembly to a solution

## Prerequisites

- You must have Windows Workflow Foundation included as an individual component with Visual Studio 2017.  More information: [Visual Studio requirements](workflow-extensions.md#visual-studio-requirements)
- A Common Data Service instance and administrator privileges
- Understanding of how to configure workflows. More information: [Classic Common Data Service workflows](/flow/workflow-processes)
- A model-driven app that allows you to edit accounts.

## Goal

The example below will create a simple custom workflow activity that may be used in a workflow, dialog, or action process. More information: [Configure workflow stages and steps](/flow/configure-workflow-steps)

This custom workflow activity will match the following requirements:

1. Accept an decimal input parameter
1. Output a value equal to the input parameter plus 10.

In a workflow for the **Account** entity it may be used in the following manner to increment the **Credit limit** value using two steps:

![The goal for this tutorial](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-goal.png)

Step 1 uses the **Sample: Increment by 10** custom workflow activity to accept the **Account Credit Limit** value and increment it by 10.
Step 2 uses the **Update Record** action to update the **Account Credit Limit** value with the incremented value.

### Step 1: Get incremented Account Credit Limit

When the first step is added, the custom workflow activity will be available in a **Sample** group and have the name **Increment by 10**.

![The increment by 10 step](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-increment-by-10-step.png)

When configuring the first step by clicking the **Set Properties** button, the **Decimal input** property will be required and accept only a decimal value, such as the **Credit Limit** attribute of the **Account** entity.

![Setting decimal input](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-step1.png)

### Step 2: Set new Account Credit Limit

In the second step, an **Update Record** action will assign the output of the **Get incremented Account Credit Limit** step to update the **Account Credit** limit value with the incremented value.

![Update the credit limit](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-step2.png)

## Create a Visual Studio Activity Library project

This project will create a simple workflow assembly that will increment an decimal value by 10.

1. Start Visual Studio.
1. On the **File** menu, click **New**, and then click **Project**.
1. In the **New Project** dialog box, expand **Visual C#** and select **Workflow**, and then select **Activity Library**.
1. Specify a name and location for the solution, and then click **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Choose a Solution name that makes sense for your project. In this example we will use `SampleWorkflowActivity`.

    ![create workflow activity project](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-create-workflow-activity-project.png)

1. Navigate to the **Project** menu and select **Properties**. On the **Application** tab, specify **.NET Framework 4.6.2** as the target framework.

    ![set project properties](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-workflow-project.png)

1. Delete the `Activity1.xaml` file in the project.
1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages…** .

    ![manage nuget packages](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-manage-nuget-packages.png)

1. Browse for the [Microsoft.CrmSdk.Workflow](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CrmSdk.Workflow/) NuGet package and install it.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that the package you are installing is owned by [crmsdk](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/crmsdk). This package will include the `Microsoft.Xrm.Workflow.dll` include a dependency on the [Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CrmSdk.CoreAssemblies/) package so that the required `Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.dll` assembly is included as well. 

1. You must click **I Accept** in the License Acceptance dialog.

    ![Accept license agreement](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-license-acceptance.png)

## Add a CodeActivity class

1. Add a class file (.cs) to the project. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, select **Add**, and then click **Class**. In the **Add New Item**dialog box, type a name for the class, and then click **Add**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Choose a class name that makes sense for your activity. In this example, we will name the class `IncrementByTen`.

    ![Add a class](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-add-class.png)

1. Open the IncrementByTen.cs file, and add the following using directives:

    ```csharp
    using System.Activities;
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Workflow;
    ```

1. Make the class inherit from the [CodeActivity](/dotnet/api/system.activities.codeactivity) class and give it a public access modifier as shown here:

    ```csharp
    public class IncrementByTen: CodeActivity
        {

        }
    ```

1. Add the **Execute** method from the `CodeActivity` class using Visual Studio Quick actions or manually:

    ![implement codeactivity interface](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-implement-codeactivity-interface.png)

1. The class now looks like this:

    ```csharp
    public class IncrementByTen : CodeActivity
    {
        protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }
    ```

## Define input and output parameters

1. Add a set of input and output parameters where the value of the output parameter will be the value of the input parameter incremented by 10.

    ```csharp
    public class IncrementByTen : CodeActivity
    {
        [RequiredArgument]
        [Input("Decimal input")]
        public InArgument<decimal> DecInput { get; set; }

        [Output("Decimal output")]
        public OutArgument<decimal> DecOutput { get; set; }

        protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
        {
            
        }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Notice how [.NET Attributes](/dotnet/standard/attributes) are used to provide metadata about the parameters in the assembly. More information: [Add parameters](workflow-extensions.md#add-parameters)

## Add your business logic

Add the logic within the Execute method to apply the logic to increment the input value by 10.

```csharp
    protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
    {
      decimal input = DecInput.Get(context);
      DecOutput.Set(context, input + 10);
    }
```

## Sign and build the assembly

1. Sign the assembly. In the project properties, under the **Signing** tab, select **Sign the assembly** and provide a key file name. Custom workflow activity (and plug-in) assemblies must be signed. You do not need to set a password for the purpose of this tutorial. For this example we created a new strong name key file named `SampleWorkflowActivity.snk`

    ![sign assembly](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-sign-assembly.png)

1. Build the solution in Debug mode and verify that the `SampleWorkflowActivity.dll` assembly is in the `/bin/Debug` folder.

## Register your assembly

Custom workflow activity assemblies are registered using the Plug-in Registration tool. The tool provides a graphical user interface and supports registering assemblies that contain plug-ins or custom workflow activities. To get the Plug-in Registration tool see: [Download tools from NuGet](../download-tools-nuget.md)

[!INCLUDE [cc-connect-plugin-registration-tool](../includes/cc-connect-plugin-registration-tool.md)]

### Register your assembly

1. Select **Register** > **Register New Assembly**

    ![register assembly command](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-register-assembly.png)

1. In the **Register New Assembly** dialog, click the ellipses button (**…**) and navigate to the `SampleWorkflowActivity.dll` in the `/bin/Debug` folder.

    ![register assembly dialog](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-register-assembly-dialog.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Note: With Common Data Service the only valid options for Steps 3 & 4 are selected and invalid options are disabled.

1. Click **Register Selected Plugins**. You should see a confirmation dialog.

    ![registered plug-in dialog](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-register-plug-in-dialog.png)

1. Click **OK** to close the **Register New Assembly** dialog.

### Configure activity names

1. In the list of **Registered Plugins and Custom Workflow Activities** locate the **(Assembly) SampleWorkflowActivity** and expand it to show the **(Workflow Activity) SampleWorkflow.Activity.IncrementByTen - Isolatable**.
1. Select the **(Workflow Activity) SampleWorkflow.Activity.IncrementByTen - Isolatable** and in the **Properties** area edit the **Editable properties** using the values in the following table:

    |Editable Field|Original Value|New Value|Description|
    |--|--|--|--|
    |Description||Returns the value of the input parameter plus 10.|Not visible in the UI of the process designer, but may be useful when generating documentation from data drawn from the PluginType Entity that stores this information.|
    |FriendlyName|a GUID value|IncrementByTen|User friendly name for the plug-in.|
    |Name|SampleWorkflowActivity.IncrementByTen|Increment By 10|The name of the menu represented|
    |WorkflowActivityGroupName|SampleWorkflowActivity (1.0.0.0)|Sample|The name of the submenu added to the main menu in the Common Data Service process designer.|

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Name** and **WorkflowActivityGroupName** are set to null, the custom activity will not be visible in the process designer.

1. Click the **Save** (icon) to save the changes.

    ![Save workflow activity properties](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-set-workflow-activity-properties.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values will not be visible in the unmanaged solution when you test your workflow activity. However, when you export a managed solution that includes this workflow activity these values will be visible in the process designer.

## Test your assembly

You can test your new workflow activity by creating a process that will use it. Use these steps to create the Workflow process described in the [Goal](#goal) section above:

1. Open [PowerApps](http://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc)
1. Switch the design mode from **Canvas** to **Model-Driven**.
1. Select **Solutions**.
1. Open the **Common Data Service Default Solution**.
1. Select **Processes** in the **Components** list
1. Select **New** and in the **Create Process** dialog enter the following:

    |Field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Process name|Test of SampleWorkflowActivity.IncrementByTen|
    |Category|Workflow|
    |Entity|Account|
    |Run this workflow in the background (recommended)|deselected|

    > [!NOTE]
    > The option to **Run this workflow in the background** has been de-selected to make this a real-time (synchronous) workflow. This will make testing simpler.

    ![Creating a process](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-test-activity-process.png)

1. Click **OK**
1. Apply the following changes:

    |Field|Value|
    |--|--|
    |Scope|Organization|
    |Start when: Record fields change|selected, and `name` field specified in the dialog.|

    ![configuration of a test workflow](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-configuration-test-workflow.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Setting Scope to Organization creates an on-demand workflow that can be applied by anyone in the organization.

1. Add the following **Step**:

    ![Add the SampleWorkflowActivity.IncrementByTen step](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-use-sample-step.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > As mentioned earlier, the custom values you set in [Register your assembly](#register-your-assembly) will not be applied in the designer until after the workflow activity is imported as part of a managed solution.

1. Set the Step **Description** to **Get incremented Account Credit Limit** and click **Set properties**.
1. Set the value of the **Decimal input** property to the Credit Limit of the account with a default value of 0.

    ![Set the decimal input property](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-configure-first-step.png)

1. Click **Save and Close**.
1. Add an **Update Record** step:

    ![Add an update record step](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-add-update-record-step.png)

1. Click **Set Properties** and set the value of the **Credit Limit** to the value of the **Get incremented Account Credit Limit** step.

    ![Set the value of the credit limit](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-set-credit-limit.png)

    The workflow steps should look like this:

    ![The completed workflow](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-completed-workflow.png)

1. Click **Save and Close**.
1. Activate the workflow by clicking **Activate** in the menu...

    ![activate workflow command](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-activate-command.png)

1. And click **Activate** in the **Process Activate Confirmation** dialog.

    ![Process Activate Confirmation dialog](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-process-activate-confirmation-dialog.png)

1. Navigate to a model-driven app and view a list of acccounts.
1. Select an account.
1. Edit the **Account Name** field value.
1. Save the account record.
1. Verify that the account you edited has **Credit Limit** value has increased by 10.

    ![verify account credit limit incremented](media/tutorial-create-workflow-verify-credit-limit.png)

## Add your assembly to a solution

To distribute a custom workflow activity in a solution, you must add the registered assembly that contains it to an unmanaged solution.

1. Open the unmanaged solution you want to add the assembly to using Solution Explorer.
1. Select **Plug-in Assemblies** in the list of components.
1. Click **Add Existing** in the command bar.

    ![select add existing](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-add-existing-solution-component.png)

1. In the **Select solution components** dialog, select the SampleWorkflowActivity you created and click **OK**.

    ![Add SampleWorkflowActivity](media/tutorial-create-workflow-activity-add-solution-component.png)
