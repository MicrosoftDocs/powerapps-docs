# Sample: Calculate a credit score with a custom workflow activity

This sample code is for Common Data Service for Apps. Download the complete sample here [Custom workflow activities samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Custom-Workflow-Activities-eee57285).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [sdk-prerequisite](../../../includes/sdk-prerequisite.md)]
  
## Requirements

The following customizations must exist for this custom workflow activity to work:  

-   Entity Schema Name: `new_loanapplication`  
-   Attribute: `new_loanapplicationid` as the primary key  
-   Attribute: `new_creditscore` of type `int` with min of 0 and max of 1000 (if it is to be updated)  
-   Attribute: `new_loanamount` of type money with default min/max  
-   Customize the form to include the attribute `new_loanapplicantid`  
  
The contact entity must have the following customizations:  
  
-   Attribute: `new_ssn` as **Single Line of Text** with max length of 15  
-   One-To-Many Relationship with these properties:  
    -   Relationship Definition Schema Name: `new_loanapplicant`  
    -   Relationship Definition Related Entity Display Name: Loan Application  
    -   Relationship Attribute Schema Name: `new_loanapplicantid`  
    -   Relationship Behavior Type: Referential  
  
## Demonstrates

The following sample workflow activity calculates the credit score based on the Social Security Number (SSN) and name.  
  
## Example  

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates the credit score based on the SSN and name. 
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This depends on a custom entity called Loan Application and customizations to Contact.
/// 
/// Loan Application requires the following properties:
/// <list>
///		<item>Schema Name: new_loanapplication</item>
///		<item>Attribute: new_loanapplicationid as the primary key</item>
///		<item>Attribute: new_creditscore of type int with min of 0 and max of 1000 (if it is to be updated)</item>
///		<item>Attribute: new_loanamount of type money with default min/max</item>
///		<item>Customize the form to include the attribute new_loanapplicantid</item>
/// </list>
/// 
/// Contact Requires the following customizations
/// <list>
///		<item>Attribute: new_ssn as nvarchar with max length of 15</item>
///		<item>One-To-Many Relationship with these properties:
///			<list>
///				<item>Relationship Definition Schema Name: new_loanapplicant</item>
///				<item>Relationship Definition Related Entity Name: Loan Application</item>
///				<item>Relationship Atttribute Schema Name: new_loanapplicantid</item>
///				<item>Relationship Behavior Type: Referential</item>
///			</list>
///		</item>
/// </list>
/// 
/// The activity takes, as input, a EntityReference to the Loan Application and a boolean indicating whether new_creditscore should be updated to the credit score.
/// </remarks>
/// <exception cref=">ArgumentNullException">Thrown when LoanApplication is null</exception>
/// <exception cref=">ArgumentException">Thrown when LoanApplication is not a EntityReference to a LoanApplication entity</exception>
