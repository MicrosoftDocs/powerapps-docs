# User and team entities

User and team management is the area of Common Data Service where you can create and maintain user accounts and profiles.  

 A *user* is any person who works for a business unit who uses Common Data Service. Each user has a user account. All users must be associated with only one business unit. This association controls which customer data the user will have access to. Included in the user's account is information such as the user's telephone numbers, email address, and a link to the user's manager. Each user has privileges and rights to manage their own personal settings. Each user corresponds to a user in the Azure Active Directory for that organization. When you create a user, you must assign the user to at least one security role. Even if the user is part of a team that has assigned roles, the user should be assigned to a role. For more information about access levels and roles, see [How Role-Based Security Can Be Used to Control Access to Entities In Dynamics 365](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/security-dev/how-role-based-security-control-access-entities).  

 A *team* is a group of users. Teams let users across an organization collaborate and share information. For more information about teams, see [Use Teams to Collaborate and Share Information](use-access-teams-owner-teams-collaborate-share-information.md).  

 Records can be owned by users or teams. Set the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.EntityMetadata.OwnershipType> to <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.OwnershipTypes>.`UserOwned` or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Metadata.OwnershipTypes>.`TeamOwned` to enable ownership. You can use the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.ReassignObjectsOwnerRequest> message or the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.ReassignObjectsSystemUserRequest> message to do bulk reassignment of all records for an owner.  

 The following illustration shows the entity relationships for users and teams.

## Users  
 In Common Data Service, users can be disabled but they cannot be deleted. To find the user who is currently logged on or who is impersonated, call the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.WhoAmIRequest> message.  

 The following table provides details about the significant attributes for the system user entity.

 Access checks are additive. You can access entities based on the roles assigned to the user plus the roles assigned to the team that a user is a member of. This allows a user to have privileges outside their business unit.  

> [!NOTE]
>  A user's set of privileges is a union of privileges from the user's roles and privileges from all teams’ roles in which the user is a member.  


 Non-interactive users are often used when writing service-to-service code because they do not use up a license. Common Data Service allows for five free non-interactive users. To disable a non-interactive user, update the user record changing the `accessmode` value to any other value. The user will be disabled automatically.
