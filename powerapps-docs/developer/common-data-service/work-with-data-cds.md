# Work with data using code in Common Data Service

Common Data Service has [entities](entities.md) that are used to model and manage business data. You can use standard entities or create your own custom entities to store data. 

## Use web services to work with data

Common Data Service provides two web services that you can use to interact with data: **Web API** and **Organization Service**. Choose the one that best matches the requirement and your skills.

### Web API

The Web API is an OData v4 RESTful endpoint. Use this for any programming language that supports HTTP requests and authentication using OAuth 2.0.

More information: [Use the Common Data Service Web API](webapi/overview.md) 

### Organization service

Use the .NET Framework SDK assemblies for projects that involve writing plug-ins or workflow extensions. 

More information: [Use the Common Data Service Organization Service](org-service/overview.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Use the Xrm.Tooling assemblies if you are creating a Windows client application. More information: [Build Windows client applications using the XRM tools](xrm-tooling/build-windows-client-applications-xrm-tools.md)
