# Entity relationship metadata messages

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Entity relationships define how entities are related to each other. This includes information about how relationships are represented in the application. Also, when actions are performed on a record, the relationship indicates what actions to perform on related records.  
  
The following table lists the messages that you can use to create, retrieve, update, and delete entity relationships.
