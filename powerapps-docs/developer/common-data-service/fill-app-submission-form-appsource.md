# Step 1: Fill the app submission form on AppSource

Get started by filling out an app submission form on AppSource to provide some initial details about your app.

1. Access the app submission form directly by clicking [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=865109). Alternatively, visit [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), select **List on AppSource** in the top menu of the page. On the page that appears, select **Submit Your App** at the bottom.
2. Provide information about your contact details, company, and app. All the fields marked with asterisk (*) are mandatory.
3. After filling the form, select **Submit**.

The AppSource team wil review your information, and reach out to you with details about the next steps via email.

If your app submission request is accepted, the Dynamics 365 onboarding team will grant you access to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/), which you will eventually use to [submit](next-steps-submit-app-cloud-partner-portal.md) your actual app for publishing on AppSource. To get access to the Cloud Partner Portal, you must be registered with Microsoft Partner Network (MPN). If you don't have an MPN account, see [Step 2: Register for Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) account](register-microsoft-partner-network.md).

You don't have to wait to hear back from the AppSource team. Proceed with steps 2-5 to continue preparing your app for submission while your information is being reviewed by the AppSource team.
