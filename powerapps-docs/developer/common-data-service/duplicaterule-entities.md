# Duplicate rule entities

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

For information about how to configure duplicate rules in the application, see [Administrators Guide: Set up duplicate detection rules to keep your data clean](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/set-up-duplicate-detection-rules-keep-data-clean).

Duplicate detection rules are defined using the following entities:

- [DuplicateRule](reference/entities/duplicaterule.md): To detect duplicates in the system, create a *duplicate detection rule* for a specific entity type. You can create multiple detection rules for the same entity type. However, you can publish a maximum of five duplicate detection rules per entity type at one time.  
- [DuplicateRuleCondition](reference/entities/duplicaterulecondition.md): A rule can have one or more *duplicate detection rule conditions* that are represented by the entity. The conditions are combined by the system as in logical `AND` operation. A duplicate detection rule specifies a base entity type and a matching entity type. A duplicate rule condition specifies the name of a base attribute and the name of a matching attribute. For example, specify an account as a base entity and a contact as a matching entity to compare last names and addresses. The matching criteria consist of operators such as exactly match, first n-number of characters, or last n-number of characters. 


These two entities are related using the [DuplicateRule_DuplicateRuleConditions](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_DuplicateRule_DuplicateRuleConditions) relationship.

Duplicate detection works by comparing generated match codes of existing records with each new record being created. These match codes are created as each new record is created. Therefore, there is potential for one or more duplicate records to be created if they are processed at the exact same moment. In addition to detecting duplicates as they are created, you should schedule duplicate detection jobs to check for other potential duplicate records.
 
 The duplicate detection rules are system-wide. You must publish them before running a duplicate detection job to detect duplicates for bulk data or retrieve duplicates for a particular entity record. To publish a duplicate detection rule, use the `PublishDuplicateRule` message(<xref href="Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.PublishDuplicateRule?text=PublishDuplicateRule Action" /> or <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.PublishDuplicateRuleRequest>). Duplicate rule publishing is an asynchronous operation that runs in the background.

The following writable attributes in these entities control the behavior of duplicate detection rules.

## DuplicateRule

|Attribute|Description|
|-|-|
|[BaseEntityName](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_BaseEntityName)| Record type of the record being evaluated for potential duplicates.|
|[Description](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_Description)|Description of the duplicate detection rule.|
|[DuplicateRuleId](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_DuplicateRuleId)|Unique identifier of the duplicate detection rule.|
|[ExcludeInactiveRecords](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_ExcludeInactiveRecords)|Determines whether to flag inactive records as duplicates.<br /> **Note**: <br />The default value is `false`. Set it to `true` if you do not want inactive records to be flagged as duplicates, even if they meet duplication detection rule criteria. <br /> More information: [Inactive states](#inactive-states)|
|[IsCaseSensitive](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_IsCaseSensitive)|Indicates if the operator is case-sensitive.|
|[MatchingEntityName](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_MatchingEntityName)|Record type of the records being evaluated as potential duplicates.|
|[Name](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_Name)|Name of the duplicate detection rule.|
|[OwnerId](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_OwnerId)|Unique identifier of the user or team who owns the duplicate detection rule.|
|[OwnerIdType](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_OwnerIdType)|Whether the owner is a user or a team.|
|[StatusCode](/reference/entities/duplicaterule.md#BKMK_StatusCode)|Reason for the status of the duplicate detection rule.|

### Inactive states

Most system entities and all custom entities have two `StateCode` attribute options:

- `Value`: 0 `InvariantName`: `Active`
- `Value`: 1 `InvariantName`: `Inactive`

The label of the option may be changed, but the `InvariantName` value will not.

Some system entities will have more than one active or inactive state.The following table lists examples of entities with more than one active or inactive state.

|Entity StateCode |Active State(s)|Inactive State(s)|  
|--|--|--|  
|[Appointment.StateCode](/reference/entities/appointment.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`, `Scheduled`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[CampaignActivity.StateCode](/reference/entities/CampaignActivity.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Closed`, `Canceled`|  
|[CampaignResponse.StateCode](/reference/entities/CampaignResponse.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Contract.StateCode](/reference/entities/Contract.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Draft`, `Invoiced`, `On Hold`|`Canceled`, `Expired`|  
|[ContractDetail.StateCode](/reference/entities/ContractDetail.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Existing`, `Renewed`|`Canceled`, `Expired`|  
|[Email.StateCode](/reference/entities/Email.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Fax.StateCode](/reference/entities/Fax.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Incident.StateCode](/reference/entities/Incident.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Active`|`Resolved`, `Canceled`, `Closed`|  
|[Invoice.StateCode](/reference/entities/Invoice.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Active`|`Closed`, `Paid`, `Canceled`|  
|[KbArticle.StateCode](/reference/entities/KbArticle.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Draft`, `Unapproved`, `Published`|N/A|  
|[Lead.StateCode](/reference/entities/Lead.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Qualified`, `Disqualified`|  
|[Letter.StateCode](/reference/entities/Letter.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Opportunity.StateCode](/reference/entities/Opportunity.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Won`, `Lost`|  
|[PhoneCall.StateCode](/reference/entities/PhoneCall.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Quote.StateCode](/reference/entities/Quote.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Draft`, `Active`|`Won`, `Closed`|  
|[SalesOrder.StateCode](/reference/entities/SalesOrder.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Active`, `Submitted`, `Invoiced`|`Canceled`, `Fulfilled`|  
|[ServiceAppointment.StateCode](/reference/entities/ServiceAppointment.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`, `Scheduled`|`Closed`, `Canceled`|  
|[Task.StateCode](/reference/entities/Task.md#BKMK_StateCode)|`Open`|`Completed`, `Canceled`|  

 For example, if you set the `ExcludeInactiveRecords` attribute to `true`, only `Active`, `Submitted`, and `Invoiced` sales orders will be considered for matching during duplicate detection. 


> [!NOTE]
> You can review the available `StateCode` options for an entity using the Metadata Browser described in [Browse the metadata for your organization](browse-your-metadata.md).
>
> To retrieve the `StateCode` options for an entity you can use the following Web API query  by substituting the `LogicalName` of the entity with `appointment` used below:
> ```HTTP
> GET [organization URI]/api/data/v9.0/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='appointment')/Attributes(LogicalName='statecode')/Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.StateAttributeMetadata/OptionSet?$select=Options

## DuplicateRuleCondition Special messages

[DuplicateRuleCondition](/reference/entities/duplicaterulecondition.md) is a child entity to `DuplicateRule`. Access to retrieve or modify these entities is dependent on access to the `DuplicateRule` it is associated with. More information: [DuplicateRuleCondition Messages](/reference/entities/duplicaterulecondition.md#messages).

The following special messages can also be used:

|Message|Web API Operation|SDK Assembly|
|-|-|-|
|CompoundUpdateDuplicateDetectionRule|<xref href="Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.CompoundUpdateDuplicateDetectionRule?text=CompoundUpdateDuplicateDetectionRule Action" />|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.CompoundUpdateDuplicateDetectionRuleRequest>|
