# Behavior of specialized update operations

There are several deprecated specialized messages that perform update operations. In earlier versions it was required to use these messages, but now the same operations should be performed using <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> class with <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Execute*>

[!INCLUDE [cc-legacy-update-messages](includes/cc-legacy-update-messages.md)]

More information: [Legacy update messages](org-service/entity-operations-update-delete.md#legacy-update-messages) 

This change introduced some special behaviors that should be noted for plug-ins and workflows. 

## For Plug-ins

When update requests are processed that include both owner fields plus other standard fields for business owned entities, plug-ins registered for the **Update** message in **PreOperation** and/or **PostOperation** stages execute once for all non-owner fields, and then once for the owner fields. Examples of owner fields would be `businessunit` and `manager` (for a [SystemUser Entity](reference/entities/systemuser.md)). Examples of business owned entities include [SystemUser](reference/entities/systemuser.md), [BusinessUnit](reference/entities/businessunit.md),[Equipment](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/entities/equipment) and [Team](reference/entities/team.md).

When update requests are processed that include both state/status fields plus other standard fields, plug-ins registered for the **Update** message in **PreOperation** and/or **PostOperation** stages execute once for all non-state/status fields, and then once for the state/status fields.

In order for plug-in code to receive the full data changes of the update, you must register the plug-in in the **PreOperation** and then store relevant information in <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext.SharedVariables> in the plug-in context for later plug-ins (in the pipeline) to consume.

## For Workflows

When update requests are processed that include both owner fields plus other standard fields, workflows registered for the **Update** message execute once for all non-owner fields, and then once for the owner fields. Workflows registered for the **Assign** message by users continue to be triggered by updates to owner fields.

When update requests are processed that include both state/status fields plus other standard fields, workflows registered for the **Update** message execute once for all non-state/status fields, and then once for the state/status fields. Workflows registered for the **Change Status** step continue to be triggered by updates to state/status fields.
