# Authenticate to Common Data Service for Apps with the Web API


You must use OAuth as described in [Connect to web services using OAuth](../connect-web-services-using-oauth.md).<br />

  
If you’re creating a single page application (SPA) using JavaScript you can use the adal.js library as described in [Use OAuth with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  to connect a Single Page Application](../oauth-cross-origin-resource-sharing-connect-single-page-application.md).
