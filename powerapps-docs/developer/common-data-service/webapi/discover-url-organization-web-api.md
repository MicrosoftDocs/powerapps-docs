# Discover the URL for your organization using the Web API

[!INCLUDE [cc-discovery-service-description](../includes/cc-discovery-service-description.md)]

With the Web API discovery service, you can use standard `$filter` and `$select` parameters to a Web API service request to customize the returned list of instance data.
<!-- TODO should only talk about the global discovery service -->
In addition to datacenter specific Discovery services, that are available on the 2011 (SOAP) endpoint and through the Web API, there is also a Web API only global Discovery service that spans all operational datacenters. For more information about the Discovery service on the 2011 endpoint see [Discovery Service](../org-service/discovery-service.md)

  
## Information provided by the Discovery service 
 
 Organization information is stored in the `Instance` entity of the Discovery service.  To see the kind of information contained in that entity, send an HTTP GET request to the service for one of your instances.  
  
```http  
GET https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v1.0/Instances(UniqueName='myorg')  
```  
  
In the above example, the global Discovery service of CDS for Apps is used to obtain the organization information of the instance with a unique name of "myorg". More details about this request is expanded upon later in this topic.  
  
### Scope of the returned information

For the global Discovery service, the `Instances` entity set, returns the set of instances that the user has access to across all geographies, when no filters are applied.   The returned data has a scope as described below.  
  
-   Includes all instances in the commercial cloud where the user is provisioned and enabled, except sovereign clouds instances are not returned
-   Does not  include instances where the user's account is disabled
-   Does not include instances where users have been filtered out based on an instance security group
-   Does not include instances where the user has access as a result of being a delegated administrator
-   If the calling user has access to no instances, the response simply returns an empty list

## How to access the Discovery services

In general, the Web API address of the Discovery service has the following format: `<service base address>/api/discovery/`.  The addresses for  each deployment type are identified below. You can easily  find the Web API addresses and version number for your deployment in the CDS for Apps web application by navigating to **Settings > Customization > Developer Resources**  
  
### CDS for Apps Discovery services  

The service base address of the global Discovery service is : `https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/`. This results in the service address of `https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/`.  
  
<!-- TODO:
The service base address of the Discovery service for a datacenter is : `https://disco.crm[N].dynamics.com/`. This results in the Discovery service address of `https://disco.crm[N].dynamics.com/api/discovery/`. Each datacenter has an N number associated with it. For a complete list of available CDS for Apps datacenters, and their N numbers,  see [Download endpoints using Developer resources page](../developer-resources-page.md).   -->
  
## Using the Discovery service  

An entity set named `Instances` is used to obtain instance information. You can use `$select` and `$filter` with the Instances entity set to filter the returned data. You can also use `$metadata` to obtain the metadata document of the service.  
  
### Authentication

CDS for Apps Web API instances of the Discovery service require authentication with OAuth access tokens. On-premise or IFD instances of the Discovery Web API adopt the authentication model of their deployment, supporting either Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) or OAuth tokens from a trusted token provider. Web Application Session authentication is not supported.  
  
When the Discovery service is configured for OAuth authentication, a request sent  to the service Web API without an access token triggers a bearer challenge with the authority of the “common” endpoint and the resource ID of the service.  Similarly, when an on-premise deployment is configured for OAuth, a bearer challenge returns the on-premise authority URL and the resource ID of the service.  
  
### Web API versioning

Versioning of the Discovery service for a datacenter or on-premises/IFD is supported and is consistent with version numbering as used by the Organization service . However, the global Discovery service of CDS for Apps is not tied to the version number of the CDS for Apps deployment. Instead, the global service uses its own version numbering. As of this writing, the global Discovery service of CDS for Apps is at version 1.0 (v1.0). For example:  
  
```http  
GET https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v1.0/Instances(UniqueName='myorg')  
```  
  
### CORS support

The Discovery service Web API supports the CORS standard for cross-origin access as does the Web API.  For more information about CORS support see [Use OAuth with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  to connect a Single Page Application](../oauth-cross-origin-resource-sharing-connect-single-page-application.md).  
  
### Examples  
  
-   Get the details of a specific instance. If you leave out the GUID, all instances that the authenticated user has access to are returned.  
  
    ```http  
    GET https://disco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v8.1/Instances(<guid>)  
    GET https://dev.crm.external.contoso.com/api/discovery/v8.1/Instances(<guid>)  
    ```  
  
-   You can use the UniqueName attribute as an alternate key.  
  
    ```http  
    GET https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v1.0/Instances(UniqueName='myorg')  
    ```  
  
-   Retrieve a list of available instances, filtered by production type.  
  
    ```http  
    GET https://globaldisco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v1.0/Instances?$select=DisplayName,Description&$filter=Type+eq+0   
    ```  
  
-   Retrieve a specific instance's ID property value.  
  
    ```http  
    GET https://disco.crm.dynamics.com/api/discovery/v8.1/Instances(UniqueName='myorg')/Id/$value  
    ```
