# Annotation (note) entity

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The *annotations (notes)* provide easy ways to append additional information to any record in the 
Common Data Service database. An annotation (note) is a text entry that can be associated with any entity in 
Common Data Service. However, you can associate annotations with only those custom entities that are created with 
the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest.HasNotes> property set to `true` in the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.CreateEntityRequest> class. You can update a 
custom entity, which is not enabled for notes, to have notes by setting the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateEntityRequest.HasNotes> property to `true`.  

Using the Web API, set the `HasNotes` property of the <xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.EntityMetadata> EntityType controls this.
  
 The `Annotation` entity represents an annotation (note), and contains the following information:  
  
-   Annotation (note) text  
  
-   Who created and modified the annotation (note)  
  
-   Whether a file is attached to the annotation (note)  
  
 An attached file can be any standard computer file format that includes Office Word documents, Office Excel spreadsheets, CAD files, and PDF files. An attachment can be associated with any object, other than an annotation (note), in Common Data Service.  
  
 To upload or remove an attachment, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService.Update*> method or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Messages.UpdateRequest> message, setting the `Annotation.Filename` and `Annotation.MimeType` properties. This uploads an attachment that has been decoded into a base64 string format. The [System.Convert.ToBase64String](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.convert.tobase64string.aspx) method can be used to convert the contents of a data file into a base64-formatted string. The maximum size of files that can be uploaded is determined by the **Organization.MaxUploadFileSize** property. This property is set in the **Email** tab of the **System Settings** in the Dynamics 365 application. This setting limits the size of files that can be attached to email messages, notes, and web resources. The default setting is 5 MB.
