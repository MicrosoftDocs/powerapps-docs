# Write a custom Azure-aware plug-in

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/write-custom-azure-aware-plugin -->

Writing a plug-in that works with Azure is similar to writing any other Dynamics 365 Common Data Service plug-in. However, in addition to invoking any desired web service methods, the plug-in must include code to initiate posting the execution context to the Azure Service Bus.  
  
<a name="bkmk_design"></a>

## Plug-in design considerations  
For a plug-in that executes synchronously, the recommended design is for the plug-in to send a message to Azure for the purpose of retrieving information from a listener application or other external service. Use of a two-way or REST contract on the Azure Service Bus endpoint allows a data string to be returned to the plug-in.  
  
It is not recommended that a synchronous plug-in use the Azure Service Bus to update data with an external service. Problems can arise if the external service becomes unavailable or if there is a lot of data to update. Synchronous plug-ins should execute fast and not hold up all logged in users of an organization while a lengthy operation is performed. In addition, if a rollback of the current core operation that invoked the plug-in occurs, any data changes made by the plug-in are undone. This could leave Dynamics 365 and an external service in an unsynchronized state.  
  
Note that it is possible for synchronous registered plug-ins to post the execution context to the Azure Service Bus.

## Write the plug-in code 
 
In the following sample plug-in code has been added to obtain the Azure service provider and initiate posting the execution context to the service bus by calling <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IServiceEndpointNotificationService.Execute(Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.EntityReference,Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IExecutionContext)>. Tracing code has been added to facilitate debugging of the plug-in because the plug-in must run in the sandbox.  

> [!NOTE]
> The `serviceEndpointId` passed into the constructor in this code is the one you get from creating a service endpoint as described in [Walkthrough: Configure Azure (SAS) for integration with Common Data Service](walkthrough-configure-azure-sas-integration.md)
>
> You can query available service endpoints for your environment using a `GET` request to Web API using your browser with a query like this: *`[organization Uri]`*`/api/data/v9.0/serviceendpoints?$select=name,description,serviceendpointid`

            }

        public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)

            ITracingService tracingService = (ITracingService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(ITracingService));
            if (tracingService == null)
                throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException("Failed to retrieve the tracing service.");

            IServiceEndpointNotificationService cloudService = (IServiceEndpointNotificationService)serviceProvider.GetService(typeof(IServiceEndpointNotificationService));
            if (cloudService == null)
                throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException("Failed to retrieve the service bus service.");

            try
            {
                tracingService.Trace("Posting the execution context.");
                string response = cloudService.Execute(new EntityReference("serviceendpoint", serviceEndpointId), context);
                if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(response))
                {
                    tracingService.Trace("Response = {0}", response);
                }
                tracingService.Trace("Done.");
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                tracingService.Trace("Exception: {0}", e.ToString());
                throw;
            }
        }
    }
}
```  
  
In your plug-in code, you can update the writeable data in the context before initiating the post. For example, you can add a key/value pair to the shared variables in the context.

## Plug-in registration

There are a few restrictions when you register a Azure aware custom plug-in. The plug-in must be registered to execute in the sandbox. Because of this, the plug-in is limited to calling <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> methods, Azure solution methods, or accessing a network using a web client. No other external access, such as access to a local file system, is allowed.  
  
For a plug-in registered to execute in asynchronous mode, this also means that the order of plug-in execution compared to other asynchronous plug-ins is not guaranteed. In addition, asynchronous plug-ins always execute after the Dynamics 365 core operation.  
  
<a name="bkmk_failure"></a>
 
## Handle a failed service bus post

The expected behavior from a failed service bus post is dependent on whether the plug-in was registered for synchronous or asynchronous execution. For asynchronous plug-ins, the system job that actually posts the execution context to the service bus will retry the post. For a synchronous registered plug-in, an exception is returned. More information [Management and Notification of Run-time Errors](azure-integration.md)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  For asynchronous registered plug-ins only, when the asynchronous job that posts to the Azure Service Bus is retried after a post failure, the entire plug-in logic is executed again. Because of this, don't add any other logic to the custom Azure aware plug-in other than just modifying the context and posting to the service bus.  
  
For a plug-in registered to execute asynchronously, the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.RemoteExecutionContext> contained in the body of the message that is sent over the service bus includes a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.RemoteExecutionContext.OperationId> property and a <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.RemoteExecutionContext.OperationCreatedOn> property. These properties contain the same data as the `AsyncOperationId` and `CreatedOn` attributes of the related System Job (`AsyncOperation`) record. These additional properties facilitate sequencing and duplicate detection if the Azure Service Bus post must be retried.
