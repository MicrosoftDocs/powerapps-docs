# Verify certification dependencies for plug-ins making outbound calls

**Category**: Maintainability, Supportability

**Impact potential**: High

<a name='symptoms'></a>

## Symptoms

You may get this error when your plug-in makes an https call to an external resource:

`WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.`


<a name='guidance'></a>

## Guidance

You should verify that the site you want to connect with has a valid chain of certificates. Use one of the online test tools such as [Qualys SSL Labs SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) to verify that the site provides a valid chain of certificates.


<a name='additional'></a>

## Additional information

You may encounter this when connecting to a new endpoint for the first time or when something about the certificate has changed.

When the code in your plug-in running in the sandbox attempts to connect to an external endpoint using https, the CDS Sandbox will start SSL/TLS negotiation. The endpoint presents a certificate to use for encryption. If the certificate has one or more intermediate certificates it must present the entire chain to successfully complete SSL/TLS negotiation. If the complete chain is not presented SSL/TLS communication cannot be established.
