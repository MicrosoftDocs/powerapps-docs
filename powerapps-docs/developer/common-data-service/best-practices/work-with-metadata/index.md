# Best practices and guidance while working with metadata for the Common Data Service

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This list below contains all of the guidance and best practices regarding interacting and working with metadata within the Common Data Service.


|Best Practice  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[Retrieve published metadata](retrieve-published-metadata.md)     |Retrieving unpublished metadata not only will add overhead to processing the request itself, performing more slowly, it could also return metadata that the requestor does not expect.         |
|[Retrieve specific columns for an entity via query APIs](retrieve-specific-columns-entity-via-query-apis.md)     |Queries submitted to retrieve data should include specific columns in the ColumnSet instance associated to the query rather than All Columns.         |
