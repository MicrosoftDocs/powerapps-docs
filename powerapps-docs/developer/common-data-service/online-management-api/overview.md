# Online Management API for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps

Online Management API is a REST API that lets you create and manage Customer Engagement instances in your Office 365 tenant. 

Application publishers and ISVs can use the Online Management API to:
-  Automate creation of custom demo Customer Engagement instances
-  Manage multiple Customer Engagement instances in case of multi-org setup in their enterprise 

Using the Online Management API, you can perform various tasks on your online instance such as create, retrieve, delete, backup and restore instances, and other instance-related tasks.
