# Sample: Execute multiple requests

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

This sample shows how to execute multiple organization message requests by using a single web service method call, passing [ExecuteMultipleRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.executemultiplerequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) as a parameter. Reducing the number of message requests that must be transmitted over the network results in increased message processing performance.

You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/ExecutemultipleRequests).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `ExecuteMultipleRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to execute one or more messages requests as a single batch operation, and optionally return a collection of results.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `ExecuteMultipleRequest` method creates the `ExecuteMultipleRequest` object.
1. The `ExecutingMultipleSettings` method assigns settings that define execution behavior: continue on error, return responses.
1. The `OrganizationRequestCollection` method creates an empty organization request collection.
1. The `CreateRequest` method is added for each entity to the request collection.
1. The `GetCollectionOdEntitiesToUpdate` class updates the entities that are previously created.


### Clean up

Display an option to delete the records created in the [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
