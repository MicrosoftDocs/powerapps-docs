# Sample: Query the working hours of a user

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/sample-query-working-hours-user -->

This sample shows how to retrieve the working hours of a user by using the [QueryScheduleRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.queryschedulerequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/QueryWorkingHours
).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `QueryScheduleRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to search the specified resource for an available time block that matches specified parameters.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `WhoAMIRequest` message gets the current user's information.
2. The `QueryScheduleRequest` message retrieves the working hours of the current user.

### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
