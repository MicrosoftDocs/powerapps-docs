# Retrieve license information

This sample shows how to use the [IDeploymentService.RetrieveDeploymentLicenseTypeRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievedeploymentlicensetyperequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message and the [IOrganizationService.RetrieveLicenseInfoRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievelicenseinforequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message to retrieve information about licenses.

You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/RetrieveLicenseInformation).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The [IDeploymentService.RetrieveDeploymentLicenseTypeRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievedeploymentlicensetyperequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data  that is needed to retrieve the type of license for a deployment of Common Data Service.

The [IOrganizationService.RetrieveLicenseInfoRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievelicenseinforequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains data that is needed to retrieve the number of used and available licenses for a deployment of Common Data Service.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

### Demonstrate

1. The `deploymentTypeRequest` method creates a request to retrieve the deployment license types.
2. The `licenseInfoRequest` message creates request to retrieve the licensed info request.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No cleanup is required.
