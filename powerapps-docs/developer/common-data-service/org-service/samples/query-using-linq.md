# Sample: Query data using LINQ

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

These samples show how to query business data using [Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries). You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/QueriesUsingLINQ). 

## How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/cds/README.md) for information about how to run this sample. There are multiple projects in the solution. Each project demonstrates some aspect of LINQ queries.

## What this sample does

Read each sample's comments to find out what each sample does. There are samples that:
* Create a simple LINQ query
* Create a LINQ query using entity late binding
* Retrieve multiple records using condition operators
* Complex queries - a wide assortment of LINQ examples

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Creates any entity instances required by the `Demonstrate` region of each `Main`() method.

### Demonstrate

Code in the `Demonstrate` region of the `Main`() method performs one or more LINQ queries.

### Clean up

Displays an option to delete the records created in [Setup](#setup).

The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
