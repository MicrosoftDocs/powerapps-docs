# Sample: Create an email using a template

This sample shows how to instantiate an email record by using [InstantiateTemplateRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.instantiatetemplaterequest?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) message. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/EmailTemplate). 

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]

## What this sample does

The `InstantiateTemplateRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it instantiates an email record.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
1. Creates an account record. 
2. Defines the body and subject of the email template in **XML** format.
3. Creates an email template.

### Demonstrate

1. The `InstantiateTemplateRequest` message is used to create an email message using a template. 
2. Serialize the email message to **XML** and save to a file.


### Clean up

Display an option to delete the record created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
