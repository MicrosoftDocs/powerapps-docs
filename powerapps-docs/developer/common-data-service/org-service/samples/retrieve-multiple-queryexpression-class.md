This sample shows how to retrieve multiple entities using the [IOrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple(QueryBase)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iorganizationservice.retrievemultiple?view=dynamics-general-ce-9#Microsoft_Xrm_Sdk_IOrganizationService_RetrieveMultiple_Microsoft_Xrm_Sdk_Query_QueryBase_) method with [QueryExpression](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.query.queryexpression?view=dynamics-general-ce-9) along with their related entity columns. You can download the sample from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23/RetrieveMultipleByQueryExpression).

## How to run this sample

[!include[cc-how-to-run-samples](../../includes/cc-how-to-run-samples.md)]


## What this sample does

The `QueryExpression` class is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains a complex query expressed in a hierarchy of expressions.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. Creates multiple accounts with primary contacts.
1. The `QueryExpression` class creates a query expression specifying the link entity alias and the columns of the link entity that you want to return.

### Clean up

No clean up is required.
