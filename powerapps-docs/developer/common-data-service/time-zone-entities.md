# Time zone entities

> [!NOTE]
> The *time zone rule* entity is deprecated. The time conversion calculation is now provided by Microsoft Windows. Refer to this article for more information: [Microsoft policy in response to daylight saving time and time zone changes](https://support.microsoft.com/help/22803/daylight-saving-time).

The *time zone* entities can be used when you write code that works in multiple time zones. The following two read-only entities in Common Data Service contain time zone information:  
  
- The *time zone definition entity* stores basic information about each supported time zone, including the time zone code and the standard time zone name.
  
- The *time zone localized name* entity stores the localized time zone names.  
  
The following table lists the messages that are related to time zones, but donâ€™t refer to a specific entity.  
  
|Message|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.GetTimeZoneCodeByLocalizedNameRequest>|Retrieves all the time zone definitions for the specified locale, returning only the display name attribute.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.LocalTimeFromUtcTimeRequest>|Retrieves the local time for the specified UTC time.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages.UtcTimeFromLocalTimeRequest>|Retrieves the UTC time for the specified local time.|
