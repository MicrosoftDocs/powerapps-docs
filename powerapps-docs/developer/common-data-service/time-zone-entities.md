# Time zone entities

The *time zone* entities can be used when you write code that works in multiple time zones. The following three read-only entities in Common Data Service contain time zone information:  
  
- The *time zone definition entity* stores basic information about each supported time zone, including the time zone code and the standard time zone name.  
  
- The *time zone localized name* entity stores the localized time zone names.  
  
- The *time zone rule* entity stores information about how times are calculated.  
  
  The following table lists the messages that are related to time zones, but donâ€™t refer to a specific entity.
