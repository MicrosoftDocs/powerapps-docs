# Walkthrough: Configure assembly security for an offline plug-in

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The Common Data Service platform applies an additional security restriction to registered offline plug-in assemblies. When DynamicsÂ 365 for Microsoft Office Outlook with Offline Access is installed, an AllowList key is added to the system registry on the client computer. For each assembly containing an offline plug-in that you register, you must add a registry sub-key under the AllowList key with the key name derived from the assembly's public key token. Failure to add this key results in the offline plug-in not being executed by the platform even though the plug-in is registered. This walkthrough describes how to add this sub-key for a plug-in assembly.  
  
### Get the public key token  
  
1.  Load the assembly containing the offline plug-in into the Plug-in Registration tool. For more information about how to use the tool, see [Register a plug-in](../register-plug-in.md).  
  
2.  Select the plug-in assembly in the tree view of the tool.  
  
3.  Copy (Ctrl+C) the value in the **Public Key Token** field into the paste buffer.  
  
### Add an AllowList key  
  
1.  Run the registry editor by selecting **Start**, then select **Run** and type `regedit.exe`.  
  
2.  In the tree view pane, navigate to the **AllowList** key. The complete path of the key is `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MSCRMClient\AllowList`.  
  
3.  Select the **AllowList** key and right click to display the context menu.  
  
4.  Select **New** then click **Key** to create a new sub-key.  
  
5.  Paste the public key token value into the name of the new sub-key.  
  
6.  Close the registry editor.
