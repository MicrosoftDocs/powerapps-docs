Dynamics 365 for Outlook lets users interact with data while they’re offline and not connected to a server. Common Data Service includes features that let you extend your solutions to offline scenarios by calling the web services offline from your custom code. In addition, the <xref:Microsoft.Crm.Outlook.Sdk> assembly provides programmatic support for basic Outlook actions such as synchronization, going offline or online, and Dynamics 365 for Outlook state verification. Offline programming uses the ASP.NET Development Server.  
  
 Dynamics 365 includes features that allow administrators to customize and manage filters for their users. Filter templates provide the starting point for entity synchronization on Dynamics 365 for Outlook. Filters determine which entity collections are synchronized to Outlook and to SQL Server 2008 Express Edition for offline-enabled Dynamics 365 solutions.
