 You can also assign a record to a team, or to yourself.  
  
1. Go to **Accounts** or **Contacts**. [How do I get there?](../basics/navigation-customer-engagement-enterprise.md)  
  
2. In the list of records, select the record that you want.  
  
    In the command bar, click the **More Commands** button![More commands button](media/morecommands.gif "More commands button"), and then click **Assign**.
