# How do I find and run apps?

No need to manually work on a task to get your work done. With Power Apps, you can create and use a canvas app or model-driven app to get your work done quickly. Once you create an app, you can share the app with your organization. 

[Canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) give you a lot of control over the user experience of the app. An app maker can use templates to create a canvas app, or they can configure the app any way they like. A canvas app, like its name, is a blank canvas, so you can create an app to fit the needs of users in your organization.

Because canvas apps can essentially be anything, there isn’t much help documentation on how to use an app once it’s created. If you need help using a canvas app, contact your app maker or Power Apps admin.

[Model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) use the [Unified Interface](unified-interface.md) that provides a responsive and accessible design. You can run the app on a web browser or on popular mobile devices. The app has multiple components including dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes that together help make the app easy to use.

This section provides information about how to find and run canvas and model-driven apps from various places. It also provides information on how to navigate and work within a model-driven app: [Use model-driven apps](use-model-driven-apps.md).


## What's required to run apps?
- Ensure that you're using a [supported device platform and browser](../maker/canvas-apps/limits-and-config.md).
- To run canvas apps, download and install Power Apps from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/powerapps/id1047318566?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps).
- To run model-driven apps:
    - on a phone, download and install Dynamics 365 for phones from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/dynamics-crm-for-phones/id1003997947?ls=1&mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.crm.crmphone). 
    - on a tablet, download Dynamics 365 for tablets from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-dynamics-crm/id678800460?mt=8), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.crm.crmtablet), or [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/microsoft-dynamics-365/9nblggh4rfqp).
