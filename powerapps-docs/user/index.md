# How do I find and run apps?

No need to manually work on a task to get your work done. With PowerApps, you can create and use a canvas app or model-driven app to get your work done quickly. Once you create an app, you can share the app with your organization. 

[Canvas apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) give you a lot of control over the user experience of the app. An app maker can use templates to create a canvas app], or they can configure the app any way they like. A canvas app, like its name, is a blank canvas, so you can create an app to fit the needs of users in your organization.

Because canvas apps can essentially be anything, there isn’t much help documentation on how to use an app once it’s created. If you need help using a canvas app, contact your app maker or PowerApps admin.

[Model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) use the [Unified Interface](unified-interface.md) that provides a responsive and accessible design. You can run the app on a web browser or on popular mobile devices. The app has multiple components including dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes that together help make the app easy to use. Model-driven apps are built and modeled on the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement framework, so the user experience is similar to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement [apps](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/business-apps-dynamics-365).

This section provides information about how to find and run canvas and model-driven apps from various places; also provides informaation on how to navigate and work within model-driven apps.
