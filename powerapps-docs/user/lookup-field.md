#  Use the lookup column on a row

Lookup helps you to choose rows from a related table. When you select a related table and enter search criteria, such as a name or email address, lookup automatically begins to resolve the partial text and displays any matching rows. If no rows are displayed after you have typed the full text of your search criteria, a message is displayed specifying that there are no rows.

For example, you might search for the name **Adrian Dumitrascu**. When you type **ad**, possible matching rows are automatically populated and displayed.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Automatically populates matching rows](media/automatically-populate-matching-records.png "Automatically populates matching rows")
  
>[!NOTE] 
>An administrator can define the criteria that lookup uses for resolving partial search text.

Also, you can create a new row by selecting the **New** button. You must have sufficient permissions to view the **New** button and create a row. When you select the lookup column, the five most recently used rows are displayed along with five favorite rows. Which rows are displayed depends on your view history and the favorites you’ve pinned. 

For example, if you have only three rows in your history, lookup will display those three,
along with seven of your favorite rows. If you have not pinned any favorites, only the most recently viewed rows will be displayed.

## Types of lookups

Lookups are classified into the following: 

- **Simple lookup:** Select a single row in a column from a single table. 

- **PartyList-type columns:** Use to select multiple rows from multiple tables in a lookup. Use partylist-type columns to select multiple rows. This allows you to add each row by performing a new search, multiple times. Every time you select a row, you will be able to perform a new search for another row.
  
- **Regarding-type columns:** Use to select a single row from multiple tables in a lookup. Activities must be enabled for a table to use the Regarding lookup. For more information: [Enable activities for a table](../maker/data-platform/types-of-entities.md#enable-activities-for-a-table)


## Search in a lookup column 
To search a lookup, select the textbox and type your search criteria. If recent rows are enabled for your lookup, your recent rows will be displayed when you select the textbox.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Browse a lookup column](media/MRU.png "Browse a lookup column")  
  
>[!NOTE]   
> The default search result for lookup search is, **begins with**. This means results include rows that begin with a specific word. For example, if you want to search for **Alpine Ski House**, type **alp** in the search box; if you type **ski**, the row will not show up in the search result.
>
> For a wildcard search use asterisks: For example, type \*ski or \*ski\*.

## Browse in a lookup column
To browse a lookup, select the lookup icon (magnifying glass). A full list of items will be shown in the dropdown.

## Most recently used row type images
The most recently used list of rows shows an image to help distinguish between row types.

>[!NOTE] 
>Recent rows are not filtered by search term, selected view or related rows.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Lookup columns shows image](media/Lookup_03-MRU_Entity_Images_56[1].png "Lookup columns shows image")  
  
## Row type selection list  
When results span multiple row types, you can see how many types of rows there are and select them from the list. The **Lookup Row** option is not available in Unified Interface. Instead, use the following to search:

- To look for rows, enter text in the search box. 
- To search by table type select **types of rows**. 
- Select **Change View** to select a view.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![See how many rows](media/Lookup_04-MultipleEntityTypes[1].gif "See how many rows")  
  
  
## Create a new row if you don’t find an existing row

If you do not find a row, select **New** in the lookup area to create a new row.


### Replace an existing row from a lookup column

You can replace an existing row while using simple and regarding-type lookups. Search for a row. Then select the row, and replace it with a new row.

### Change a view in a lookup column 

Selecting **Change View** lets you determine:
 - How you want to view rows such as **Contacts Being Followed**, **Contacts Lookup View**, or **Active Contacts**.
 - What you want to view in the rows, such as name, email, or telephone number. For example, if you want to view only the contacts that you follow, select
    **Change View** \> **Contacts being followed**. Only the contacts that you are following will be displayed, as illustrated here. 

    ![Change view contacts types](media/change-view.png "Change view contacts types")

### Filter by, Only my rows or Filter by related primary contact

To apply extra filters, in the **Change View** menu, select **Only my rows** or **Filter by related Primary Contact**.

![Add more filters](media/extra_filters.png "Add more filters")

### Choose from multiple rows

When lookup has more rows in a column than can fit in the available display area, the display area is collapsed—that is, the rows that do fit the display area are shown next to the number of rows that are not shown. To view all rows, select the number. The following images show the difference between collapsed and non-collapsed columns.

**Collapsed:**
