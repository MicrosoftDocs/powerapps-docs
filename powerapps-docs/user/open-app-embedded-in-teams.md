# Add an app to Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based collaboration platform built on Office 365 technologies. You can customize the Teams experience by adding Power Apps canvas apps to your channels in Teams. 

For detailed information about how to add the Product Showcase sample app to a Teams channel and then open the app from the channel, see [Embed a canvas app as a tab app](/powerapps/teams/embed-teams-tab) in **Power Apps and Teams integration** section.
