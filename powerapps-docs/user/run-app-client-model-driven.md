# Run a model-driven app on a mobile device

After the app is created and then shared with you, you can run that app on the Dynamics 365 mobile app or in a web browser on tablet. In this topic, you'll learn how to run a model-driven app on a mobile device. 

To follow this procedure, if you're not signed up for Power Apps, [sign up for free](https://make.powerapps.com/signup?redirect=marketing&email=) before you begin. Also, make sure you have access to an app that you created or that someone else created and shared with you.

## Run the model-driven app

Model-driven apps don't run in the Power Apps mobile app. Instead, you run a model-driven app on a mobile device using the Dynamics 365 mobile app. If you don't have the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app installed, you can still use the web browser on your tablet, as long as your device has sufficiently high screen resolution. However, for full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets mobile app. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using the web browser on your phone to run your model-driven apps isn't supported; you must use the Dynamics 365 for phones app. 

### Use the mobile app
Install the Dynamics 365 for phones or Dynamics 365 for tablets app from your deviceâ€™s app store. More information: [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets)

### Run in your tablet's browser
Go to the [Dynamics 365 home page](https://home.dynamics.com) or enter the app URL directly into your tablet's web browser and follow the directions on your screen to load the app. More information: [What's supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/support-phones-tablets#supported-tablets-to-run-model-driven-apps-in-your-web-browser)
