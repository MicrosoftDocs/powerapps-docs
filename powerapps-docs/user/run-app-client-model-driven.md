# Run a model-driven app on a mobile device

After the app is created and then shared with you, you can run that app on a variety of popular mobile devices such as Windows, iOS, Android, or in a web browser. In this topic, you'll learn how to run a model-driven app on a mobile device. 

To follow this procedure, if you're not signed up for PowerApps, [sign up for free](https://web.powerapps.com/signup?redirect=marketing&email=) before you begin. Also, make sure you have access to an app that you created or that someone else created and shared with you.

## Run the model-driven app

Model-driven apps don't run in the PowerApps mobile app. Instead, you run a model-driven app on a mobile device using either the Dynamics 365 mobile app or in the phone's web browser. 

### Use the mobile app
Install the Dynamics 365 for phones or Dynamics 365 for tablets app from your device’s app store. More information: [Install Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets)

### Run in your phone’s browser
Go to the [Dynamics 365 home page](https://home.dynamics.com) or enter the app URL directly into your phone’s web browser and follow the directions on your screen to load the app. More information: [Run an app in a web browser](run-app-browser.md)
