# Preview: Send email using the enhanced email experience

Send email using the enhanced email experience is an early-access feature. You can opt in early to enable these features in your environment. This will allow you to test these features and then adopt them across your environments. For information on how to enable these features, see [Opt in to 2020 release wave 1 updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates).

The enhanced email experience in model-driven apps allows you to compose an email without leaving the record theyâ€™re working on. With the enhanced email experience, you can:

- Navigate to different pages without losing the email content.
- Minimize the email window to get back to the records you were working on.
- Expand the email editor pop-up window to see more email options.
- Simultaneously open three email compose pop-up windows.
- Search for and apply a predefined template to an email you're composing.
- Insert attachments to email.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - System administrators must enable the enhanced email experience before you can use it.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]  
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_expect_changes](../includes/cc-preview-features-expect-changes.md)]
> - [!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-no-ms-support](../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]

Compose an email using the enhanced experience:

1. In the **Timeline** section of records such as account or contact, select **+** and then under **Activities**, select **Email**.

   A new email pop-up window opens. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enhanced email pop-up window](media/enhanced-email-pop-up.png "Enhanced email pop-up window")

   The **From** and **To** fields are automatically populated based on the user and the account and contact of the original record.

2. Write your email from scratch or select **Insert Template** to search for and apply a template. For more information on inserting an email template, see [Insert an email template](insert-email-template.md).

3. Select **Attach file** if you want to add attachments.

4. Select **Insert signature** to search for and add your signature.

5. When you're done, select **Send**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The enhanced email experience is available only for email activities created from the **Timeline** section of a model-driven app. 
> - The enhanced email pop-up window opens only when the height and width of your screen size is at least 400 x 650 pixels or greater. If lower, you will be taken to the standard form instead of the enhanced email experience.
