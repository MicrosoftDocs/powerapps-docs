# Draft well-written, input text with Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

End users can use Copilot to quickly generate well-written text that can be used as input text in text boxes in canvas apps. Using Copilot saves time for end users as they won’t have to worry about creating well-written text themselves that meets grammar rules. Copilot is especially helpful for end users who are using apps that aren’t in their native language. 

When a user is trying to quickly input text into multi-line text boxes or rich text editors in a canvas app, the user might worry about forming complete sentences and having grammatically correct text. With the assistance of Copilot, a user can quickly jot down their ideas in a text box without worrying about format and grammar. Copilot corrects grammar errors and eloquently refines the user's ideas. The user can also change the tone and length of the output to fit the scenario.
