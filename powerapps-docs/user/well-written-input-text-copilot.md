# Draft well-written input text with Copilot (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Users can use Copilot to quickly generate well-written text that can be used as input text in text boxes in canvas apps. Using Copilot saves time for users as they won’t have to worry about creating well-written text themselves that meets grammar rules. Copilot is especially helpful for users who are using apps that aren’t in their native language. 

When a user is trying to quickly input text into multi-line text boxes or rich text editors in a canvas app, the user might worry about forming complete sentences and having grammatically correct text. With the assistance of Copilot, a user can quickly jot down their ideas in a text box without worrying about format and grammar. Copilot corrects grammar errors and eloquently refines the user's ideas. The user can also change the tone and length of the output to fit the scenario.


## Use this feature

1. Insert your cursor into a multi-line text box or rich text editor in a canvas app.
1. Select the **Draft with Copilot** icon, and then select the **Draft with Copilot** option.
2. Insert text into the text box. For example, you can quickly jot down an idea.

     > [!Note]
     > You must enter the text in English. This feature only supports the English language at this time.
     
4. Select the **Send** icon.
5. Copilot generates well-written text for you. Review the text. The following options are available:
    - If you want Copilot to suggest text that is shorter or longer, select **Length** and then select the appropriate length.
    - If you want Copilot to suggest text that has a different tone, select **Tone** and then select the appropriate tone for the text.
    - If you want Copilot to suggest different text, select **Rewrite**.
    - If you are satisfied with the text that Copilot suggested, select **Add** to enter the text in the text box.
