# Create a new record

## Create a new record using the + option on the command bar

The **Create a new record** command or **Quick create** makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so it’s available whenever you need to enter new information into the system. You can also save a record and create a new one directly from the **Quick create** form.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Quick create** option is only available for records that are enabled by your admin.
    
1. On the navigation bar, select the **plus sign** ![Create record button](media/create-record-button.png "Create record button"), and then select the item you want.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Create record button](media/newrecord1.png "Create record button")
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save and Close**. Or, to save and create another record, select the down arrow and then select  **Save & Create New**.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Save a record](media/quick_create.png "Save a record")
  
> [!NOTE]
> An asterisk ![Required Field button](media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means the field is required. If you select **Save and Close** before entering required fields an error message will be displayed or if you have entered information and select **Cancel** a warning will be displayed.
>   
> A plus sign ![Recommended Field button](media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means your organization recommends that you fill in the field.  


## Create a new record using the New button 

1. From the left navigation pane, select a record type. For example, select **Contacts** to create a new contact record.
2. On the command bar, select **+New**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Create new button](media/newrecord2.png "Create new button")
  
3. Fill in the appropriate details for new contact and then select **Save and Close**.

   > [!NOTE]
    > If you have unsaved changes and try to go to another record or form, a **Unsaved changes** dialog box will pop-up. If you select **Save and continue**, it will attempt to save your information and open the page you wanted to go to. If you choose to save and continue and there is an error on a field, the dialog will close and you will remain on the page to fix the error before you can navigate away.
