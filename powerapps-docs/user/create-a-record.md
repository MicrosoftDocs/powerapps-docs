# Create a new record

## Create a new record using the + option on the command bar

The **Create a new record** command or **Quick create** makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so itâ€™s available whenever you need to enter new information into the system. You can also save a record and create a new one directly from the **Quick create** form.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Quick create** option is only available for records that are enabled by your admin.
    
1. On the navigation bar, select the **plus sign** ![Create a record button](media/create-record-button.png "Create a record button"), and then select the item you want.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Create a record](media/newrecord1.png "Create a record")
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save and Close**. Or, to save and create another record, select the down arrow and then select  **Save & Create New**.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
     > ![Save a record](media/quick_create.png "Save a record")
  
> [!NOTE]
> An asterisk ![Required Field button](media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means the field is required. If you select **Save and Close** before entering required fields an error message will be displayed or if you have entered information and select **Cancel** a warning will be displayed.
>   
> A plus sign ![Recommended Field button](media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means your organization recommends that you fill in the field.  


## Create a new record using the New button 

1. From the left navigation pane, select a record type. For example, select **Contacts** to create a new contact record.
2. On the command bar, select **+New**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Create new button](media/newrecord2.png "Create new button")
  
3. To save your changes, on the command bar, select **Save** or **Save & Close**. The **Save** option is still available on the bottom right corner.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Save option on a record](media/saveoptionalwaysvisible.png "Save option on a record")

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have unsaved changes and try to go to another record or form, a **Unsaved changes** dialog box will pop-up. If you select **Save and continue**, it will attempt to save your information and open the page you wanted to go to. If you choose to save and continue and there is an error on a field, the dialog will close and you will remain on the page to fix the error before you can navigate away.
