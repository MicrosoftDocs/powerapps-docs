# Open your app data in Excel Online 

Open your app data in Excel Online and make quick edits or do an ad-hoc analysis. You can make changes to your app data in Excel Online and then save the updated information back to your app. 

This feature requires that you have an Office 365 subscription or a subscription to an online service such as SharePoint Online or Exchange Online and a Microsoft account. 

A few things to note:

- The data for an *ad-hoc* analysis with Excel Online is stored temporarily. Any additions, such as charts, graphs, calculations, columns, and colors won’t be saved back to the app from the ad-hoc analysis in Excel Online. Keep the existing format of the Excel cells to prevent problems when you save the file. The file import might fail if you make a lot of changes. 
- Updated data in an app isn't immediately reflected in Excel Online if the same view was opened in the last two minutes in Excel Online. After that time frame, any updated data should show in Excel Online.
- The option to open data in Excel Online isn’t available for all tables. If you don’t see the option for a table, then it’s not available for that table.
