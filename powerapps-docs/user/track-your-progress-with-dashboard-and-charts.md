# Track your progress with dashboards and charts

Dashboards take a collection of app data and provide insights to show key performance indicators (KPI) and other important data in easy-to-read interactive charts and graphs. Dashboards are available for all record types.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Dashboard](media/Dashboard.png "Dashboard") 

-  To see a different dashboard layout, select the down arrow next to the name of the dashboard, and then select the layout you want.
-  To choose a default dashboard, display the dashboard you want, and then select **Set as Default** at the top of the screen.

## Create a new dashboard

1. To create a new dashboard, select **Create a Dynamics 365 Dashboard**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add a new dashboard](media/new_dashboard.png "Add a new dashboard")
   
2. Choose a dashboard layout and select **Create**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Create a dashboard](media/create_dashboard.png "Create a dashboard")
 
3. Type in a name for the dashboard. 
4. Add what you want to each area of your dashboard. For example, let's add a chart. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Add a chart](media/add_chart.png "Add a chart")
 
 5. Select the **Record Type** for the chart.
 6. Select a **View** that the data in the chart will display.
 7. Choose the chart and then select **Add**.
 8. Continue adding components to the dashboard and when you are done, select **Save**. 
 
The dashboard that you created will appear in the drop-down menu of available dashboards.

## Use charts 

Charts provide you with a quick view of how you’re tracking to your goals. They’re also interactive, so you can click or tap an area of a chart to get more info.

-   Hover your mouse over the chart to see a tooltip that provides quick information about that area of the chart.
-   Click on the area of a chart to see a grid view with more details about the data in the chart.
-   To expand a chart, select the **Expand Chart**  ![Expand chart view](media/expandviewbutton.png "Expand chart view") button.
-   To view records in the chart or refresh the chart, select ![More commands](media/MoreButton.png "More commands") and then choose an  action: **Refresh** or **View Records**.
     
     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![View of charts in PowerApps](media/ViewOfCharts.png "View of charts in PowerApps")  
       

**Change the chart view**
 
Changing the chart view shows you a different breakdown of your data, such as opportunities opened within a specific time period. You can change a chart view by selecting the View selector on the Grid page.

For example, choose "All Opportunities," then select a different view, and both chart and grid will get refreshed.

## Known issues  
In the chart designer, adding a order by on certain calculated fields are not supported and will cause an error.  The calculated fields causing this are using another calculated fields, a related entity field, or a local field on the entity.
