# Use timeline 

Timeline is a modernized and optimized control that helps provide you with at-a-glance understandability when working with your customers. You can use the timeline to view information that is connected to a row in a table and occurs over time in a single stream. Some information that can be logged into the timeline includes notes and posts, in addition to displaying activities such as emails, appointments, phone calls, and tasks.

Timeline allows you to:
- Access the command bar to perform common actions quickly
- Filter and view important notes, posts, and activities using multiple filter options, and keep the filtered settings across activities
- Quickly view and manage email conversation threads with ease
- Keep detailed customer records by attaching important files and images to posts

![Timeline Browser Overview.](media\timeline-browser-view.png "Timeline Browser Overview")

## Timeline functionality

The timeline section on the table form is intended to centralize access to information and streamline effort to accomplish actions. The following section is an overview of how the timeline functionality works in each section on the table form. 

When enabled by your system administrator, you can use the icons that are displayed on the top-right navigation in the timeline for quick access to do the following actions:

- [Create a timeline row](#create-a-timeline-row)
- [Work with Filters](#work-with-filters)
- [Work with row](#work-with-rows)
- [Explore more commands](#more-commands)
- [Search row](#search-rows-on-timeline)
- [Add attachments](#add-an-attachment-to-a-note-in-timeline)

The timeline dashboard displays only the entities that are configured for the signed-in user. So, what you see on the timeline may differ from what another user sees. The signed-in user sees any rows they've followed if those rows are configured to display on the dashboard. For example, if only email and appointments are configured to display, then the signed-in user only sees email that relates to them, which can be email they've sent, email sent to them, and email they follow. The same would be true for appointments in this scenario. For more information on setting up timeline, see [Set up the timeline control](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control).

> [!Note]
> The Notes feature isn't available from the timeline. 

## Create a timeline row

When enabled by your system administrator, you can use the **Create a timeline record** feature to quickly create appointments, tasks, send emails, and make notes and posts and associate them with other rows.

1. Select **Create a timeline record** icon.<BR><BR>
![Create a timeline row icon.](media\timeline-create-a-record-icon1c.png "Use the Create a timeline row feature") 

2. Select the type of row you want to create from the display options available. <BR><BR>
![Select type of timeline row.](media\timeline-create-a-timeline-record-1f.png "Select the type of timeline row")

For information on timeline row configuration, [Set up the timeline control](../maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md).

## Work with filters

When enabled by your system administrator, the timeline **Filter** further streamlines your productivity by allowing you to customize your experience and view data that's relevant to you.

![Timeline filter functionality.](media\timeline-filter-12b.png "Timeline filter functionality")

Legend:
1. The timeline **Filter** ![Filter.](media\timeline-filter-icon.png "Filter") icon is located in the top-right navigation on the timeline.
2. The filter pane displays when the filter icon is selected.
3. Use the carats to expand or minimize selections.
4. When enabled by your system administrator, row and activity types are displayed in the filter pane. Row and activity types can be filtered by selecting the corresponding box next to the item.
5. The ![Clear all filters.](media\timeline-clear-all-filters-icon.png "Clear all filters") icon removes and clears all filter selections from the filter pane.

### Filter rows on timeline <a name="filter-rows"></a>

Filters are valuable for sorting data. You can easily filter through rows and activity types using multiple options to quickly see what matters to you. The filter is available for the activities, notes, posts, and custom entities that are present in timeline.

### Filter icon display

- When the **Filter** icon displays as a transparent ![Clear Filter icon.](media\timeline-filter-icon.png "Filter"), it means the filter pane is empty and nothing has been applied.

### Save filter settings

You can choose to save your filter settings so that you don't have to set them again each time you work with activities in the timeline.

To save your filter settings, after configuring the filters you want, select the ellipses, and then select **Remember my filters**.

> [!Note]
> If you have a system administrator or basic user role, Remember my filters works by default. If you don't have either of these roles, you must have Create/Read/Write privileges to be added to the msdyn_customcontrolextendedsettings table for the setting to work.

![Remember filters functionality.](media\timeline-remember-filters.png "Remember my filters functionality")

Enabling the threaded email view is done via the timeline configuration in Power Apps. Threaded email views must be done in this setting for the specific table, in the specific form, for each specific timeline.

Threaded email views can be enabled in timeline via two options:

**Option 1:**

You can enable the threaded email view using the **More Commands** ![More Commands.](media\timeline-more-commands-icon.png "More commands") feature, located on the right-hand side of the timeline.

**Enable threaded email through the More Commands option**

Steps:
1. Use the **More commands** ![More commands.](media\timeline-more-commands-icon.png "More commands") icon on timeline that displays a flyout menu.
2. Select **Always show email as conversations** to thread and group all emails in that specific timeline. 

![Enable threaded email view - option 1.](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-4a.PNG "Enable threaded email view - option 1")

**Option 2:**

**Enable threaded email through Personal Options setting**

To enable threaded email via this option, go to the command bar and select **Settings**, then **Personalization Settings**. The **Set Personal Options** dialog box is displayed so you can use the following steps to enable the threaded email view on timeline.

Steps:
1. Select the **Email** tab.

3. Select **OK**.

![Enable threaded email view - option 2.](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-3a.PNG "Enable threaded email view - option 2")

> [!Note]
> The **emails as conversation** view is based on the user's preference. Personal settings are tied to the user, not the form, which means when you enable the threaded email view, the setting is applied to all of your timeline views. 

## Search rows on timeline

When enabled by your system administrator, you can easily search for rows in the timeline. When you search for a phrase in the timeline, it searches in the title, subject of the row, body, or description fields of the row and displays the row for you.

Legend
1. The **Search** bar allows you to quickly find rows using keywords or phrases that the search feature retrieves and displays below the search bar.
2. Keywords that are used are highlighted.

## Work with notes and posts

Notes allow you to record richly formatted information and images for reference, summary, or investigation. You can easily add a mention to another user or a reference to a timeline row. The mention capability is available in timeline only when rich text notes and rich text posts are enabled. 

When you type the **@** symbol, the results you see are matches with the first name, last name, or email address of system users starting with your search string. When you mouse over the profile image, you can view the user's detailed profile card and online presence status. More information: [View the profile card for a contact or user.](profile-cards.md)

## Use timeline highlights powered by generative AI

If timeline highlights are enabled on your app, Copilot creates an AI-generated, bulleted list that populates at the top of the timeline. You can use timeline highlights to quickly get caught up on a record's status. 

The highlights include a record's main activities, such as details about who you or the previous user interacted with, the reported issue, and actions taken to try to resolve the issue. 

You can copy the timeline highlights by selecting **Copy**.

## View a conversation transcript

In the timeline, you can view the transcripts of completed chats you've had in conversation channels. To view these transcripts, you must have prvReadmsdyn_transcript permission. More information: [Roles and permissions](/dynamics365/app-profile-manager/security-roles)

To view a conversation transcript, select the **View more** link in the row for which you want to view the transcript. The row expands and the entire transcript is displayed inline.

![Conversation transcript view.](media\timeline-transcript-view.png "Conversation transcript view")


## View what you've missed in timeline

When you access the timeline after being away, activities that you've missed display at the top of the timeline, denoted with a blue vertical line next to them. You can quickly open the activities or scroll past them.

## Pin or unpin records in timeline

If your administrator has enabled the pin setting and you have write/delete access, you can quickly access records, such as activities, by keeping them at the top of the timeline. Pinning a record eliminates the need to scroll through every record to find the one you need.

> [!Note]
> If you have a system administrator or basic user role, the pin and unpin settings work by default. If you don't have either of these roles, you must have Create/Read/Write privileges to be added to the msdyn_customcontrolextendedsettings table for these settings to work.

By default, you can pin notes. The activities that you can pin depend on how your administrator has set up the feature. More information: [Let users pin and unpin activities to the top of timeline.](../maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md#let-users-pin-and-unpin-activities-to-the-top-of-timeline)

Pin a record by selecting the pin icon next to it. This setting moves it to the top of the timeline in the **Pinned** section, where it can be quickly accessed. The Pinned section also lists the number of records that are pinned. You can pin a maximum of 15 records. Records that are pinned will stay at the top of the timeline for a year unless you unpin them.

![Pin and unpin record view.](media\timeline-pin-unpin-activity.png "Pin and unpin a record view")

To unpin a record, select the pin icon next to it. Unpinning it moves it out of the **Pinned** section and back to where it originally appeared in the list of records in the timeline.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks are a quick way for the user to set, and switch between, different sets of filters. Bookmarks are enabled by default. If necessary, you can disable them from the [Advanced](../maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md#advanced) section.

> [!NOTE]
> Bookmarks feature replaces **Remember my filters** button. Use the steps in the following section to set up your user filters.

### Create a bookmark

1. Open the filter pane, and select the filters that will be associated with the new bookmark. You may have no filters selected.

1. Select the bookmark icon ![Empty bookmark icon](media/add-activities/bookmark-icon.png) in timeline's action bar.

1. Select **Add bookmark**.

1. Enter a bookmark name. Optionally, set it as a [default bookmark](#set-a-default-bookmark).

1. Select **Save**.

Selecting the bookmark icon again will now display a flyout of your created bookmarks. You can apply a bookmark by selecting it from this list, or edit it using the **More options** button on the right side of the bookmark.

If a bookmark is selected, its filters are applied to the timeline, and is indicated by a filled bookmark icon  ![Filled bookmark icon](media/add-activities/filled-bookmark-icon.png) in the action bar. Hover over the icon to see the name of the bookmark, or select the icon. The selected bookmark has a grey background color.

> [!NOTE]
> You can have a maximum of 15 bookmarks.

### Edit a bookmark

Any bookmark can be renamed, updated, or deleted from the **More options** menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Selecting **Delete** directly deletes the bookmark.

![Edit bookmark](media/add-activities/edit-bookmark.png)

Updating a bookmark will change its filters to the currently selected filters.

You may also set this bookmark as a default for the current form or all forms.

### Set a default bookmark

When creating or updating a bookmark, you may select the **Set as default bookmark** checkbox, with the option to apply this change for the current form or globally.

A default bookmark has a star icon ![Star icon](media/add-activities/star-icon.png) next to its name, and is selected automatically when the timeline loads, overriding  any admin filters set for timeline.

> [!NOTE]
> You may set a bookmark as a form default for multiple forms; however, it can't be both a form default and a global default. A form-default bookmark will override a global one.

### Reset to the default view

If a nondefault bookmark is selected, or if other filters are applied, a reset to default button appears in the bookmark flyout. This applies the **default bookmark** to timeline, if one exists, otherwise **clearing all filters**.

![Reset default](media/add-activities/reset-default.png)

### Bookmark filters can't be applied

If a bookmark's filters can't be applied (for example, a bookmark that filters for notes while timeline has notes disabled), then an exclamation mark icon is displayed next to its name.
