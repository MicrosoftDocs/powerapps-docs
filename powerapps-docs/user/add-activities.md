# Use timeline 


Timeline is a control that allows you to view information that is connected to a row in a table and occurs over time in a single stream. Some information that can be logged into the timeline are notes and posts in addition to displaying activities such as emails, appointments, phone calls, and tasks.

Timeline allows you to:
- Access the command bar to perform common actions quickly
- Filter and view important notes, posts, and activities using multiple filter options
- View and manage email conversation threads with ease

![Timeline Browser Overview.](media\timeline-browser-view.png "Timeline Browser Overview")

## Timeline functionality

The timeline section on the table form is intended to centralize access to information and streamline effort to accomplish actions. The following is an overview of how the timeline functionality works in each section on the table form. 

When enabled by your system administrator, you can use the icons that are displayed on the top-right navigation in the timeline for quick access to do the following:

- [Create a timeline row](#create-a-timeline-row)
- [Work with Filters](#work-with-filters)
- [Work with row](#work-with-rows)
- [Explore more commands](#more-commands)
- [Search row](#search-rows-on-timeline)
- [Add attachments](#add-an-attachment-to-a-note-in-timeline)

The timeline dashboard displays only the entities that are configured for the signed-in user. So, what you see on the timeline may differ from what another user will see. The signed-in user will see any rows they've followed if those rows are configured to display on the dashboard. For example, if only email and appointments are configured to display, then the signed-in user will only see email that relates to them, which can be email they've sent, email sent to them, and email they follow. The same would be true for appointments in this scenario. For more information on setting up timeline, see [Set up the timeline control](../maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md).

> [!Note]
> The Notes feature is not available from the timeline. 

## Create a timeline row

When enabled by your system administrator, you can use the **Create a timeline record** feature to quickly create appointments, tasks, send emails, as well as make notes and posts and associate them with other rows. 

1. Select **Create a timeline record** icon.<BR><BR>
![Create a timeline row icon.](media\timeline-create-a-record-icon1c.png "Use the Create a timeline row feature") 

2. Select the type of row you want to create from the display options available. <BR><BR>
![Select type of timeline row.](media\timeline-create-a-timeline-record-1f.png "Select the type of timeline row")

For information on timeline row configuration, [Set up the timeline control](../maker/model-driven-apps/set-up-timeline-control.md).
 

## Work with filters

When enabled by your system administrator, the timeline **Filter** further streamlines your productivity by allowing you to customize your experience and view data relevant to you. 

![Timeline filter functionality.](media\timeline-filter-12b.png "Timeline filter functionality")

Legend:
1. The timeline **Filter** ![Filter.](media\timeline-filter-icon.png "Filter") icon is located in the top-right navigation on the timeline.
2. The filter pane displays when the filter icon is selected.
3. Use the carats to expand or minimize selections.
4. When enabled by your system administrator, row and activity types are displayed in the filter pane. Row and activity types can be filtered by selecting the corresponding box next to the item.
5. The ![Clear all filters.](media\timeline-clear-all-filters-icon.png "Clear all filters") icon removes and clears all filter selections from the filter pane.

### Filter rows on timeline <a name="filter-rows"></a>

Filters are valuable for sorting data. You can easily filter through rows and activity types using multiple options to quickly see what matters to you. The filter is available for the activities, notes, posts, and custom entities that are present in timeline.

### Filter icon display

- When the **Filter** icon displays as a transparent ![Clear Filter icon.](media\timeline-filter-icon.png "Filter"), it means the filter pane is empty and nothing has been applied. 
- When the **Filter** icon displays as dark ![Dark Filter icon.](media\timeline-filter-applied-1.png "Filter icon"), it means filters are applied. 

### Filter options

The following category and sub-category options are available on the filer menu:

| Category              | Sub-category   |

## Work with rows  

When working with rows, you can view key information at a glance or expand rows to view more details. When you hover over a row, actions display that you can use.

### Expand all rows

When enabled by your system administrator, you can view timeline rows quickly in a collapsed format or expand a row to see more details for ease of use.

![Expand all rows functionality.](media\timeline-expand-all-records-1d.png "Expand all rows functionality")

4. The **Always show email as conversations** or **Always show email as individual messages** command is used to enable or disables threaded email views.

## Threaded email views in timeline

Use the threaded email view option to save valuable space when you have emails with multiple replies. This view consolidates email threads when collapsed.

**Collapsed threaded email view**
![Collapsed threaded email view.](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-1a.png "Collapsed threaded email view")

Legend

### Enable threaded email views in timeline

Enabling the threaded email view is done via the timeline configuration in Power Apps. Threaded email views must be done in this setting for the specific entity, in the specific form, for each specific timeline.

Threaded email views can be enabled in timeline via two options:

**Option 1:**

You can enable the threaded email view using the **More Commands** ![More Commands.](media\timeline-more-commands-icon.png "More commands") feature, located on the right-hand side of the timeline.

**Enable threaded email through the More Commands option**

Steps:
1. Use the **More commands** ![More commands.](media\timeline-more-commands-icon.png "More commands") icon on timeline which displays a flyout menu.
2. Select **Always show email as conversations** to thread and group all emails in that specific timeline. 

![Enable threaded email view - option 1.](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-4a.PNG "Enable threaded email view - option 1")

**Option 2:**

**Enable threaded email through Personal Options setting**

To enable threaded email via this option, go to the command bar and select **Settings**, then **Personalization Settings**. This will display the **Set Personal Options** dialog box so you can use  the following steps to enable threaded email view on timeline.

Steps:
1. Select the **Email** tab.
2. Select the **Show emails as conversation on Timeline** check box.
3. Select **OK**.

![Enable threaded email view - option 2.](media\timeline-threaded-email-views-3a.PNG "Enable threaded email view - option 2")

> [!Note]
> The **emails as conversation** view is based on the user's preference. Personal settings are tied to the user, not the form, which means when you enable the threaded email view, the setting is applied to all of your timeline views. 

## Search rows on timeline

When enabled by your system administrator, you can easily search for rows in the timeline. When you search for a phrase in the timeline, it searches in the title, subject of the row, body, or description fields of the row and displays the row for you.

![Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2.](media\timeline-search-records-1a.png "Enable threaded email timeline view - option 2")

Legend
1. The **Search** bar allows you to quickly find rows using keywords or phrases that the search feature will retrieve and display below the search bar.
2. Keywords that are used are highlighted.

## Work with notes and posts

Notes allow you to record richly formatted information and images for reference, summary, or investigation. You can easily add a mention to another user or a reference to a timeline row. The mention capability is available in timeline only when rich text notes and rich text posts are enabled. 

When you type the **@** symbol, the results you see are matches with the first name, last name or email address of system users starting with your search string. When you mouse over the profile image, you can view the user's detailed profile card and online presence status. More information: [View the profile card for a contact or user](profile-cards.md)

When you type the **#** symbol, the results you see are matches with the account and contact name table rows starting with your search string.

### Add a note or post to a row on timeline

When enabled by your system administrator, you can either add a note or a post to a row on timeline. Each note and post has a maximum size limit of 100,000 characters.

You can also enter a note and add it to a row, but you can only add one attachment per note. If note is not enabled by your system administrator, you can't add an attachment. 

**Note display view**

When enabled by your system administrator, the **Note** field is displayed under the **Search** feature on timeline.

![Add a note to a row on timeline.](media\timeline-add-a-note-to-a-record.png "Add a note to a row on timeline")

### Access the command bar to perform actions

When you hover your cursor on or expand an activity, post, or note, the command bar appears in the top-right corner of the row with the specific options that support that activity, such as assigning it to others, adding it to a queue, converting it to a case, liking or replying to a post, editing a note, or deleting an activity. However, not all rows can perform the same actions.
