# View and create email

Dynamics 365 model-driven apps let agents interact with customers through email. Email functionality allows agents to:

- View and respond to emails. 

- Utilize common email toolbar functionality and rich text editor controls. 

- View and insert images inline using drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste functionality. 

- Create email in a pop-up window.  

- Preview templates before applying them. 

## View your email

To view your email:

1. In the model-driven app's sitemap, go to **Service** > **Activities**. 

2. Select the **All Activities** drop-down, and then select **My Received Emails**.
