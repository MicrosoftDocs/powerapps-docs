<!--note from editor: "By using" is called for by the Style Guide, but I think a friendlier title would be "Take notes with OneNote". The Style Guide expressly allows it ("It's OK to use _with_ in marketing contexts and with product and service names.") -->
# Take notes by using OneNote 

Use OneNote to take or review notes, ideas, plans, and research from the **Document Associated Grid** view<!--note from editor: To be parallel with collaborate-using-sharepoint.md.--> of a record in Common Data Service.

Before you can use OneNote, it must be enabled by your system administrator. More information:

-   [Find your administrator or support person](find-admin.md)  

-   [Set up OneNote integration](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/set-up-onenote-integration-in-dynamics-365)  

## Start a new OneNote notebook
<!--note from editor: You don't want to use "a OneNote" as a noun, similar to how you don't use "a PowerPoint" to mean a presentation).-->
1. Open a record and go to the **Document Associated Grid** view. For example, open a contact record.

2. On the open record, select the **Related** tab, and then select **Documents**.
