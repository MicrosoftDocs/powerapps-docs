## Things to consider 

Be aware of the following regarding OneDrive for Business in Common Data Service:

- OneDrive storage folders are created in the user's current Common Data Service language. If the language changes, new folders will be created in the new language. Old folders will remain in the previous language.  

- There might be a delay between when the documents are shared in OneDrive and when they're available to other users.
