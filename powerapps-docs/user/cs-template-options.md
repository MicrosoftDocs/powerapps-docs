# Customize an email template using the template editor

Use the **Editor** tab in the **Email Template** form to create customized email templates. The **Editor** tab has three sections:

- Design canvas
- Toolbox
- Layout section types

## Manage an email template

On the design canvas, you can drag, arrange, enter, and delete content. By default, the canvas contains an empty one-column layout section.

You have a few different ways to add items to your template.

- Drag an element from the Toolbox to the canvas. The blue shade indicates that the element is in a suitable location and may be dropped.

- Select an element in the **Toolbox** or the **Layout section types**. An **add** icon appears on the canvas. Select the icon to add the element.

You can select **Go to the parent** to identify the section or column in which the element is embedded.

### Add a layout section to the template

Drag a layout section from the **Layout section types** box to the canvas.

To modify a layout, select it, and then select **Edit layout**. You can change a layout's spacing, style, background color, and image. You can also change the number of columns in the layout and the width of each column.

To change the appearance of a column, select it, and then select **Edit column**. You can change a column's spacing, style, background color, and image.

### Add an element to the template

You can use the design elements in the **Elements** tab in the Toolbox to customize your email template:

- **Text**: Add text content to your template. Replace the placeholder text with your content. Use the floating toolbar to insert dynamic text or format the content.
    > [!NOTE]
    > When you select the text element, the following capabilities of the rich text editor toolbar aren't supported:
    >  - Personalization. Use the Insert dynamic text editor to personalize content.
    >  - Insert image. Use the image element to add an image to column.
    >  - Tracking for links
    >  - Inserting tables
    >  - Font style and size of the text isn't detected, if you paste formatted content from other sources.

- **Image**: Add an image to your template. Select the image placeholder, and then select **Edit Image** and upload an image or specify an image URL. You can also modify the image's size and alignment.

- **Button**: Add a button to your template. Select the button, and then select **Edit Button** and enter the URL to open when the user selects the button. You can also change the label, label font, color, and appearance of the button.

- **Divider**: Divide the template into bordered sections. Select a divider, and then select **Edit Divider** and change the divider's appearance, color, width, alignment, and spacing.

Use the **General Styles** tab to change the layout's width, font, font size, background, and text color.
