# Using quick find to search for records

## Single-entity quick find

Single-entity quick find is used to find records of only one type. This search option is available from within a view. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Single-entity Quick Find](media/single-quick-find-search-box.png "Single-entity quick find search box") 

## Multiple-entity quick find (categorized search)

Multiple-entity quick find is also known as categorized search. 

1.  To start a categorized search, from the top nav bar, select **Search**.  

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Global Search Button](media/global-search-button.png "Global search")
  
2.  Type your search words in the search box, and then select **Search**. Categorized search returns results grouped by entity types, such as accounts or contacts.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Categorized Search Results](media/categorized-search-results.png "Categorized search results page") 

With categorized search, you can search for records that begin with a specific word or use a wildcard character.
  
- **Begins with**: Results include records that begin with a specific word. For example, if you want to search for "Alpine Ski House," type **alp** in the search box; if you type **ski**, the record won't show up.  
  
- **Wildcard**: For example, *ski or *ski\*. 

  > [!NOTE]
  >  Using a wildcard at the beginning of your quick find (single or multiple-entity) search query might result in slower performance.
  
## Filter categorized search results 
  
-   To filter results by a record type, choose a record type from the **Filter with** list. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Filtering Categorized Search Results](media/filter-categorized-search-results.png "Filtering categorized search results")  

  
-   To search all record types, choose **None** from the **Filter with** list.
