End users can request a Power Apps license from their admin directly in the product.

## Wait for response
After you request a license, you'll see a banner at the top of the page that confirms that your request was sent, and that it might take a few days for your [admin to respond to the request](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests?view=o365-worldwide#approve-or-deny-a-license-request).

If you're using a Power Apps trial, you can continue to use the trial while you wait for your request to be approved.

After your admin has reviewed your request, you'll receive an email notification indicating whether the request was approved or denied.
