 # Edit multiple rows
 
 [!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]
 
You can edit multiple rows in model-driven apps and quickly update several columns of data across multiple rows in a single action. This is useful in scenarios when you need to update the same column for multiple rows.

Columns such as timeline wall, quick view forms, reference panel, and etc. aren't available when you're editing multiple rows.

1. To edit multiple rows, go to view page with the list of rows and select two or more rows.
2. On the command bar, select **Edit**.

The **Edit (number of rows) records** dialog opens with the default form for the table.
