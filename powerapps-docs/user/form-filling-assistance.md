# Copilot assistance for form fill in model-driven apps 

With Copilot assistance for filling forms for model-driven apps, users receive suggestions generated by AI for fields in main forms. This feature makes it easier and faster to enter data. These suggestions are based on the user's usage of the app, what information is already available in the form, and their frequently used data. The suggestions are entirely optional, and don't get saved until the user accepts them.

1. On the navigation pane, select **Environments**, and then select an environment in the list.

## Use form fill assistance 

Copilot assistance for filling forms generates suggestions for text, numeric, choice, and date fields in main forms in model-driven apps. Suggestions are generated only for the tab that is open. They are presented inline in the form.

Suggestions are entirely optional and aren't saved in the app until you accept them. 

To accept a specific suggestion, hover over the field, and then select **Accept**. Alternatively, select the field, and then select the **Enter** key.

To accept all suggestions on the open tab of the form, on the notification bar, select **Accept all**.

To replace a suggestion with a different value, select the field and start typing to overwrite the suggestion. Alternative, select the field, select the **Backspace** or **Delete** key, and then start typing. 

If you have unsaved suggestions in a form and try to navigate away, you get a prompt asking if you want to discard those suggestions. The suggestions are only saved when you accept them. You can continue navigating away or stay on the form to review your pending suggestions. You can also select **Do not show again** to avoid being prompted in the future.
