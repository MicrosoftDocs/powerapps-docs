# Copilot assistance for form fill in model-driven apps 

With Copilot assistance for filling forms for model-driven apps, users receive suggestions generated by AI for fields in main forms. This feature makes it easier and faster to enter data. These suggestions are based on the user’s usage of the app, what information is already available in the form, and their frequently used data. The suggestions are entirely optional, and don't get saved until the user accepts them. 

## Turn on form fill assistance

Copilot assistance is available in English only for all model-driven apps on the web with the [modern, refreshed look](modern-fluent-design.md) enabled. Suggestions are generated for fields in main forms only. Currently supported field types are text, numeric, choice, and date. Fields with column security aren't currently supported.

To turn on form fill assistance, admins must complete the following steps in the Power Platform admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center] (https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.
1. Select **Settings** in the command bar.
1. Select **Product > Features**.
1. In the **AI form fill assistance** section, be sure **Users as the feature becomes available (default)** is selected in the dropdown list. Alternatively, change this value to **All users immediately**.

Copilot assistance for filling forms generates suggestions for text, numeric, choice, and date fields in main forms in model-driven apps. Suggestions are generated only for the tab that is open and are presented inline in the form.

Suggestions are entirely optional, and aren't saved in the app until you accept them. 

To accept a specific suggestion, hover of the field and then select **Accept** or select the field and press the **Enter** key.

To accept all suggestions in the open tab of the form, on the notification bar, select **Accept All**.

To replace a suggestion with a different value, select the field and start typing to overwrite the suggestion. Or, select the field and press the backspace or delete key and then start typing. 

If you have unsaved suggestions in a form and try to navigate away, you get a prompt asking if you want to discard those suggestions. The suggestions are only saved when you accept them. You can continue navigating away or stay on the form to review your pending suggestions. You can also select **Do not show again** to avoid being prompted in the future.
