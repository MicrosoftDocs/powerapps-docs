# Use Copilot's form fill assistance feature in model-driven apps

Copilot provides form fill assistance for model-driven apps. This means that users receive suggestions, generated by AI, for fields in main and quick create forms. Suggestions are provided in three ways:

1. Based on the user's usage of the app, what information is already available in the form, and their frequently used data.
2. Based on the copied text the user provides through the **Smart paste (Preview)** capability.
3. Based on the file contents the user provides through the **Files (Preview)** capability.

This feature makes it easier and faster to enter data in forms. The suggestions are entirely optional, and don't get saved until the user explicitly reviews and accepts them.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This feature is generally available in Dynamics 365 apps.
> - This feature is in production ready preview in Power Apps.
>   - Preview features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Due to high demand, this feature might be unavailable intermittently. If the feature is unavailable, try again later.

## Prerequisites

- Copilot assistance is available for all model-driven apps on the web where the [modern, refreshed look](modern-fluent-design.md) is turned on.
- Requires at least one of the [AI form fill assistance](/power-platform/admin/settings-features#ai-form-fill-assistance) environment feature settings enabled.
- The **Allow form fill assistance** column property is enabled for the column where form fill assistance occurs. More information: [Create and edit columns in Dataverse using Power Apps](../maker/data-platform/create-edit-field-portal.md#view-columns)

## Limitations

- The currently supported field types are text, numeric, choice, and date.
- Fields that have column security aren't currently supported.

Copilot assistance for filling forms generates suggestions for blank form fields in model-driven apps. Suggestions are generated only for the tab that is open. They're presented inline in the form.

You can continue navigating away or stay on the form to review your pending suggestions. You can also select **Do not show again** to avoid being prompted in the future.

### Use smart paste (Preview)

Smart paste (Preview) is a capability can that reason over the form and the text or image copied to your clipboard to suggest what text could be used to fill specific fields, and provides suggestions inline in the form. To use smart paste (Preview):

1. Copy the text or image based on which you would like to fill in the form.
2. You can use the **smart paste** icon in the command bar. Alternatively, ensure no specific fields are selected in the form, and then use the regular paste keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).

To use the smart paste (preview) capability, your admin must enable it. For more information on how to enable smart paste, see [Manage feature settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features).

You can continue to paste directly, without smart paste (Preview), into a specific field by clicking on it first and then pasting.
