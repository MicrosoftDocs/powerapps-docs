# Use Copilot's form fill assistance feature in model-driven apps 

Copilot provides form fill assistance for model-driven apps. This means that users receive suggestions, generated by AI, for fields in main forms. This feature makes it easier and faster to enter data. These suggestions are based on the user's usage of the app, what information is already available in the form, and their frequently used data. The suggestions are entirely optional, and don't get saved until the user accepts them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature is generally available in Dynamics 365 apps.
> - This feature is a preview feature in Power Apps.
>   - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality.
>   - Preview features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Due to high demand, this feature may be unavailable intermittently. If the feature is unavailable, please try again later.

## Turn on form fill assistance

Copilot assistance is available, in English only, for all model-driven apps on the web where the [modern, refreshed look](modern-fluent-design.md) is turned on. Suggestions are generated for fields in main forms only. The currently supported field types are text, numeric, choice, and date. Fields that have column security aren't currently supported.

To turn on form fill assistance, admins must complete the following steps in the Power Platform admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
1. On the navigation pane, select **Environments**, and then select an environment in the list.
1. On the command bar, select **Settings**.
1. Select **Product** \> **Features**.
1. In the **AI form fill assistance** section, in the **Enable this feature for** field, make sure that **Users as the feature becomes available (default)** is selected. Alternatively, change the value to **All users immediately**.

## Use form fill assistance 

Copilot assistance for filling forms generates suggestions for text, numeric, choice, and date fields in main forms in model-driven apps. Suggestions are generated only for the tab that is open. They are presented inline in the form.

:::image type="content" source="media/formfill_suggestions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows form fill suggestions being presented in a form.":::

Suggestions are entirely optional and aren't saved in the app until you accept them. 

To accept a specific suggestion, hover over the field, and then select **Accept**. Alternatively, select the field, and then select the **Enter** key.

:::image type="content" source="media/formfill_acceptone.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a specific form fill suggestion being accepted.":::

To accept all suggestions on the open tab of the form, on the notification bar, select **Accept all**.

:::image type="content" source="media/formfill_acceptall.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows all form fill suggestions being accepted.":::

To replace a suggestion with a different value, select the field and start typing to overwrite the suggestion. Alternatively, select the field, select the **Backspace** or **Delete** key, and then start typing. 

If you have unsaved suggestions in a form and try to navigate away, you get a prompt asking if you want to discard those suggestions. The suggestions are only saved when you accept them. You can continue navigating away or stay on the form to review your pending suggestions. You can also select **Do not show again** to avoid being prompted in the future.
