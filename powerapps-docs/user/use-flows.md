# Use Microsoft Flow to automate processes

Microsoft Flow lets you create automated processes between your favorite apps and services. From within your app, you can run a Flow on one or more records. 

Also, you can open Microsoft Flow from your app to view, edit, or create new flows.  More information: [Get started with Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/getting-started)

## Manage your flows 
Connect with Microsoft Flow from your app to manage your flows.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To manage and run Microsoft Flow from your app, Microsoft Flow must be enabled in System Settings for you organization. More information:  [Flows in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/organization-q-and-a) 
  
1. On the toolbar, select **Flows**.  
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Microsoft Flow menu](media/flow.png "Microsoft Flow menu") 
  
2. The following options appear:  
  
   -   Select **Create a flow** to open a new browser tab and direct you to the Microsoft Flow site. On the Microsoft Flow page, select **Continue** to use an existing template or **X** to close, choose, or create a different one.  
  
   -   Select **See your flows** to open a new browser tab and direct you to the Microsoft Flow site where any flows in the Flow environment are displayed.  
  
   -   Select **Login to flow** to connect with Microsoft Flow and display available flows for you to run. This only appears if you aren’t currently signed in to Microsoft Flow.  
   
    For information about creating a flow, see [Get started with Microsoft Flow](/flow/getting-started)
