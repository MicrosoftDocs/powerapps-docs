# What is relevance search?

Relevance search for model-driven apps helps you quickly find what you're looking for. It delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables in a single list, sorted by relevance. In addition, relevance search delivers the following benefits:

- **Fast and accurate search**: Provides a precise and quick search experience for model-driven apps, and performance that's superior to [categorized search](quick-find.md#multiple-table-quick-find-categorized-search). 

- **Suggested results as you type**: Finds what you're looking for and shows you the top results, as you type.

- **Better matching**: Finds matches to any word in the search term for columns in a table. Provides a better user experience compared to [quick find](quick-find.md) search, where all words in the search term must be found in one column. 

- **Smart**: Finds matches that include inflectional words such as **stream**, **streaming**, or **streamed**. 

- **Search across documents in Microsoft Dataverse**: Includes search results for text in documents that are stored in Dataverse such as PDF, Microsoft Office documents, HTML, XML, ZIP, EML, plain text, and JSON file formats. It also searches text in notes and attachments. 

- **Understanding of underlying data**: Understands data types like **Choice** and **Lookup**, so it can effectively interpret a search query that includes multiple search terms.

- **Operators for advanced search**: Lets you use simple Boolean operators in your search term and craft the query to get the results you want. 

- **Intelligence**: Applies AI technology to interpret natural language such as misspellings, common abbreviations, and synonyms to delivers quality results.
