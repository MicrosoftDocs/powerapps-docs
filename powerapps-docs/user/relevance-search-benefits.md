# What is Dataverse search?

Dataverse search for model-driven apps helps you quickly find what you're looking for. It delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables in a single list, sorted by relevance. In addition, Dataverse search delivers the following benefits:

- **Fast and accurate search**: Provides a precise and quick search experience for model-driven apps, and performance that's superior to [categorized search](quick-find.md#multiple-table-quick-find-categorized-search). 

- **Suggested results as you type**: Finds what you're looking for and shows you the top results, as you type.

- **Better matching**: Finds matches to any word in the search term for columns in a table. Provides a better user experience compared to [quick find](quick-find.md) search, where all words in the search term must be found in one column. 

- **Smart**: Finds matches that include inflectional words such as **stream**, **streaming**, or **streamed**. 

- **Search activities**: Search includeds notes and attachements in activities. 

- **Understanding of underlying data**: Understands data types like **Choice** and **Lookup**, so it can effectively interpret a search query that includes multiple search terms.

- **Operators for advanced search**: Lets you use simple Boolean operators in your search term and craft the query to get the results you want. 

- **Intelligence**: Applies AI technology to interpret natural language such as misspellings, common abbreviations, and synonyms to delivers quality results.
