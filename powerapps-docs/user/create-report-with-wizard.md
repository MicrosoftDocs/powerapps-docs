# Create a report using the Report Wizard


Use the Report Wizard to create reports with charts and tables that allow you to easily analyze your data. 

All reports that are created using the Report Wizard are Fetch-based reports. Note that all reports generated with the Report Wizard print in landscape mode.

## Create a new report

1. From the left navigation pane, select the reports area.  
2. On the command bar select **New**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Create a new report.](media/newreport.png "Create a new report")
  
3. A **Report:New Report** screen will appear. For **Report Type** leave the default selection to, **Report Wizard Report** and select the **Report Wizard** button. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Report wizard.](media/report_wizard.png "Report wizard screen")
  
4. In the next screen, leave the default selections and then select **Next**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Report wizard selections.](media/report_wizard_1.png "Report wizard selections")
   
4. On the **Report Properties** screen, enter a name for the report and then choose the row to include in the report and then select **Next**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Report properties screen.](media/report_wizard_2.png "Report properties screen")
  
5.  On the **Select Rows to Include in the Report** screen choose the filters to determine which rows are included in your report. For example, if you only want to see results for rows modified in the last 60 days, you can set that filter in this screen. If you donâ€™t want the data filtered, select **Clear**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select Rows to Include in the Report*.](media/report_wizard_3.png "Select Rows to Include in the Report")
  
6. On the **Lay out Columns** screen, choose the layout of your report. Select **Click here to add a grouping** and choose how you want your data grouped.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Lay out Columns.](media/report_wizard_4.png "Lay out Columns")

7. Select the **Row type** and the **Column** for the data you want to have grouped in the report. When you are done with your selections, select **OK**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![dd grouping screen.](media/report_wizard_5.png "Add grouping screen")
  
8. Select **Click here to add a column** to columns of data related to the row type you chose in the previous step.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![add grouping screen.](media/report_wizard_6.png "Add grouping screen")

9. On the **Add Column** screen choose the data you want to have displayed for the column and then select **OK**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![add column screen.](media/report_wizard_7.png "Add column screen")
  
10. Repeat the previous step for any additional columns that you want to add. When you are done, on the **Lay Out Columns** screen, select **Next**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![add more column screen.](media/report_wizard_8.png "Add more column screen")
  
11. On the **Format Report** screen choose how to format your report and then select **Next**.
 
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Format report.](media/report_wizard_9.png "Format report screen")

12. Review the summary of your report and select **Next** and then select **Finish**. You can now see this report in the list of report in the system.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![View you report.](media/report_wizard_10.png "View your report")
    
> [!NOTE]
> The reports that are querying notes, may display in HTML-formatted text instead of plain text. This is because the rich-text editor is enabled by default. To workaround this issue, do one of the following:
> - Disable the rich-text editor, for more information see, [Rich text editor control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-richtexteditor.md). When you disable the rich-text editor, new notes that are created will not then have the HTML tags. The existing notes that were created when the rich-text editor was enabled will still show in HTML-formatted text.
> - Update the report definition to support formatted text. For more information, see [Importing HTML into a Report](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/importing-html-into-a-report-report-builder-and-ssrs).
