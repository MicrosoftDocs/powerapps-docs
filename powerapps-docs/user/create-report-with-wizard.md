# Create a report using the Report Wizard


Use the Report Wizard to create reports with charts and tables that allow you to easily analyze your data.

    > ![Create a new report](media/newreport.png "Create a new report")
  
3. A **Report:New Report** screen will appear. For **Report Type** leave the default selection to, **Report Wizard Report** and select the **Report Wizard** button.
