# AI features overview

AI features in apps combine the power of model-driven apps with intelligent automation and assistance. Business users can supervise their team of AI agents doing work on their behalf, spot-checking accuracy, intervening when they get blocked, and handling exceptions. Users also get inline assistance from agents, helping them fill out forms faster, explore data more easily, and understand what changed at a glance. Bringing AI into apps empower users to supervise and interact with agents around business processes for more efficiency and productivity.

## Prerequisites

Copilot must be [enabled for your tenant and environment](../maker/canvas-apps/ai-overview.md#disable-copilot-in-power-apps) and apps must have [new look](modern-fluent-design.md) turned on.

## Agent supervision

Agent feed lets business users easily manage and work with agents directly in their apps. It makes apps a central hub for human-agent collaboration by showing a complete activity feed of what agents have done on their behalf, wherever they are in the app.

- [Supervise agents in app](supervise-agents-with-agent-feed.md)

## Agent assistance

Built-in agents make it easy to enter, explore, and summarize data faster and better.  

**Data entry agent**
- [Get assistance filling forms](form-filling-assistance.md)
- [Smart paste into forms](form-filling-assistance.md#use-smart-paste-preview)
- [Draft richer text](../maker/model-driven-apps/use-copilot-email-assist.md)

**Data exploration agent**
- [Explore data in a view](find-data-with-ai.md)
- [Generate data visuals for a view](visualize-data-in-copilot.md)

**Summary agent**
- [Create custom row summaries](../maker/data-platform/configure-form-row-summary.md#create-a-row-summary)
- [See row summaries in a form and view](record-summaries.md)

**Chat agent**
- [Chat with Copilot](use-copilot-model-driven-apps.md)
- [Customize Copilot chat](../maker/model-driven-apps/customize-copilot-chat.md)

**Custom AI experiences**
- [Use APIs to create custom AI-powered experiences](../developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/bring-intelligence-using-agent-apis.md)
- [Add an agent response control](../maker/model-driven-apps/form-designer-add-configure-agent-response.md)
