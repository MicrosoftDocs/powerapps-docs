# AI features overview

AI features in apps combine model-driven apps with intelligent automation and assistance. Business users can supervise their team of AI agents doing work on their behalf, spot-checking accuracy, intervening when they get blocked, and handle exceptions. Users get inline assistance from agents, fill out forms faster, explore data more easily, and understand what changed at a glance. AI in apps lets users supervise and interact with agents around business processes for more efficiency and productivity.

## Prerequisites

Copilot needs to be [enabled for your tenant and environment](../maker/canvas-apps/ai-overview.md#enable-or-disable-copilot-features), and apps need to have the [new look](modern-fluent-design.md) turned on. AI features also have their own [enablement settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features).

## Agent supervision

Agent feed helps business users manage and work with agents directly in their apps. It makes apps a central hub for human-agent collaboration by showing a complete activity feed of what agents have done on their behalf, wherever they are in the app.

- [Add agents to be supervised in app](../maker/model-driven-apps/add-agents-to-app.md)
- [Supervise agents in app](supervise-agents-with-agent-feed.md)
- [Configure suggested actions in model-driven apps](../maker/model-driven-apps/configure-suggested-actions.md)
- [Use suggested actions in the agent feed](use-suggested-actions-in-the-agent-feed.md)

## Agent assistance

Built-in agents help you enter, explore, and summarize data faster and better.

- [Explore data in a view](find-data-with-ai.md)
- [Generate data visuals for a view](visualize-data-in-copilot.md)

**Summary agent**

- [Create custom row summaries](../maker/data-platform/configure-form-row-summary.md#create-a-row-summary)
