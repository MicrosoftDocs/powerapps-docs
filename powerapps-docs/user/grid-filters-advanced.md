# Create and manage personal views on a grid page (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The grid page in a model-driven app displays data in a view using the read-only grid control. Views are used to define how rows of a table are displayed in an app.

A view definition has the following elements:

- Columns to display, including the order and width
- Default sort order
- Filter conditions to show rows that match the conditions

You can create and manage personal views on a grid page by editing any of these three elements of a view. For more information, see [Understand model-driven app views](../maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views.md).

## Column editor

Use the column editor to add, remove, or reorder columns to help get a clear view of your data. 

1. To edit a column on the grid page, select **Edit columns**.

 > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
 > ![Select the column editor to edit columns.](media/colum-editor.gif "Columns editor")
   
2. The **Edit columns** pane appears and shows the list of columns in the order they appear in the current view. Follow these steps, to edit the columns:

    - To remove columns, select the More commands button (**…**) next to column name and then select, **Remove**. 
    
    - To change the order of the columns, select the More commands button (**…**) next to column name and then select, **Move up** or **Move down**. Or, drag and drop a column to the desired position 

       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
       > ![Edit columns.](media/edit-colums.png "Columns editor")


3. To add columns to the view, select **Add columns**. This brings up the **Add columns** pane that lists all the columns in the table that you can add to the view.
4. By default, you'll see the **Default** set of system columns in the table. Select the drop-down list, see **All** or **Custom** columns to choose from.
5. Use the **Search** to find a specific column.
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Edit and add columns.](media/edit-colums-1.png "Edit and add columns")
   
6. Select a column from the list to append it to the list of columns for the view.
   
7. To add columns from related tables, select the **Related** tab. You'll see the columns from  related table is in parentheses. Browse and expand the list and choose a related table column to add to the view. When you're done, select **Close** to review the list of added columns.
  
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Edit related column filter.](media/edit-related-column-filter.gif "Edit related columns filter")

8. At any point, you can reset the list of columns to the ones in the view definition by choosing the **Reset to default** option. When you have reviewed the changes you made, select **Apply** to see the changes to the view on the grid page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Reset or apply column filters.](media/edit-colums-2.png "Reset or apply column filters")


## Filter editor

Use the filter editor on the grid page to view the set of conditions in the current view. You can also add more or remove conditions from the filtered data.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
>![Select to edit the filters.](media/edit-filters.gif "Edit filters")

1. To remove a condition, select the More commands button (**…**) next to a row and then select, **Delete**.

2. Follow these steps to add a conditions:

   - To add a single condition, select **Add row**. Select a column, an operator, and a value to create a condition.
     
     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Add a row.](media/add-condition.gif "Edit condition")

   - To add a group of conditions, select **Add group**. You can create multiple sub-conditions and group them using AND or OR operators to create an expression.

     ![Add a group condition.](media/add-group-condition.gif "Add group condition")

   - To add condition on a column from a related table select, **Add related entity**. Then choose the related table you want to filter on and add conditions to it.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Add a related entity.](media/add-related-table.png "Add related entity")
    
     > [!NOTE]
     > **Contains data** is the only conditional operator that can be used with a related table in a view filter.

   - You can group conditions by first selecting a condition using the check box and then selecting the More commands button (**…**) next to a row, and then select **Make group**. </br></br>At any point, you can reset the conditional expression back to original state by choosing the **Reset to default** option.


     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Group conditions.](media/group-conditions.png "Group conditions")
   
3. When you have reviewed the changes you made, select **Apply** to see changes to the view data on the grid page.

## Create personal views

When you edit a view definition and haven't save it yet, you'll see asterisk next to the view name indicating the view isn't saved.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Unsaved view.](media/unsaved-view.png "Unsaved view")

To save a view, follow these steps:

- If you made changes to a system view or a personal view that you don't have *Write* permission to, then you can only save the view as a personal view. On the command bar select, the More commands button > **Create view** >, **Save as new view**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Save system view.](media/save-system-view.png "Save system view")

- To save changes to one of your personal views that you have *write* permission to, on the command bar select, the More commands button > **Create view** > **Save changes to current view**. 

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Save personal view.](media/save-personal-view.png "Save personal view")

### Modern advanced find

When your administrator has enabled the [modern advanced find experience](/power-platform/admin/settings-features), then you can create a personal view directly from the view selector.

- If you made changes to a system view or a personal view that you don't have *Write* permission to, then you can only save the view as a personal view. To save the view, select the view selector and then choose, **Save as a new view**.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Save as new view.](media/save-as-new-view.gif "Save as new view")

- To save changes to a personal view that you have *Write* permission to, select the view selector, and then choose **Save changes to current view**. 

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Save changes to current view.](media/save-current-view.gif "Save changes to current view")


## Set default view

Each table in your app has a default view that's set by your administrator. The default view for a table is indicated by the **Default** label in the view selector.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Default view.](media/default-system-view.png "Default view")

To make another view your default view, select the view and then select, **Set current view as my default**. You will only see the **Set current view as my default** option when the view is saved when the selected view isn't already set as the default view.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Set as default view.](media/set-default-view.png "Set as default view")

To reset the default view to the original view set by your administrator, select **Reset default view**.

> [!NOTE]
> - You'll see the **Reset default view** option only when the current default view for the table is not the one set by the system administrator.
> - The options at the bottom of the view selector are always visible, even if the list of views is longer than the available vertical screen space.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Reset to the default view.](media/reset-default-view.png "Reset to the default view")

   
## Manage and share personal views

When your administrator has enabled the [modern advanced find experience](/power-platform/admin/settings-features), then you will see the **Manage and share views** option in the view selector. The **Manage and share views** options lets you share views with your organization and manage your views.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Manage and share views.](media/manage-share-views.png "Manage and share views")


### Change sort order

By default, the list of views in the view selector is grouped by personal views and system views. Both view type are listed in alphabetical order. 

1. To change the sort order, select the view selector and then select, **Manage and share views**. Then choose from one of these sort options:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Manage views.](media/manage-views.gif "Manage views")


    - **Personal before system, A to Z**: This is the default. All personal views are ordered alphabetically and appear above all system views that are also ordered alphabetically.

    - **System before personal, A to Z**: All system views are ordered alphabetically appear above all personal views that are also ordered alphabetically.

    - **A to Z**: All views (system and personal) appear in alphabetic in the view selector.

     > [!NOTE]
     > - Personal views have a user user icon next to the view name: ![Persona view icon.](media/user-icon.png "Personal view icon") 
     > - To see if the view is a personal view or a system view, hover over the info icon: ![Information button.](media/info-icon.png "Information") 

### Hide views

You can hide views from showing in the view selector by using the **Hide** option in the view management panel. Hover over the view and then select **Hide**. You can also select **View commands** and then select **Hide**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Hide views.](media/hide-command.png "Hide views")

#### What is view hiding?

Hiding a view is a way to personalize the view list and reduce clutter by making views not be visible in the view selector. A view may be needed for a specific purpose periodically or a view could be shared with you that you may not need it anymore. In such instances, hiding enables you to manage your view list by seeing only the views that are most important for you.

Once a view is hidden, it will not appear in the view list for that table in all model-driven apps on all devices for you. If a view is shared with you and other team members, hiding that view will only hide the view for you in the view selector; it will not be hidden for everyone else who has access to the view.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - By default personal views can be hidden. You can hide system views only if the administrator has enabled the setting in Power Platform Admin Center.
   > - The default view of a table cannot be hidden.
   > - A view that is hidden cannot be set as default.

If a view is hidden, then you will see the option to make it visible. Hover over the view and then select **Show**. You can also select **View commands** and then select **Show**.
