#  About dialog for model-driven apps 

This article explains the various parts of the **About** dialog for model-driven apps.

:::image type="content" source="media/about-dialog/about-dialog-channel.png" alt-text="About dialog for model-driven apps.":::

- The **Channel** attribute indicates the feature set being used. Admins can set a channel value of **Semi-annual** or **Monthly** in the Power Platform admin center or through code. More information: [Manage behavior settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-behavior)

- The **semi-annual channel** is the current, twice-a-year release wave that is updated in April and October. The release for the semi-annual channel is shown at the top of the dialog like **2023 release wave 1 enabled**.

- The **monthly channel** is the new, release cadence that happens once per month. The release for the monthly channel is shown after **Channel: Monthly** as a month and year. For example, in the screenshot provided, the monthly channel is May 2023.
