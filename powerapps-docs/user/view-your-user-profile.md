# View your user profile  

Your user profile displays useful information about you to your entire organization; for example, your contact information, your organization, and your security role. Depending on your security role, you might be able to make changes to your user profile.  
  
1. In the upper-right corner of the screen, select **Settings** ![user-profile-settings-button](media/user-profile-settings-button.gif) > **Personalization Settings**.  
 
2. Scroll down to the very bottom of the **Set Personal Options** dialog box, and then choose **View your user information**.  
  
3. Select the different areas such as **Summary**, **Details**, or **Administration** to see details about your profile.
