# Email FAQs and known issues

Find answers to common questions regarding the email experience features and functionality, configurations, and other key concepts.

## Email content is lost after entering text in the body of the message

**Issue**: Recent content added to the email may get lost if you enter text in the body of an email and immediately select **Save**, **Save and Close**, or **Send**. 

**Resolution**: To avoid this issue, wait a few seconds before you select **Save**, **Save and Close**, or **Send** after you enter text in the body of the email.

## The From column is read only or lookup isn't working

**Issue**: The **From** column in an email form is read-only or you can't look up rows and filter results by **User** or **Queue**.

**Resolution**: This happens when customization specifically have been applied on this column by your system administrator. To fix the issue, open a browser window and run the following two commands replacing the **environment URL** with the URL of your environment.


 - (replace with your environment URL)/api/data/v9.1/RemoveActiveCustomizations(SolutionComponentName='AttributeLookupValue',ComponentId=(25E9AF0C-2341-DB11-898A-0007E9E17EBD))
 - (replace with your environment URL)/api/data/v9.1/RemoveActiveCustomizations(SolutionComponentName='AttributeLookupValue',ComponentId=(26E9AF0C-2341-DB11-898A-0007E9E17EBD))
 
To find the URL, in the address bar the first part of the URL that starts with **https://** and ends with **.com** is your environment URL. For more information on how to find the environment URL, see [Get the environment UR](/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup-powerbi#get-the-environment-url).
