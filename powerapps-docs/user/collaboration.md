# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Collaborate with colleagues and share links in model-driven Power Apps the same way do you as in Microsoft Office.

> [!NOTE]
> - This is currently a preview feature. Your system administrator needs to turn on the **Collaboration** feature in your environment. For information, see [Manage feature settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features).
> - During the preview period, these features are only available in the **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact**, and **Case** tables that are in customer engagement apps such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub) or stand-alone Power Apps.


### Multiplayer apps
When you're working on a record such as an **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact**, or **Case** you can also see other users that are working on the same record.

You can also select a user's picture to see their online status, send them an email, or start a Teams chat.

### View a user's status and picture

App users, such as the record owner, are displayed with their picture and online status.
