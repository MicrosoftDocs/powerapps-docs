# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps 

Collaborate with colleagues and share links in model-driven Power Apps the same way do you as in Microsoft Office.


### Multiplayer apps (preview)
[This section is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

When you're working on a record such as an **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact**, or **Case** you can also see other users that are working on the same record.

You can also select a user's picture to see their online status, send them an email, or start a Teams chat.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![View a user's online status.](media/collob-1.png "View a user's online status")

> [!NOTE]
> - This is currently a preview feature. Your system administrator needs to turn on the **Copresence** feature in your environment. For information, see [Manage feature settings](/power-platform/admin/settings-features).
> - During the preview period, these features are only available in the **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact**, and **Case** tables that are in customer engagement apps such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub), or stand-alone Power Apps.

### View a user's status and picture

App users, such as the record owner, as well as the users appearing in grids and lookups are displayed with their picture and online status.  This feature is now available on all model-driven apps and cannot be disabled.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![VView a user's online status.](media/collob-2.png "View a user's online status.")

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will be extended to user lookups and grid user columns. 


### Share 

Easy sharing of direct links with others will be enabled during the preview period.
