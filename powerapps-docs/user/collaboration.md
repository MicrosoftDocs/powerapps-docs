# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Collaborate and share information in model-driven Power Apps the same way as you do other Microsoft Office apps.

When you're working on a row such as an **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** or **Case** you can also see other users that are working on the same row. Select a user's picture to see their online status, send an email, or start a Teams chat.
