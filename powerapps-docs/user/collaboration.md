# Collaborate with others in model-driven apps (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Collaborate and share information in model-driven Power Apps the same way as you do other Microsoft Office apps.

When you're working on a record such as an **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** or **Case** you can also see other users that are working on the same record.

You can also select a user's picture to see their online status, send them an email, or start a Teams chat.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is only available in the **Opportunity**, **Account**, **Contact** and **Case** tables that are in customer engagement apps such as [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales-professional/help-hub.md), [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/help-hub.md).

### View a user's status and picture

When you open a row that's owned by another user their picture and online status is displayed.

### Sharing 

Easily share the direct link to a row, by selecting **Share** in command bar. Select **Copy link** and then paste it in another app to share the link. 
The user's that you share the link with will have read only permission to the row.
