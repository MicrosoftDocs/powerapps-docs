# Work with reports

Reports help you monitor your progress towards your business goals by helping you see how youâ€™re doing. You can also track trends - which can give you an advantage over your competitors.  

For more information on organizing and creating reports, see: [Customize and organize reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-reporting-to-app).
  
## Run a report

2. Choose the report you want > **Run Report**.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  In **Report Viewer** dialog box, you can leave the search criteria as is, or change it as needed.
