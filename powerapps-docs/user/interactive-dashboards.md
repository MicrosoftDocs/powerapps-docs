# Use interactive dashboards to filter data

Use interactive dashboards to filter and view your app data. Charts on a interactive dashboard serves as a simple filtering source. You can select different data points on a chart to filter data based on the filter criteria. 
Interactive dashboards are system dashboards that only an admin can create. To learn more on how to create and configure interactive dashboards, see [Create and configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/configure-interactive-experience-dashboards).

Interactive dashboards come in two forms: multi-stream and single-stream. In addition, multi-stream dashboards can be home page or entity-specific dashboards. The multi-stream dashboards display data in real time over multiple data streams.

> ![Multi-stream interactive dashboard](media/interactive_dashboard.png "Multi-stream interactive dashboard") 


The single-stream dashboards display real-time data over one stream based on an entity view. Visual filters are already applied and the tiles are positioned on the right side of the dashboards and are always shown.

 ## Use visual filters
 
 Use the visual filter option to drill-down in to the data on the charts. This displays information that interests you most.

 1. To view a interactive dashboard, in the list of dashboards find the one that has the interactive icon ![Interactive dashboard icon](media/interactive_dashboard_icon.png "Interactive dashboard icon") next the dashboard name.

3. Select a drill-down option.

4. Select an area one of the chart or graph to apply a filter. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select an area on a chart](media/select_chart_area.png "Select an area on a chart")
  
5. To clear filter, select the **X** next to the filter or to clear all filters, select **Clear All**.
