# Create, edit, or save an Advanced Find search

Find the records you want in your app by using the Advanced Find search option. You can also use Advanced Find to prepare data for export to Office Excel so that you analyze, summarize, or aggregate data, or create PivotTables to view your data from different perspectives.  
  
1. On the command bar, select the **Advanced Find** button.
  
2. Specify what to search for.  
  
   1.  In the **Look for** list, select a record type.  
  
   2.  Choose **Select** to define search criteria: field (for example, Account Name or City), the query relational operator (part of an expression such as "is equal to" or "contains" that defines how a specified attribute should be compared with a value.), and the values to locate (for example, "Seattle" or "Email").  
  
       You can select fields from the current record type, or from related records. For example, an account might have many related contact records.  
  
       At the bottom of the **Select** list, the **Related** section shows related record types. For example, most record types have a related Notes record type. To select fields from a related record type, select field and a new **Select** link appears.  

3. Specify the columns to include in the search results.  
  
   1.  Select **Edit Columns**, and then select **Add Columns**.  
  
   2.  Select the record type that includes the columns you want to add.  
  
   3.  Select the columns you want to add, and then select **OK**.  
  
4. Specify the sort order.  
  
   1.  Select **Edit Columns**.  
  
   2.  Select **Configure Sorting**.  
  
   3.  Specify the column to sort on, specify the sort order, and then select **OK**.  
  
   4.  Select **OK**.  
  
5. Select **Results**.

To save the results, select **Save As** and name the personalized view.
