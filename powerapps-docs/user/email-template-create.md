# Create email templates

Email templates are a fast and easy way to send consistent, professional, preformatted email messages to your customers. To create email templates, the legacy email template editor is available by default. However, the enhanced email template editor is displayed as a choice if it is enabled by your administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> The enhanced email template editor option is enabled out of the box as an early access feature in  Dynamics 365 Customer Service. 

You can create email templates by using one of the following options:  
- **Start with a blank template**: Create a template from scratch. The editor that's displayed depends on wether the enhanced email template editor option is enabled.
- **Start with an existing template** : Create a template by choosing an existing template. The editor that's displayed depends on the editor in which the existing template was created.

## Start with a blank template

When you start with a blank template, nothing is provided for you. You must add everything you want customers to see. 

1. On the **Email Templates** command bar, select **New**, and then select **Start with a blank template**.

3. Enter the following details:
   - **Template name**: Give your email template a detailed name to help you identify it later.
   - **Permission level**: Select **Organization** to share your template with others or **Individual** for personal use.
   - **Category**: The default value is **User**. Categories determine which dynamic text fields are available for use in your template.
   - **Language**: Display installed language packs. **Language** also helps to categorize your templates.
   - **Create**: Opens one of two editors where you can build your template.
 
       :::image type="content" source="media/email-create-an-email-template-1a.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows blank template page."::: 
 
3. Select **Create**. The template editor is displayed.

The editor page you see depends on whether your administrator has turned on the enhanced email template editor option:

- If yes, you'll use the enhanced email template editor page.
- If not, you'll use the email template editor page. 

## Start with existing templates

Start with an existing template to create an email template faster and with less effort. The template is pre-populated with data. All you need to do is customize it for your needs.

1. On the **Email Templates** command bar, select **New**, and then select **Start with existing templates**.
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Search**: Search for the name of a template to start from. Search doesn't support regular expressions.
   - **Browse** out-of-the-box templates, global and entity-specific, listed in alphabetical order. Global templates are shown as the type User. If you've created custom email templates, they're also listed.
   - **Details**. Preview the templates so that you can pick the one that best meets your needs. You can modify it as needed later.
  
       :::image type="content" source="media/email-start-with-existing-templates-1a.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows existing email templates to start from.":::
  
3. The template editor page is displayed.

When you create a template from an existing template, irrespective of the enhanced email template editor option setting, the app displays the newly-created email template in one of the following template editors:
  - Enhanced email template: If the selected email template was created with the enhanced email template.
  - Email template: If the selected template was created with the legacy email template.

> [!Important]
> If you create templates in the enhanced editing environment, don't edit them in the legacy web client. You'll lose any inline images and strip out some of the advanced formatting and functionality.

### Work with existing templates
