# Create email templates

Email templates are a fast and easy way to send consistent, professional, preformatted email messages to your customers. To create email templates, the legacy email template editor is available by default. However, the enhanced email template editor is displayed as a choice if it is enabled by your administrator.

You can create email templates by using one of the following options:  
- **Start with a blank template**: Create a template from scratch. The editor that's displayed depends on wether the enhanced email template editor option is enabled.
- **Start with an existing template** : Create a template by choosing an existing template. The editor that's displayed depends on the editor in which the existing template was created.

## Prerequisites

When you need to create an email template based on a table, make sure that you have the necessary permissions on the related tables, such as the Account table for the email template based on a case.
 
## Start with a blank template

When you start with a blank template, nothing is provided for you. You must add everything you want customers to see. 

1. On the **Email Templates** command bar, select **New**, and then select **Start with a blank template**.

3. Enter the following details:
   - **Template name**: Give your email template a detailed name to help you identify it later.
   - **Permission level**: Select from **Organization** or **Individual**. More information: [Permission level for email templates](#permission-level-for-email-templates)
   - **Category**: The default value is **User**. Categories determine which dynamic text fields are available for use in your template.
   - **Language**: Display installed language packs. **Language** also helps to categorize your templates.
   - **Create**: Opens one of two editors where you can build your template.
 
       :::image type="content" source="media/email-create-an-email-template-1a.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows blank template page."::: 
 
3. Select **Create**. The template editor is displayed.

The editor page you see depends on whether your administrator has turned on the enhanced email template editor option:

- If yes, you'll use the enhanced email template editor page.
- If not, you'll use the email template editor page. 

### Permission level for email templates

Selecting **Organization** permission level for email templates allows you to create templates that everyone in the organization can use. **Individual** permission level is for personal use.

> [!NOTE]
> For **Individual** permission templates, these templates do not show up on the list of email templates unless your are the owner of the templates or the owner has shared the template with you.
> 
> For **Organization** permission templates, these templates show up for all users in the organization.

## Start with existing templates

Start with an existing template to create an email template faster and with less effort. The template is pre-populated with data. All you need to do is customize it for your needs.

1. On the **Email Templates** command bar, select **New**, and then select **Start with existing templates**.
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Search**: Search for the name of a template to start from. Search doesn't support regular expressions.
   - **Browse** out-of-the-box templates, global and entity-specific, listed in alphabetical order. Global templates are shown as the type User. If you've created custom email templates, they're also listed.
   - **Details**. Preview the templates so that you can pick the one that best meets your needs. You can modify it as needed later.
  
       :::image type="content" source="media/email-start-with-existing-templates-1a.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows existing email templates to start from.":::
  
3. The template editor page is displayed.

When you create a template from an existing template, irrespective of the enhanced email template editor option setting, the app displays the newly-created email template in one of the following template editors:
  - Enhanced email template: If the selected email template was created with the enhanced email template.
  - Email template: If the selected template was created with the legacy email template.

> [!Important]
> If you create templates in the enhanced editing environment, don't edit them in the legacy web client. You'll lose any inline images and strip out some of the advanced formatting and functionality.
