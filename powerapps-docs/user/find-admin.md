# Find your administrator or support person 

You may occasionally run across issues that require consultation with your administrator. If you donâ€™t know who your administrator is, you can use Advanced Find to find your administrator.  
  
1. Open your app.  
  
2. On the command bar select the **Advanced Find** button.
  
3. On the Advanced Find page, in the **Look for** list, select **Users**.  
  
4. Point to **Select**, and then select **Security Roles** from the list.  
  
5. Under **Columns**, select **Names**.  
  
6. Enter **System Administrator** in the box that says **Enter Text**. At this point, your screen should look like this:  
     
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Advanced Find dialog box](media/find-admnistrator-advanced-find-complete.png "Advanced Find dialog box")  
  
7. Choose the **Results** button on the ribbon.  
  
   You should see a list of one or more system administrators.
