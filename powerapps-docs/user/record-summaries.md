# Use row summaries in model-driven apps

The **Row summary** feature in model-driven apps provides users with a concise, AI-generated overview of key details about a record. Summaries help users quickly understand essential information without manually scanning fields, related records, or activity timelines. You see summaries as a paragraph or bullet points, so they're easy to read.

Summaries can be accessed in two ways:

- From the **Insights** bar at the top of main forms. 
- From view pages by selecting the inline **Summary** action in the grid, which opens the summary for a record in a modal popup.

The feature enhances user efficiency by delivering context-rich insights directly within the form. Users can interact with summaries to copy content, regenerate updated information, and provide feedback on their relevance, improving both usability and accuracy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature is in public preview for Dynamics 365 apps.
>   - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and might have restricted functionality.
>   - Preview features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Prerequisite

Copilot assistance is available for all model-driven apps where the [AI insight cards](/power-platform/admin/settings-features#ai-insight-cards-preview) toggle is turned on. 

## Limitations

Summaries are only currently supported in the English language.

## Feature details

### Accessing record summaries

View the record summary from a form or a view when a [table is configured to display summaries](../maker/data-platform/configure-form-row-summary.md#create-a-row-summary).

- **Forms**: When viewing a record in a main form, the summary appears in the insights bar at the top of the main form.

> [!NOTE]
> You see the record summary after you save a new record. If you haven't saved the record, the summary area stays hidden.

- **Views**: When browsing records in a view, select the inline Summary action next to a record to open the summary in a modal popup.

### Interacting with summaries 

Here are some actions you can take with summaries:

- **Copy**: Select to copy the summary content directly to your clipboard for easy sharing or documentation. 
- **Feedback**: Use the thumbs up or thumbs down icons to rate the summary's usefulness. Your feedback helps improve future summaries so they better meet your expectations and needs.
- **Refresh** (forms only): Select the **Refresh** button to regenerate the summary so it reflects the latest updates to the record.
- **Expand/Collapse** (forms only): In forms, the insights bar is collapsed by default and shows a one-line peek of the summary. Expand the insights bar to see more details.
