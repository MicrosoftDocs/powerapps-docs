# Use record summaries in model-driven apps
The **Record summary** feature in model-driven apps provides users with a concise, AI-generated overview of key details about a record. Displayed within the **AI assistance** area at the top of main forms, the summary helps users quickly understand essential information without manually scanning through fields, related records, or activity timelines. Summaries are presented in either a paragraph or bullet point format, ensuring clarity and ease of consumption.

The feature enhances user efficiency by delivering context-rich insights directly within the form. Users can interact with summaries to copy content, regenerate updated information, and provide feedback on their relevance, improving both usability and accuracy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This feature is in public preview for Dynamics 365 apps.
>   - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality.
>   - Preview features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Prerequisite
Copilot assistance is available for all model-driven apps where the [AI insight cards](/power-platform/admin/settings-features#ai-insight-cards-preview) toggle is turned on. 

## Limitations
Summaries are only currently supported in the English language.

## Feature details

### Viewing the record summary
- When a [table has been configured to display summaries](../../maker/data-platform/configure-form-row-summary#create-a-row-summary), the record summary will appear in the **AI assistance** area at the top of the main form.
- The summary content is dynamically generated and presented in a clear paragraph or bullet point format, emphasizing key details about the record.

> [!NOTE]
> Record summaries only appear after a new record has been successfully saved. For unsaved records, the summary area remains hidden.

### Expanding and collapsing the summary
- Users can **expand** or **collapse** the summary section as needed. The system remembers the expanded/collapsed state for each user across sessions per device, ensuring a consistent experience when revisiting records.
- Summaries are currently expanded by default.

### Providing feedback
