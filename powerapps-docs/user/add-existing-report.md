# Add a report from outside PowerApps

If you’ve created a custom report outside of the system, you can easily add it to PowerApps.

For information about how to create a custom report, see [Reporting and Analytics Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/analytics/get-started-writing-reports).

   **Add a file created in another application**  
  
   1. In the **Source** section, in the **Report Type** box, select **Existing File**.  
   
     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Add a existing report](media/add_existing_report.png "Add a existing report")
  
   2. In the **File Location** box, enter the path and file name of the file to add, or choose **Browse** to locate the file. 
   
      You can can upload many other file types such as an excel file but for this to run like a SQL Server Reporting Services report or Report Wizard created report, the file needs to be an .RDL file. For more information, see [Report writing environment using SQL Server Data Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/analytics/report-writing-environment-using-sql-server-data-tools).

3. Specify the properties for the report.
  
   1.  In the **Details** section, specify a meaningful name and description for the report.  
  
   2.  The **Parent Report** text box displays the parent report of the current report, if one exists.  
  
   3. **Categories**. Choose the **Select or change the values for this field** ![Ellipsis button](media/ellipsis-button.png "Ellipsis button") button, and then specify the categories to include in this report.  
  
   4. **Related Record Types**. To have the report appear in the Reports list on a page for specific record types, choose the **Select or change the values for this field** ![Ellipsis button](media/ellipsis-button.png "Ellipsis button") button, and then select record types.  
  
   5. **Display In**. To specify where reports should be visible, choose the **Select or change the values for this field** ![Ellipsis button](media/ellipsis-button.png "Ellipsis button") button, and then select one or more of the options.  
  
        If no values are selected, the report won’t be visible to end users.  
  
4. Choose **Save** or **Save and Close**.
