# Configure mobile offline profiles for files and images

To work with file and image columns in offline mode, you need to add them to your mobile offline profile.

This article helps you configure a mobile offline profile that has a table with a column where **Data type** is set to **File** or **Image**.

## View column properties for a file or image

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the navigation menu, select **Tables**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)] 

1. Select the table that has the columns you want to view.

1. Under **Schema**, select **Columns**.
  
1. Select the **Display name** of a column where **Data type** is set to **File** or **Image**.

1. The column properties show the **Data type**. Expand **Advanced options** to view the maximum size for a file or image. For more information about columns, see [Columns overview](../maker/data-platform/fields-overview.md).
