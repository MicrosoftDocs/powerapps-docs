## Sign in


Open Power Apps on your mobile device, and sign in by using your Azure Active Directory credentials.

If you have the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on your mobile device, enter your username when prompted, and then approve the notification sent to your device. If you run into issues signing in, see [Troubleshoot issues for Power Apps mobile app](powerapps-mobile-troubleshoot.md).

![Sign in to Power Apps.](media/powerapps_mobile_app_signin_screen.png "Sign in to Power Apps")
  
  
## Find the app
  
When you create an app, or someone shares an app with you&mdash;either a [canvas app](../maker/index.md#canvas-apps) or [model-driven](../maker/index.md#model-driven-apps) app&mdash;you can run that app on Power Apps mobile. 
   
> [!NOTE]
> To see a model-driven app in the list of apps on Power Apps mobile, you need to have a [predefined security role](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles) in the environment that the app is in. If a predefined security role is assigned to a user using a Dataverse team, you need to use an Azure Active Directory (AAD) group team. Users will not see model-driven apps if a predefined security role is assigned using a Dataverse owner team.

### Use Siri shortcuts to add a shortcut to the Home screen (iOS 14 or later) 

The Power Apps mobile app is now integrated with Siri shortcuts, which gives you the ability to add a shortcut to the Home screen, launch apps with Siri, and create new workflows. For more information on how shortcuts work on iOS, see [Shortcuts User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios). This feature requires Power Apps mobile version 3.20092.x or later.

Users on iOS 14 or later can use Siri Shortcuts to pin an app to the home screen. The new experience works for both model-driven and canvas apps. When you add a Siri shortcut, the app is added to the iOS **Shortcuts** app and from there you can add the app to your home screen.


1. On the app that you want add a shortcut for, swipe to the right and select **Shortcut**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select shortcut.](media/add-shortcut-iphone.png "Select shortcut") 
   
3. Add a custom phrase to open the app using voice commands and then select **Add to Siri**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   >![Select Add to Siri.](media/add-shortcut-1.png "Select Add to Siri")

   
4. The app is added to the **Shortcuts** app on your mobile device. Open the **Shortcuts** app and select the ellipsis (...) above the app name.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select the ellipsis to add a shortcut.](media/add-short-2.png "Select the ellipsis] to add shortcut")


5. Select **Add to Home Screen**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Add to Home Screen.](media/add-to-homescreen.png "Select Add to Home Screen")
   
6. On the upper right corner, select **Add** and then select **Done**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   >![Select Add.](media/add-shortcut-3.png "Select Add")
   

7. Go to your home screen to find the pinned app.   
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![App shortcut on home screen.](media/add-shortcut-4.png "App shortcut on home screen")


You can customize the shortcut icon but it is limited to the customization options in iOS. For more information, go to [Modify shortcut icons](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/modify-shortcut-icons-apd5ad5a2128/ios).

#### Close a canvas app
