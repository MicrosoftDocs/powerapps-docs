# Optimize for devices overview (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

_Optimize for devices_ is a feature that changes the way canvas app screens are loaded and displayed for Android and iOS devices that use native UI. This feature lets makers build stunning native apps for mobile users with device-optimized screens that use native UI elements instead of rendering inside of web view. This feature provides the following benefits:

- Brings modern mobile user experiences and interaction patterns
- Improves performance and reliability
- Integrates device capabilities with maker-defined UI

There's no need to rebuild apps as makers can use all the familiar app building elements to create device-optimized experiences, though there are some limitations around which [controls are supported natively today](./optimize-for-devices-controls.md). Apps that are optimized for devices work with other mobile features like [offline](./canvas-mobile-offline-overview.md), [push notifications](./power-apps-mobile-notification.md), and [wrap](../maker/common/wrap/overview.md).

## How screens are optimized for devices

For a canvas app running on Power Apps mobile, there are UI elements, their current state, and the related business logic. For example, on a screen you might have a button at position 0 with a width and height of 200 and 40 respectively and with fill color blue. The business logic, with Power Fx, lets you navigate the user to a different screen.

If 'optimize for devices' is off for that screen, the screen loads and displays in a web view, running similarly to how it would in a desktop's web browser. When optimized for devices is on, each element's current state is passed over to the device where it renders that same element, but using native UI. So now we have a natively rendered, long blue button in the upper-left corner. Business logic modifies state or takes actions, which run the same way it did before. When the natively rendered button is selected, the device runs Power Fx and the user is navigated to the specified screen.

Each [control needs a device-optimized](./optimize-for-devices-controls.md), native equivalent that supports the same properties so it can render the way a maker expects. During preview, there are some [limitations](optimize-for-devices-controls.md#known-limitations) to which controls and properties are supported. Whether a control is classic or modern, it filters the list of controls for device-optimized ones.

## Enable screens to be device-optimized

There are two steps to enabling a screen to be optimized for devices.

1. The **Optimize for devices** experimental app setting must be turned on.

    The setting can be found in the **Settings** > **Upcoming features** > **Experimental** tab. Turning on the **Optimize for devices** app setting shows the **Optimize for devices** property on screens.

2. On each screen, the **Optimize for devices** property must be set to **On**.

    A maker can open the tree view in the navigation pane and select a screen where the **Optimize for devices** property is located. By setting this property to **On**, the screen is rendered natively when running on Power Apps mobile in iOS and Android devices.
