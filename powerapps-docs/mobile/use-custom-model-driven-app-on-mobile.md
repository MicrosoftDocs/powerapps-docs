# User guide for model-driven apps running on Power Apps mobile

Use Power Apps mobile to run model-driven apps on your mobile device. For more information about how to install and get started with an app, see [Run model-driven apps and canvas apps on Power Apps mobile](run-powerapps-on-mobile.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Model-driven apps for Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Dynamics 365 Field Service don't run in Power Apps mobile. Instead, you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app. For more information, see [User Guide for Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](/dynamics365/mobile-app/user-guide-mobile-app).

## Home screen 

It's easy to get around in Power Apps mobile. The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements on the Home screen. 

![Navigation controls, expanded view.](media/home_screen_iphone.png "Navigation controls, expanded view")

Legend:

1. **Site map**: Open the menu and move between apps, get to your favorite and recently used rows, access settings, and more.
2. **Search**: Search for app rows in Microsoft Dataverse.
3. **New**: Create a new row and quickly enter almost any type of information into the system.
4. **Assistant**: Use the assistant to monitor and track daily actions and communications. It helps you stay on top of your day with insight cards that are displayed prominently throughout the app to provide tailored and actionable insights.

## Site map 

From the Home screen, select the site map ![Site map icon.](media/pa_mobile_sitemap_icon.png "Site map icon") to access tables, favorite or most-used rows, other apps, and settings.

If you're on [early access](/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates) your site map might look different. With 2021 release wave 2, the app maker can customize the navigation bar and show or hide the **Home**, **Recent**, **Pinned** buttons in the site map. The app maker can also make groups collapsible. For more information, see [Hide or show the Home, Pinned, Recent, and collapsible groups](../user/navigation.md#early-access-hide-or-show-the-home-pinned-recent-and-collapsible-groups).
