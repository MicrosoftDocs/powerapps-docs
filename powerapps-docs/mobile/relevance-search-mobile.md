# Use relevance search for model-driven apps using Power Apps Mobile 


You can quickly find the information that you're looking for by using relevance search. The relevance search experience delivers fast and comprehensive results across multiple tables, in a single list, sorted by relevance.

Relevance search is already available when you're using a model-driven app in a web browser. The functionality is the same in Power Apps Mobile, but it works a little differently. More information: [Search for tables and rows by using relevance search](../user/relevance-search.md)

Before you begin using relevance search, the new experience needs to be enabled by the administrator for your organization. More information: [Enable the new relevance search experience](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization#enable-the-new-relevance-search-experience)<!--note from editor: Edit to alt text suggested. This isn't really a "diagram," which is a line drawing such as a conceptual illustration.-->

  2. **Top results**: This tab shows the rows that best match the search query. 
  3. **Table-specific tab**: To narrow your search results to a specific table, select the table tab.
  4. **Filter**: Refine the search results by using filters. When you select filters, the number of tables that have been filtered on appears next to the filter option.

## Filter search results
  
Use filters to drill into and explore the results of your current search without having to repeatedly refine your search terms. Immediately after you perform a search, you can filter by **Owner**, **Created On**, or **Modified On**.
