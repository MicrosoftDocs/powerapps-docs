# Switch to a different tenant in the Power Apps mobile app

Users can now easily switch to a different tenant, without having to log out of Power Apps, when using Power Apps on mobile devices. Users can specify the tenant they want to work in on the user profile page.  This means that:

- Users no longer need to sign out of Power Apps to switch tenants.
- Users can now access shared apps from a list on the user profile page.

> [!Important]
> The ability to easily switch to a different tenant is available on only Android devices at this time.

To switch to a different tenant on Power Apps mobile:

1. Open Power Apps on your mobile device.
2. From the **Home**, **All apps**, or **More** page, select your profile image. Your user profile page appears.
3. Select the tenant you're signed in to. A list of tenants appears.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![A list of tenants.](media/tenant-switcher.png "A list of tenants.")
   
4. Select the tenant you want to switch to.
