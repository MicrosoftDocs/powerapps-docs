# In-app notifications in the Power Apps mobile app


In-app notifications allow users to receive notifications in the notification center and as a notification toast. For more information, see [In-app notifications in model-driven apps](../user/notifications.md). In Power Apps mobile, toast notifications appear one at a time.
