# Set up mobile offline for canvas apps


Turn on offline mode in your canvas app if users need to work without worrying about their Internet connection.

## Prerequisites

- You must have the Environment Maker, System Administrator, or System Customizer role to set up offline mode for canvas apps. These roles have create, read, write, delete, and share privileges on **Canvas App**, **Mobile offline profile**, and **Sync Error** tables. [Learn about predefined security roles](../maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app.md#about-predefined-security-roles).

- Users with the Basic User role can't open an offline application. You must create a custom security role with read privileges on **Canvas App**, **Mobile offline profile**, and **Sync Error** tables.

- If you already have a custom security role, make sure it grants read privileges on **Canvas App**, **Mobile offline profile**, and **Sync Error** tables. Learn about [Create or edit a security role to manage access](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-security-role).

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended that the [canvas app is in a solution](../maker/canvas-apps/add-app-solution.md). The offline profile **App usage** field in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) (**Environements** > _select an environment_ > **Settings** > **User + permissions** > **Mobile configuration**) only applies to apps within a solution.  

## Optimize your app for mobile offline

Mobile apps run on small screens with limited connectivity. Before you set up offline mode, make sure your canvas app is optimized for offline and mobile use. Consider the user scenarios you want to cover and the amount of data the app uses. Create an app that's simple and lightweight.

Follow these best practices when you build an app for mobile offline use:

- Performance is critical when you run an app on mobile. For more information about creating performant canvas apps, see [Overview of creating performant apps](../maker/canvas-apps/create-performant-apps-overview.md).
    
- Identify the on-the-go scenarios that are functionally related, such as tasks that are performed by users who work in the field.

- Reduce the complexity of your app by limiting the number of tables that need to be downloaded. Sometimes it's better to have two apps instead of one.

- Use views that are optimized for the experience rather than displaying a large set of data. For example, it's preferable to use the **My active accounts** view, rather than the **All accounts** view.

## Turn on offline capability for tables

Tables included in an offline app must be configured for offline use. Some built-in tables have it by default. Some tables can't be used offline. However, you can turn on offline capability for any new, custom table.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. In the left side panel, select **Tables**.
1. Select a table, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Edit table properties**.
1. Select **Advanced options**, and then scroll to the **Rows in this table** section.
1. Select **Can be taken offline**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/can-be-taken-offline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the table editing options, with **Can be taken offline** highlighted.":::
1. Select **Save**.

## Turn on offline capability for your app

1. In [Power Apps Studio](../maker/canvas-apps/power-apps-studio.md), in the left side panel, select **Apps**.
1. Select your canvas app, and then select **Edit**.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **General**.
1. Turn on the **Can be used offline** option.

    If you don't see the **Can be used offline** option, make sure the app is [in a solution](../maker/canvas-apps/add-app-solution.md).

1. Select an offline profile. You have two options:

    - **Autogenerated profile**: This setting downloads all the tables used in your app automatically. Autogenerated profiles are a starting point to create an offline profile and help makers validate their offline data. These profiles can be resource-intensive as they don't compute optimal filters for each table or assess the amount of data the app must download offline. App makers need to review and refine these profiles based on their use case. 

    - **Custom mobile profile**: Custom offline profiles let makers add only relevant tables, limit data usage and include filters based on their needs and best practices. These profiles offer flexibility and control, enhancing the user experience by downloading relevant data, improving sync times, and boosting query performance.
       
1. Close the **Settings** window, and then save and publish your app.

A page that's based on the [Offline template](canvas-mobile-offline-setup.md#using-the-offline-template-and-offline-status-icon) is automatically inserted in the app. The page contains an icon that uses the [Connection](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/signals#connection) Power Fx function to reflect the app's [offline sync status](canvas-mobile-offline-working.md#sync-status-icons). You can use it as-is or customize it, as appropriate.

> [!NOTE]
> - You can use the same, offline profile in different canvas apps. The users can use the apps and share the same, offline profile in disconnected mode. The updates done in one app are reflected in the other apps since the apps share the same, local storage with this setup. 
> - ALM isn't currently supported for autogenerated profiles.
> - If your organization uses ALM and you're moving your app between environments, ensure that your offline profile is tested for all use cases in the target environment.

If the automatically generated offline profile doesn't meet your needs, create your own. [Learn about guidelines for offline profiles](mobile-offline-guidelines.md).

## Create an offline profile

You need to publish your new offline profile before you can select it in your canvas app's settings. If you edit and publish an offline profile, you must also publish any canvas apps that use it. 

There are two ways you can create offline profile.

### Create a custom mobile offline profile from within Power apps studio (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2216214), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is in the process of rolling out and might not be available in your region yet.

1. Go to App > Settings.
1. Turn on the **Can be used offline** setting.
1. In the drop-down menu, select an offline profile. You can select the **Auto-generated** option or **New profile with current app data**.
1. Enter a name and description for the profile. Add the tables you need for the profile. For those tables, apply filters (as detailed below—see the hyperlink to the following section) and choose columns as described in [Optimize the offline profile - Power Apps | Microsoft Learn](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/optimize-offline-profile).
1. Save the profile.
1. Publish the profile.

### Create profiles from within Power Platform admin center (with admin rights)

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) using an admin account.

1. In the left side panel, select **Environments**.

1. Select an environment, and then select **Settings**.

1. Expand **Users + permissions**, and then select **Mobile configuration**.

1. Select **Create new profile**.

1. Enter a name and description, and then select **Create**.

1. After the profile is created, select it to continue editing it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't add users in the offline profile in the **Users with offline access** area. This capability is only applicable to model-driven apps and is restricted to selected users. 
  
### Add a table to an offline profile and apply filters

Applying an appropriate filter for each of the tables configured in the offline profile is critical to limiting the amount of data that downloads on users' devices.

Be sure that you configure at least one of the profile rules for each table to download its data. 

|Customization |Recommendation|  
|-------------|---------|  
|Organization rows - if selected, then select at least one of these options:<br><br>- **User's rows**<br>- **Team rows**<br>- **Business unit rows**  |	If you want to define this filter, then you have to pick at least one of the given options. It's highly recommended to not have a business unit-level filter for a table, unless there's a strong justification. It's recommended for a master data scenario with a small data set, like country codes. |
|All rows|	If you select this filter, you can't define any other filter rules.|
|Related rows only | Be sure that the related table has been added to the offline profile.|
|Custom | You can define a custom filter up to three levels deep. |


1. In the **Data available offline** section, select **Add table**.

1. Select a table, and then define the filters.

1. Select **Next**.
   
1. Set the following filters:
   
    1. Choose the row that you want to make available offline. For the **Custom** option, use the [expression builder](../maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-view-filters.md) to set up advanced conditions.

    1. **Relationships** lists the different relationships available between the current table and other tables added in the offline profile. Selecting a relationship ensures that related rows following that relationship are downloaded and made available offline.
      
    1. **Sync interval** defines the sync frequency to be applied on the device that syncs with the data with the server. If a table's data doesn't change frequently, like a catalog or a product table, you might want to focus on only syncing data when necessary, such as refreshing only once a day.

1. Select **Save**.

Each table in your offline setup can link to up to 15 other tables through filters or relationships. If you link to a table that already connects to other tables, those connections count toward the limit. For example, if Table B connects to two other tables and you link Table A to Table B, Table A has three relationships: one for Table B and two for the tables Table B connects to. This setup is a transitive relationship. If any table has more than 15 total connections, you get an error and can't publish the offline profile.


## Using the Offline template and offline status icon

To make it easier to create or convert a canvas app for offline use, we created the **Offline** template. The template includes a globe icon in the navigation bar that shows the connectivity and sync state, putting offline at the center of the experience. Users always know whether their device and data are ready to go.

A new page created from the **Offline** template is automatically inserted as soon as you turn on the offline capability in your canvas app.

:::image type="content" source="media/new-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a page based on the Offline template shown in the Power Apps Studio canvas.":::

You can also add a new page based on the **Offline** template the same way you add pages from any other template.
  
:::image type="content" source="media/offline-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Templates gallery, with the Offline template highlighted.":::

The globe icon in the template's navigation bar uses different icons depending on the value of the Power Fx `Connection.Sync` function. You can create your own icon and set the **Icon** property using the following Power Fx script:

```powerappsfl
Switch(Connection.Sync, 

   ConnectionSync.Connected, Icon.Globe,  

   ConnectionSync.ConnectedWithWarning, Icon.GlobeWarning, 

   ConnectionSync.ConnectedPendingUpsync, Icon.GlobeChangesPending, 

   ConnectionSync.ConnectedError, Icon.GlobeError, 

   ConnectionSync.ConnectedRefresh, Icon.GlobeRefresh, 

   ConnectionSync.NotConnected, Icon.GlobeNotConnected,  

   ConnectionSync.NotConnectedWithWarning, Icon.GlobeWarning, 

   ConnectionSync.NotConnectedPendingUpsync, Icon.GlobeChangesPending, 

   ConnectionSync.NotConnectedSyncError, Icon.GlobeError) 
```
You can set the **OnSelect** property using the Power Fx function `ShowHostInfo` to show the [Device status page](/power-apps/mobile/offline-sync-icon#device-status-page) when selecting the globe icon. 

```powerappsfl
ShowHostInfo(HostInfo.OfflineSync)
```
You can set the **Visible** property using the Power Fx function `Host` to only show the globe icon when the app is used on a player that's supporting the offline mode. 

```powerappsfl
Host.OfflineEnabled
```
    
## Export a solution that contains a canvas app enabled for offline

When you export a solution with an offline canvas app, you also need to export the offline profile for the app, as it's a dependency of the app.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and in the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.

2. Select the solution that you want to export and then select **Edit**.

3. Select the canvas app that is enabled for offline and then select **Advanced** > **Add required objects**.

Make sure that the associated offline profile is in the solution and then you can export it.
