# Configure mobile offline synchronization for Power Apps mobile 

Mobile offline allows users to use the [Power Apps mobile](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/downloads/) app in offline mode. Model-driven app users can interact with their data, even when they don't have internet connection. 

To enable users to use Power Apps mobile in offline mode, you need to configure mobile offline synchronization for your organization. When mobile offline synchronization is set up then your app users can start using Power Apps mobile in offline mode. For more information see,  [Configure mobile offline synchronization](/dynamics365/mobile-app/preview-setup-mobile-offline).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The [Configure mobile offline synchronization](/dynamics365/mobile-app/preview-setup-mobile-offline) topic covers how to set up mobile offline synchronization for both Power Apps mobile and the Dynamics 365 phones and tablet app. The set up process is the same for both apps.
