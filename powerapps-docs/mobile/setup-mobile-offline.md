# Configure mobile offline synchronization for the Power Apps mobile app

Mobile offline allows users to use the Power Apps mobile app in offline mode. Users can interact with their data, even when they are not connected to the internet. To allow users to use Power Apps mobile in offline mode, you need to configure mobile offline synchronization. For more information see,  [Configure mobile offline synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/preview-setup-mobile-offline).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Configure mobile offline synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/preview-setup-mobile-offline) topic covers how to set up mobile offline synchronization for both Power Apps mobile and the Dynamics 365 phones and tablet app. The process is the same for both apps.
