# Use Power Apps for Windows 

This topic covers how to sign in and run your apps on Power Apps for Windows.

## Sign in 

Sign into Power Apps for Windows quickly using your work email address. If you need help with your sign-in information, contact your Power Apps administrator. 

1.  On the Welcome screen, select **Sign in**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Sign in.](media/pam-windows-image1.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You also have the option to sign in as a guest user and choose a different region.
    >  ![Sign in to a differnt region.](media/mobile-gcc.png)


2.  Enter your email address, and then select **Next**. Then enter your password and then select **Sign in**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Enter your email addreass.](media/pam-windows-image2.png)

3.  From the list of apps that you have access to, select the app that you want to use.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select an app to use.](media/pam-windows-image3.png)

### See non-production apps

By default, only production model-driven apps are shown in the list of apps.

To see model-driven apps from non-production environments, select the More button (...) > **Settings** and then turn on **Show non-production apps**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![See non-production apps.](media/non-prod-apps.png)



## Move between apps

When you're using an app, you can select the back button to go back to the **Apps** screen. From the **Apps** screen, you can then select another app to use.

For model-driven apps, you can also select the name of the current app that you're using to go back to the **Apps** screen.

## Switch to another canvas app

1.  Select the back button.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Go back.](media/pam-windows-image4.png)

2.  On the **Apps** screen select an app. You'll only see apps for your organization.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![From the list of apps, select an app.](media/pam-windows-image3.png)

## Switch to another model-driven app

1.  Select the back button or select the current app name.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    >![Graphical user interface  application Description automatically generated](media/pam-windows-image5.png)

2.  On the **Apps** screen select an app. You'll only see apps for your organization.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![From the list of apps, select an app.](media/pam-windows-image3.png)

## Run an app

Because [canvas apps](../maker/canvas-apps/getting-started.md) can essentially be anything, there isn't much help documentation on how to use an app once it's created. If you need help using a canvas app, contact your app maker or Power Apps admin.

You'll find below the documentation on how to run [model-driven apps](../user/use-model-driven-apps.md) on Power Apps for Windows.

## Navigation in model-driven apps

It's easy to get around and get back to your favorite or most-used rows. The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements for a model-driven app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
>![Navigation in model-driven apps.](media/pam-windows-image6.png)

Legend:

1. **Click to change app**: Select the current app name to change to a different app.

2. **Collapse/expand site map**: Select this to collapse the navigator to allow more room for the main part of the page. If the navigator is already collapsed, select this button to expand it again.

3. **Recent**: Expand this entry to view a list of rows you were recently using. Select a row here to open it. Select the push-pin icon next to a row listed here to add it to your pinned rows.

4. **Pinned**: Expand this entry to view and open your favorite pinned rows. Use the **Recent** list to add rows here. Select the remove-pin icon next to a row listed here to remove it from this list.

5. **Page navigation**: This area lists each table and dashboard page available for the current work area. Select any entry here to open the named dashboard or list view for that table.

6. **Create new row**: Select **New** to create a new row.

7. **Setting**: Access your setting such as personalization setting and information about the app.

8. **User Information**: See the current user that's signed in, sign out of the app, or reconfigure the app**.**

9. **Go back**: Use the back button for form, view, and dashboard pages on the command bar to go back to the previous page.


### Create and edit rows

The **New** button or **Quick create** makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the navigation bar, so it's available whenever you need to enter new information into the system. You can also save a row and create a new one directly from the **Quick create** form.

Note, the Quick create option is only available for rows that are enabled by your admin.

1.  On the navigation bar, select the **plus sign** ![Create a row button ](media/pam-windows-image8.png), and then select the item you want.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select to create a new row.](media/pam-windows-image9.png)

2.  Fill in the columns, and then select **Save and Close**. Or, to save and create another row, select the down arrow and then select **Save & Create New**

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Save a row.](media/pam-windows-image10.png)


### Create a new row using the New button

1.  From the left navigation pane, select a table such as **Products** and then select **New**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Add new row](media/pam-windows-image11.png)

2.  Fill in the columns and then on the command bar, select **Save** or **Save & Close**.

### Edit a row

1.  From the left navigation pane, select a table such as **Products**.

2.  Select a row to open it.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select the row name to pen it.](media/pam-windows-image12.png)

3.  Make your edits and when you're done editing, select **Save** or **Save & Close**.

## Use search

With Dataverse search, the search box is always available at the top of every page in your app. You can start a new search and quickly find the information that you're looking for. For more information, see [Search for tables and rows by using Dataverse search](../user/relevance-search.md).

![Search bar at the top](media/pam-windows-image13.png)

## Notifications 

Notifications on Power Apps for Windows work the same as when you run a model-driven app on the web. For more information, see [In-app notifications in model-driven apps](../user/notifications.md).

## Set up mobile offline

To configure your app in offline mode, see:
 
- For canvas apps: [Develop offline-capable canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/offline-apps.md)
- For model-driven apps: [Set up mobile offline](setup-mobile-offline.md)


## Session ID

If you are having an issue with Power Apps for Windows then send a description of your issue with a screenshot and the session ID to [pamobsup@microsoft.com](mailto:pamobsup@microsoft.com?subject=Power%20Mobile%20issues). 

To get the session ID, select the More button (...) > **Settings** and then copy the session ID.
