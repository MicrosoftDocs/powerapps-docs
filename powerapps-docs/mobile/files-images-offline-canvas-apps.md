# Configure files and images in offline canvas apps

This article explains how to configure files and images in a Power Apps table for offline canvas apps.

## Prerequisites

- Have an existing canvas with Dataverse tables. For more information, see [Build an app](../maker/canvas-apps/getting-started.md#build-an-app).

### View column properties for a file or image

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the left navigation menu, select **Tables**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)] 

1. Select the table that has the columns you want to view. 

1. Under **Schema**, select **Columns**.
  
1. Select the **Display name** of a column where **Data type** is set to **File** or **Image**.

1. The column properties show the **Data type**. Expand **Advanced options** to view the maximum size for a file or image. For more information about columns, see [Columns overview](../maker/data-platform/fields-overview.md).


## Download options

In an offline-enabled canvas app, there are two ways to download files and images:

- **On view**: Downloaded when you view themâ€”the default option.
- **On sync**: Downloaded during offline sync when device is connected.

### Download files and images on view

When files and images are configured to download **on view**, the content is downloaded on the device when the user opens a file or when an image is presented to the user. Files and images are downloaded when the device is connected to the network and can be used afterward without connectivity.

This mode is enabled by default without any specific configuration.

If you want to keep this default, then you don't need to proceed with this article.

### Download files and images on sync

When files and images are configured to download **on sync**, they're downloaded during the offline sync when the device is connected. The user can access the content without connectivity and is notified when the download of the files and images is completed. **On sync** is recommended if you don't need to download a large number of files or images.

The remainder of this article helps you configure on sync.

## Configure on sync

### Prerequisites - mobile offline profile

To configure the automatic download of files and images on sync, you need to  [create a mobile offline profile](canvas-mobile-offline-setup.md#create-a-mobile-offline-profile) in the Power Platform admin center.

### Enable offline access to images and files

You can add both the **Image Descriptor** and **FileAttachment** tables to your mobile offline profile by configuring the settings of your environment.

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) and sign-in as an admin.

1. Select **Environments** from the navigation menu.

1. Choose an environment and then select **Settings** on the menu bar.

1. Expand **Users + permissions**, then select **Mobile configuration**.
