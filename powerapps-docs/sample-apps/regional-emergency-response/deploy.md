# Deploy the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution

Regional organization IT admins can use this article to deploy the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution. At the end of this deployment process, you will have the following:

- An admin app (model-driven app) that lets you configure and view master data for parent organizations and their hospital systems, add and manage admin users from parent organizations so that they can use the portal to report data for their hospital systems.

- A web portal that enables individual parent organizations to add and manage data related to their users, hospital systems, regions, facilities, patients, supplies, and staff.

- A Power BI dashboard that your regional admins can access in your Power BI tenant to view key data and insights for all the parent organizations that report data to your regional organization. The same dashboard is embedded in the portal for parent organization admins to view key data and insights just for their parent organizations and hospital systems.

Perform the following steps to deploy the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution for your organization.

Estimated time to complete these steps: 35–40 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an existing installation of this solution, follow the steps here instead to upgrade to the latest version: [Upgrade the solution](upgrade.md)

    > ![Solution package properties](media/deploy-deployment-package.png "Solution package properties")

On extracting the .zip file, you will see the following in the extracted folder:

|**Folder**  |**Description**  |
|---------|---------|
|**Package**     |  The folder contains the Package Deployer tool and the package that you will import later to set up the solution in your environment.       |
|**Power BI Template**     | Contains the Power BI Report template file (.pbit) that you will use to configure reporting. More information: [Step 5: Configure and publish Power BI dashboard](#step-5-configure-and-publish-power-bi-dashboard)        |
|**SampleData**     |   Contains the sample master data files (.xlsx) that you can use to import sample data. More information: [Import data using sample files](configure.md#import-data-using-sample-files)      |

## Step 2: Sign up for Power Apps and create an environment

If you don't already have Power Apps, sign up for Power Apps and purchase an appropriate license.
More information:

- [Power Apps Pricing](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/)

- [Purchase Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin)

After you have purchased Power Apps, create an environment with a Common Data Service database.

1.  Sign in to [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

2.  Create a Common Data Service environment with the database. More information: [Create and manage environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment)

    > [!IMPORTANT] 
    > While creating the database, if you select a security group for the database, the apps can be shared only with users that are members of the security group.

3.	Create appropriate users in your environment. More information: [Create users and assign security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles)

After you have created your environment, you can access it using the following URL: https://[myenv].crm.dynamics.com, where [myenv] is the name of your environment. Make a note of this environment URL.

## Step 3: Create a Power Apps portal in your environment

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Flows in the app](media/conf-all-flows.png "Flows in the app")

There are two sets of flows:

- First set of flows help with sending emails:
    - Portal User Request: Send Email on Decline Request
    - Portal User Request: Send Email to Admins on Request Creation
    
    For these flows, we have to authorize the connection and then specify a user account to send emails, and then enable the flow.

- Second set of flows help complete a task:
    - Process new Supplies Entry records
    - Flow supply tracking
    - Populate CDC Data - Healthcare Staff
    - Populate CDC Data - Healthcare Supply
    - Populate CDC Data - Patients and Hospitals Capacities

    - Populate CDC Data - Patients and Hospitals Capacities
    - Process new Staffing Entry for the Portal

## Step 12: Share admin app with other admin users

For your business admin users to use the admin app (model-driven app) to enter and manage data, it must be shared with them. It's easier to use Azure AD groups to easily share apps with a group of admin users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the user or group you plan to share the app with already have access to your environment. Typically, you would have already added users or group while setting up your environment. Alternatively, you can follow the steps here to add users to your environment and provide appropriate access before sharing app with them: [Create users and assign security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles).

1.  Sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

2.  In the left navigation pane, select **Apps**, select the model-driven app (**Admin App – Regional Emergency Response App**) and select **Share** in the banner.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Share admin app](media/deploy-share-admin-app.png "Share admin app")

3.  Specify the Azure AD group or admin users that you want to share this app with, assign the **Regional Emergency Response Admin** security role, and select **Share**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Specify Azure AD group or admin users](media/deploy-specify-share.png "Specify Azure AD group or admin users")

## Next steps

The deployment steps are complete now. Business admins can refer to the [configuration](configure.md) topic to perform the following steps:

-  Configure and manage the master data

-  Create portal users to invite admin users from individual hospitals so that they can use portals to add and manage data and users.

- View Power BI dashboard in your tenant.
