# Administer the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring portal

Hospital staff are challenged to meet an increase in number of patients while managing supply chain during emergency. By using the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring
portal, administrators can quickly view and update data related to **Users**, **Systems**, **Regions**, and **Facilities**. Stakeholders can view the published insights through dashboards for current status of the health care system and take actions.

## Portal at a glance

Browse to the Power Apps portal to add, edit or delete **Users**, **Systems**, **Regions**, and **Facilities**. The following section walks you through what you can
access, submit, or update as the administrator of the portal.

![Portal at glance](media/portal-at-glance.png)
