# Use the admin app and dashboard

This article is meant for business admins in regional medical organizations to use the admin app (model-driven app) to perform the following activities:

-   Add and manage master data in entities required for the solution

-   Create and manage portal users (contacts). These users are typically the admins from parent medical organizations that manage one or more hospital systems.

- View approve, and decline portal user requests.

- View Power BI dashboards in their tenant.

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have the appropriate security role and access to the admin app (model-driven app). Contact your IT Admin if you are unable to access or use the admin app.

-   Ensure you have access to the sample data. The sample data is available in the deployment package under the **SampleData** folder.

## Add and manage master data

When you sign into the admin (model-driven) app, you will see the entities in the left pane where you need to populate the master data. Select the entity in the left navigation pane to view or manage the data.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Populate the master data](media/config-entities-master-data.png "Populate the master data")

-   **Hierarchy area**: Data for entities in this area can be added either by importing data from the sample data files or manually. The entities under the **Hierarchy** area are listed in the order you should populate data. Also, parent org admins (hospital admins) can view and manage data under the following entities for their hospital from the portal: **Systems**, **Regions**, and **Facilities**.

-   **Admin Entities area**: Data in the **Supplies** entity is added by importing data from the sample data file. You can manually add and manage supplies data later.

-   **Customers area**: You use **Portal Users** to [manage portal users](#manage-portal-users) and **User Requests** to [manage portal user requests](#manage-portal-user-requests).

-   **Resources area**: Select **Documentation** to view this document.

There are two ways in which you can add master data to entities in the app:

-  Import data using the sample data files.

-  Manually configure and manage the data.

### Import data using sample files

The sample data files are available in the deployment package (.zip). When you extract the .zip file, the sample data files are available under the **SampleData** folder.

Under the **SampleData** folder, the files are named to denote the sequence in which data should be imported into your app. Otherwise, data import will fail.

-   0_Supplies.xlsx

-   1_Counties.xlsx

-   2_Regional Organization.xlsx

-   3_Parent Organizations.xlsx

-   4_Systems.xlsx

-   5_Regions.xlsx

-   6_Facilities.xlsx

> [!NOTE]
> We provide name and FIPS code for all the counties in the Washington state as sample data that you can import. You should import the **Counties** data using the sample data file into your system before proceeding with importing or managing data in any other entities.
> 
> To obtain data about counties in other states, visit <https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2018/demo/popest/2018-fips.html>

#### How to load data from data files

To load sample data from the Excel file to an entity: 

1.  In the left navigation pane of the admin app, select select an entity. For example, select **Parent Org**. 

2.  Select **Import from Excel** to select the data file. 

       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
       > ![Import from Excel](media/config-import-excel.png "Import from Excel")

3.  Browse to the **SampleData** folder and select the **3_Parent Organizations.xlsx** file and proceed with the wizard steps to import the data.  

4.  After the sample data is imported, you will see the imported records in the entity:

       > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
       > ![Imported records in entity](media/config-imported-records.png "Imported records in entity")

### Manually configure and manage master data for your organization

Admins can use the model-driven app in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) to create and manage master data for their organization. This data is required for the Emergency Response Solution to work.

To start, you must add master data in the following entities:

-   [Supplies](#supplies-and-counties-data)

-   [Counties](#supplies-and-counties-data)

-   [Regional Org](#regional-org-data)

-   [Parent Org](#parent-org-data)

-   [Hospital systems](#systems-data) managed by each parent org

-   [Regions](#regions-data)) for each hospital system

-   [Facilities](#facilities-data)) within each region of a hospital system

Sign into the admin app using the URL provided by your IT admin to add and manage data.

## Manage portal users

Use the **Portal Users** entity to add and manage portal users. These portal users are the admins from the various parent organizations who report their hospital systems data to regional organizations and also manage other admins, healthcare workers, or report viewers using the portals.

### Create a portal user

1.  Sign into the admin app using the URL provided by your IT admin.

2.  In the left pane, select **Portal Users**. You see a list of portal users, if they are already added by other admins in your org. Selecting a user will open the details about the user.

3.  Select **New** to create a new portal user. On the **New Contact** page, specify appropriate values

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Create a portal user](media/config-portal-user.png "Create a portal user")

    | **Field**           | **Description**  |
    |---------------------|-------------------|

    | Last Name           | Last name of the user  |
    | Email     | Email of the user where the invitation will be sent.    |
    | Parent Organization | Select a parent organization that this portal user will be associated with. This ensures that the user has access only to the hospital systems data under the selected parent org. If you don’t specify a parent org for the user, she/she will have access to data for all the parent orgs under the regional org. |
    | Hospital System     | Select a hospital that this portal user will be associated with. |
    | Region  | Select a region that this portal user will be associated with.  |
    | Facility            | Select a facility that this portal user will be associated with. |

4.  Save the record. On saving the record, the **Web Roles** area becomes available. Select **Add Existing Web Role.**

5.  In the lookup records page, press enter to displays the existing web roles.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Select a role](media/config-select-portal-role.png "Select a role")

6. Select roles as per the portal access you need to provide to the user. To give access to all the features in the portal, select all the three roles: **Organization HealthCare Worker**, **Parent Organization Administrator**, and **Report Viewer**.

    For information about portal access each of these roles provide, see the [Create user](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/portals-admin-reporting#create-user) section in the portal administration topic.

    To grant a role, select the role, and select **Add**.

7. Save the portal user record.

Depending on the roles(s) you granted to the user, she/he will view respective areas in the portal. More information: [Portal for admins and report viewers](portals-admin-reporting.md) and [Portal for healthcare workers](portals-user.md)

An email will be sent automatically to the newly created user with an invitation code to join portals. The portal user can redeem the invitation to sign in and start using the portal. More information: [Get started with the portal](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/portals-admin-reporting#getting-started-with-the-portal)

## Manage portal user requests

You can view, approve, and decline portal user requests using the **User Requests** option.

Use the appropriate view to view a list of approved, declined, inactive, and pending user requests.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Select a view](media/configure-portal-request-views.png "Select a view")

### Approve or decline user request

To approve or decline user requests:

1.  Sign into the admin app using the URL provided by your IT admin.

2.  In the left pane, select **User Requests**, and then select **Pending Portal User Requests** view. You see a list of portal user requests pending for approval.

3.  Double-click a user request to open it.

4.  On the user request form:

    1. Select the appropriate roles for the user in the **Choose roles for the user** area. To grant or deny a role, select **Yes** or **No** respectively for each role.

    1. From the **Request State** list, select **Approve** or **Decline**.

    1. Select the save icon in the lower-right corner.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
        > ![Approve or reject a user request](media/user-request-manage.png "Approve or reject a user request")

Based on the approval or decline, the following happens:

- If you *approve* the access request, the user record is created with selected roles and the user receives an email with invitation code. The user can redeem the invitation code to sign in to the portal. More information: [Redeem invitation](portals-admin-reporting.md#redeem-invitation)

- If you *decline* the access request, the user record isn't created, and the user receives an email stating that the request is declined.

## View the Power BI dashboard

Business admins in the regional organization can view the Power BI dashboard in their Power BI tenant if the regional IT admin published the report as an app and granted access to business admins. More information: [Step 5: Configure and publish Power BI dashboard](deploy.md#step-5-configure-and-publish-power-bi-dashboard) 

To view the Power BI dashboard:

1. Sign into [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com).

2. The workspace where the app was published will be available for you to access the dashboard.

3. The Power BI dashboard that is available to you in your Power BI tenant is the same as the one available to users of the portal. The **primary difference** is that as a business admin of a regional organization, you can view data for all the parent organizations that report data to the regional organization, whereas users viewing the dashboard embedded in portal can only view data for their parent organization and associated hospital systems.

For detailed information presented in the Power BI dashboard, see [Get insights](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/portals-admin-reporting#get-insights) in the portal topic.
