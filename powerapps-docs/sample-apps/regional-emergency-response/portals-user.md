# Use the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring portal

Hospital staff are challenged to meet an increase in number of patients while managing supply chain during emergency. By using the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring portal, health care workers can quickly view and add data for ventilators, staffing, pending discharges, and COVID-19 related patients.

## Portal at a glance

Browse to the Power Apps portal to work with staffing, equipment, supplies, patient, and other areas. The following section walks you through what you can access, submit, or update as the health care user of the portal.

> The supply inventory item values must be in number format. The supply number is for **individual component**. For example, N-95 masks are counted by each individual mask instead of counting the number of boxes containing masks.

#### Supply considerations

- For calculation of on hand supply, we recommend using the [Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/burn-calculator.html).
- More information about conservation strategy available at [Conservation Strategies for Personal Protective Equipment](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/ConservationStrat-PPE.pdf).
- **Extended use**: Wearing for repeated close contact encounters with several patients without removing between patients.
- **Reuse**: Using same PPE for multiple encounters with patients but removing it (*doffing*) after each encounter.
- **Ventilator Disposables use/reuse**: When considering definitions for extended use or reusing ventilator supplies, please refer to the [Scarce Resource Management and Crisis Standards of Care Overview](https://nwhrn.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scarce_Resource_Management_and_Crisis_Standards_of_Care_Overview_and_Materials-2020-04-10.pdf) document.
