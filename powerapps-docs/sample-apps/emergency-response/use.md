# Use the Hospital Emergency Response mobile app

Hospital staff are challenged to meet an increase in number of
patients while managing supply chain during emergency. By using the Hospital Emergency Response mobile app, frontline workers can quickly view and add data for ventilators, staffing, pending discharges, and COVID-19 related patients.

## Prerequisites

To get started with the mobile app, you need to download the Power Apps Mobile on your
device using the device's app store.

- **Download** the [**Power Apps Mobile**](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/downloads)
    - For **Apple** devices with iOS such as iPhone and iPad, use [**App store**](https://aka.ms/powerappsios)
    - For **Android** devices, use [**Google Play**](https://aka.ms/powerappsandroid)
- Ensure your organization has deployed and configured the Hospital Emergency Response mobile app as explained in [Deploy and configure the app](deploy-configure.md).

After you install the Power Apps Mobile, open the app from your device and
sign in with your company's Azure Active Directory account. You can view all
apps shared to you by your organization once you sign in. For more information, see [Power Apps mobile device sign
in](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-app-client#open-power-apps-and-sign-in).

## Hospital Emergency Response mobile app

![Hospital Emergency Response mobile app](media/use/app-launcher.png)

The Hospital Emergency Response mobile app has a modular structure with different apps as applicable to your role. Open the Hospital Emergency Response mobile app from the Power Apps Mobile app, select your **Hospital system**, **Region, Facility**, and select **Next** to get started.

> [!NOTE]
> When you launch the Hospital Emergency Response mobile app or any of
its components for the *first time*, you will be asked for your consent to allow the app to read your *Office 365 Users* profile and your *Location*. You must select **Allow** before you can start using the selected app. For more information, see [give consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/run-app-client#give-consent).

![Hospital Emergency Response mobile app components](media/use/app-components.png)

The Hospital Emergency Response sample solution app consists of multiple apps for enhanced user experience. Depending on your role, you may see one or more components in the **Hospital Emergency Response mobile app**.

## Hospital operations

Use the hospital operations apps to collect hospital and facility-specific data for hospital management.

- [COVID-19 stats](#covid-19-stats)
    <br> Collect status on how many patients are under investigation for COVID-19 and how many tested positive.

- [Equipment](#equipment)
    <br> Track equipment information such as ventilators, NIPPV, and PAPR.

- [Staff](#staff)
    <br> Collect number of patients and RN status information such as partners, assigned, requested, and unassigned.

- [Supplies](#supplies)
    <br> Track key supplies to track, manage, and forecast inventory more
    effectively. ​

- [Staffing needs](#staffing-needs)
    <br> Collect requests for personnel by department, role, and urgency.

- [Discharge planning](#discharge-planning)
    <br> Collect status and projections on ​patient discharges.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, you can track information in the following apps at a *location* level: **COVID-19 stats**, **Equipment**, and **Staff**. In rest of the apps, you can track information at the *facility* level by default. Your admin can change the default tracking level, if required.

##### Supply considerations

- For calculation of on hand supply, we recommend using the [Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/burn-calculator.html).
- More information about conservation strategy available at [Conservation Strategies for Personal Protective Equipment](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/ConservationStrat-PPE.pdf).
- **Extended use**: Wearing for repeated close contact encounters with several patients without removing between patients.
- **Reuse**: Using same PPE for multiple encounters with patients but removing it (*doffing*) after each encounter.
- **Ventilator Disposables use/reuse**: When considering definitions for extended use or reusing ventilator supplies, refer to the [Scarce Resource Management and Crisis Standards of Care Overview](https://nwhrn.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Scarce_Resource_Management_and_Crisis_Standards_of_Care_Overview_and_Materials-2020-04-10.pdf) document.
