1.  In the app details page:
 
    1. To select a custom image for the app icon as per your organization branding, double-click the app icon, and select an icon file of your choice.

    3. If necessary, update the **Description** or **Display Name** of the app.

    > [!TIP]
    > You might want to choose a different display name to identify apps in your test environment. For example: **Test - Bed capacity**.

    4. If necessary, update the **Hide App from Menu** value to set if the app should be displayed in the app list. As **Emergency Response App** is a container app, the value is set to **No** by default.

    5. If necessary, update the **App Display Rank** value to set the display position of app in the app list.

    6. If necessary, select a value in the **Tracking Level** field to specify if you want to track data in this mobile app at a **Location** or **Facility** level. More information: [Manage tracking level for mobile apps](configure-data-reporting.md#manage-tracking-level-for-mobile-apps)

    7. Select **Save**.

1.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each canvas app record under **Apps**.

1.  In the left pane, select **App Config**.

1.  Select the **Emergency Response App** record to open it for editing.

1.  If necessary, update the colors for your mobile app.

    > [!TIP]
    > You might want to specify a different primary color to identify apps in your test environment.

2.  Select **Yes** or **No** in the **Device Sharing Enabled** field to specify whether a **Sign Out** option will be available in mobile apps or not. Selecting **Yes** will make the **Sign Out** option available. More information: [End shift - sign out](use.md#end-shift---sign-out) in the user guide.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Device Sharing Enabled field](media/conf-device-sharing-enabled-field.png "Device Sharing Enabled field")

1.  Select **Save** in the lower-right corner to save your changes.

## Step 5: Bypass consent for mobile apps (optional)

Optionally, you can configure to bypass user consent for your mobile apps so that users are not permitted for location permissions. You must be a Tenant Admin to complete this step. Also, before you perform this step, you will need app ID of each mobile app (canvas app).

To get the app ID for your app, in the left navigation pane of the admin app, select **Administration** from the area picker and then select **Apps**. This displays all the mobile apps (canvas apps). Select a mobile app to view its app ID. Copy the app Id for each app to a notepad file.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Get the app ID](media/conf-admin-get-app-id.png "Get the app ID")

Next do the following:

1.  Open Notepad, and copy this PowerShell script:

    ```powershell
    # MUST BE A TENANT ADMIN TO RUN THIS
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell -AllowClobber
    Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
    Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell
    
    # This call opens prompt to collect credentials 
    # (Azure Active Directory account and password) 
    # used by the commands
    Add-PowerAppsAccount
    
    # Change the App ID for each new app (APPGUIDHERE)
    Set-AdminPowerAppApisToBypassConsent -AppName APPGUIDHERE
    ```

2.  Replace the `APPGUIDHERE` value with the actual app ID of a canvas app.

3.  Save the file as .ps1 file.

4.  Run PowerShell as an administrator and execute the .ps1 file you just created.

5.  Repeat steps 2 - 4 for each canvas app.

## Step 6: Add Azure Application Insights key to mobile apps for telemetry (optional)

Optionally, you can use Azure Application Insights to collect detailed telemetry for your mobile apps (canvas apps) to get insights on the app usage. For detailed information about this, see [Analyze app telemetry using Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/application-insights)

## Step 7: Share canvas apps with users in your organization

For your frontline users to use and consume data using the canvas apps in their
mobile devices, the apps must be shared with them. It's easier to use Azure AD
groups to easily share apps with groups of users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the user or group you plan to share the apps with *already* have access to your environment. Typically, you would have already added users or group while [setting up your environment](#step-2-sign-up-for-power-apps-and-create-an-environment). Alternatively, you can follow the steps here to add users to your environment and provide appropriate access before sharing apps with them: [Create users and assign security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles).

1.  Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com)

2.  In the left navigation pane, select **Apps** to view a list of all your
    apps.

3.  Select a mobile app (canvas app) and select **Share** in the banner.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Share canvas apps](media/conf-share-canvas-apps.png "Share canvas apps")

4.  Specify the Azure AD group or users that you want to share this app with. As the app connects to Common Data Service data, you will also need to provide permissions to the entities. The sharing panel prompts you to manage security for the entities. Assign the **Emergency Response User** and **Common Data Service User** security roles to the entities used by this app and select **Share**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Share app with Azure AD group or users](media/conf-share-app-groups-users.png "Share app with Azure AD group or users")

5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each mobile app.

Detailed information about sharing your apps: [Share a canvas app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app)

## Step 8: Set your mobile app as hero and featured app (optional)

Optionally, you can set your mobile app as the hero and featured app within the **Power Apps** mobile app. You must be a Tenant Admin to complete this step.

Before you perform this step, you will need app ID of each mobile app (canvas app) that you want to set as hero and featured app. For info about getting app ID for a canvas app, see 

Next, do the following:

1.  Open Notepad, and copy this PowerShell script:


    ```powershell
    # MUST BE A TENANT ADMIN TO RUN THIS
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell -AllowClobber
    Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
    Import-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell

    # This call opens prompt to collect credentials 
    # (Azure Active Directory account and password) 
    # used by the commands
    Add-PowerAppsAccount

    # Use the "Emergency Response App" App ID
    # To clear a featured app use Clear-AdminPowerAppAsFeatured

    #Change the App ID for each new app (APPGUIDHERE)
    Set-AdminPowerAppAsFeatured -AppName APPGUIDHERE

    # To clear a hero app use Clear-AdminPowerAppAsHero
    # Change the App ID for each new app (APPGUIDHERE)
    Set-AdminPowerAppAsHero -AppName APPGUIDHERE
    ```

2.  Replace the `APPGUIDHERE` value in the script with the actual app ID for the app you want to set as featured and hero respectively.

3.  Save the file as .ps file.

4.  Run PowerShell as an administrator and execute the .ps file you just created.
 

## Step 9: Share model-driven app with admins in your organization

For your admin users to use the admin app (model-driven app), it must be shared with them. It's easier to use Azure AD groups to easily share apps with a group of admin users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the user or group you plan to share the app with *already* have access to your environment. Typically, you would have already added users or group while [setting up your environment](#step-2-sign-up-for-power-apps-and-create-an-environment). Alternatively, you can follow the steps here to add users to your environment and provide appropriate access before sharing app with them: [Create users and assign security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles).

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

2. In the left navigation pane, select Apps to view a list of all your apps.

3. Select the model-driven app (**Admin App – Emergency Response App**) and select **Share** in the banner.

4. Specify the Azure AD group or admin users that you want to share this app with, assign the **Emergency Response Admin** security role, and select **Share**.

## Step 10: Publish the Power BI dashboard

Publish the Power BI dashboard and share it with users in your organization so that they can use the dashboard for insights and decision making.

You can publish the Power BI dashboard using either of the following options: using the template app from the AppSource *or* using the **.pbit** file available in the deployment package.

### Option A: Publish using the template app from AppSource (Preferred Option)

Detailed information about using the template app from the AppSource is available here: [Connect to the Hospital Emergency Response Decision Support Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-health-emergency-response)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an easier way to publish the Power BI dashboard than using the .pbit file option to publish. We recommend customers use this option instead of publishing using the .pbit file option. 

### Option B: Publish using the .pbit file in the deployment package

This section provides information on how you can use the **Emergency Response App.pbit** file available in the deployment package to publish the dashboard.

#### Prerequisites

- Download the deployment package (.zip file) from <https://aka.ms/emergency-response-solution>. After downloading, extract the .zip file to your computer. The .pbit file will be available in the P**ower BI Template** folder

- Power BI Premium Capacity or Power BI Pro licenses assigned to users accessing the report. 

- Create a workspace in Power BI where you publish the report. Sign into Power BI and create a workspace. More information: [Create the new workspaces in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-create-the-new-workspaces)

- Install Power BI Desktop from the Windows app store: <https://aka.ms/pbidesktop>

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If you have installed Power BI Desktop by downloading directly from the Download Center page as an executable in the past, remove it and use the one from the Microsoft Store. The Microsoft Store version will be updated automatically as new releases are available.
   >
   > If you can't install from Microsoft Store, install the latest non-Microsoft Store version from the [Download Center page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494).

- After installing Power BI Desktop from app store, run it, sign in using an account that has permission to publish Power BI apps in your organization.

#### Publish the dashboard using the .pbit file

1. Navigate to the location where you extracted the deployment package. You will find the **Emergency Response App.pbit** file under the **Power BI Template** folder.

2. Open the **Emergency Response App.pbit** file in Power BI Desktop. You'll will be prompted to type the following values:

    - **Organization_name**: Type your organization name that will be populated on the top-left corner of each report page.
        > [!TIP]
        > You might want to specify a different value for **Organization_name** to identify Power BI dashboard in your test environment. For example, **Contoso Test System**.

    - **CDS_base_solution_URL**: Type the URL of your Common Data Service environment instance. For example: https://*[myenv]*.crm.dynamics.com
