# Configure data and view dashboards

This article provides information on how you can use:
- **Admin** app to add and manage master data for your solution and configure the Power BI report URL 
- **Power BI dashboard** to view key insights and metrics
- **Canvas App Label Management** app to extend mobile app labels
- **Download Data for CDC** app to download the CDC data

These tasks are typically performed by business admins in your organization.

## Configure and manage master data for your organization

Use the admin app to create and manage master data for your organization. This data is required for the Hospital Emergency Response app to work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that your IT Admin has deployed the solution in your organization and has granted appropriate permissions for business admins to use the admin app. More information: [Deploy the Hospital Emergency Response app](deploy-configure.md)

You must add master data in these entities in the following sequence:

1. [Systems](#systems-data)

1. [Regions](#regions-data)

1. [Facilities](#facilities-data)

1. [Locations](#locations-data)

1. [Departments](#departments-data)

The master data is managed from the **Locations** area in the left navigation in the admin app:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![locations-area](media/locations-area.png)

The entities under the **Hierarchy** area are listed in the order you should populate data.

> [!NOTE]
> Acuities data is automatically imported during the fresh installation of the app. More information: [Install the app](deploy-configure.md#step-3-install-the-app)

### Systems data

The **Systems** entity lets you create and manage entries for Hospital Systems. This allows you to manage multiple hospital systems within the same organization.

To create a record:

|COVID tracking|Location|
|Staff|Location|
|Equipment|Location|
|Bed capacity|Facility|
|Supplies|Facility|

    - If **Location** is selected for an app, records created using the mobile app will contain location and facility information along with other data. Additionally, a **Location** drop-down will be available in the mobile app for users to select a location to track the data.

    - If **Facility** is selected for an app, records created using the mobile app will contain only the facility information along with other data.

    - If you don't select any value for the **Tracking Level** field, the *default* tracking level as explained earlier is applied to the mobile apps.

### Enable languages for your environment

Before you can view the admin app in one of the supported languages, the languages must be enabled by the system administrator in your environment. The system administrator can perform a *one-time* configuration step to enable the required languages from one of the languages supported by the admin app.

1. Sign into [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

2. In the left pane, select **Environments**, and then select [Your Environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Languages**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![ppac-settings](media/ppac-settings.png)

3. On the **Language Settings** page, select the languages you want to enable from one of the supported languages mentioned earlier, and select **Apply** in the lower-right corner. For example, we are enabling the **French** and **German** languages.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![ppac-lang-settings](media/ppac-lang-settings.png)

4. On the **Confirm Language Change** dialog box, select **OK**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Each selected language can take several minutes to enable.

### Set the language of your choice

After the required languages are enabled by your system administrator, each admin user can select the language she/he prefers to see the admin app displayed in.

1. Sign into the admin app (model-driven app) using the URL provided by your IT admin.

2. Select the **Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then select **Personalization Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![personal-settings](media/personal-settings.png)

3. On the **Set Personal Options** page, select the **Languages** tab, and then select a language of choice from the **User Interface Language** list. The list shows all the languages enabled by your system administrator for your environment.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![select-lang](media/select-lang.png)

4. Select **OK** in the lower-right corner.

The admin app UI will switch to display in the language you selected.

### Uninstalling the Canvas App Strings solution

If you uninstall Canvas App Strings solution, the apps will continue to run, even though the entity that the app is looking for doesn't exist.

You can restore canvas apps to previous version that didn't use Canvas App Strings solution in two different ways:

1. Note the current live version of the app before you import the solution. You can restore the app to this version after you uninstall the solution. For more information: [Restore a canvas app to a previous version in Power Apps](../../maker/canvas-apps/restore-an-app.md).

1. Create a new solution and the existing apps. Export the solution as backup. If you uninstall the Canvas App Strings solution, you can import your backup solution with default apps. To learn how to add apps to solution and export, go to [Link an existing canvas app to a solution](../../maker/canvas-apps/add-app-solution.md#link-an-existing-canvas-app-to-a-solution).

### Considerations when extending mobile app labels

- Some TextIDs (labels) can be found in the **OnVisible** property of a screen as a part of a collection.
- HomeScreen, SplashScreen, FeedbackScreen, MeScreen, Buttons and the timestamp for last submitted data share the same TextIDs across apps. Other screens use separate values for TextIDs, even if the Default Text is same across apps; for example *Location*.
- Canvas App Strings solution supports the following languages: German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese,  Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil), and Turkish.
