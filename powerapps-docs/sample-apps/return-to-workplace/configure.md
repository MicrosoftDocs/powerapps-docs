# Configure the Return to the Workplace solution

This article provides step-by-step instructions to IT administrators for configuring the Return to the Workplace solution. IT administrators are responsible for making sure the facility manager can guide their facilities throughout the phases. The following steps will be covered in this article:

- [Plan reopening phases](#plan-reopening-phases)

- [Manage facilities](#manage-facilities)

- [Specify solution settings](#specify-solution-settings)

## Prerequisites

- The environment needs to have all the Return to the Workplace components in place with the model-driven apps, canvas apps, and Power BI dashboards.

## Plan reopening phases

Reopening workplaces safely requires planning in phases to ensure the safety of the employees. Within these phases, you need to define goals, metrics, and readiness factors.

In the model-driven app, you select the **Solution Setup** module, which allows you to configure the plan.

> ![Phase planning](media/solution-admin-new-setting-phase-planning.png "Phase planning")

**To define a reopen phase**

1. [Define key metrics](#define-key-metrics).

2. [Set up readiness categories](#set-up-readiness-categories).

3. [Define readiness factors](#define-readiness-factors).

4. [Set up a reopen phase](#set-up-a-reopen-phase).

5. [Set the goals and readiness factors for a phase](#set-the-goals-and-readiness-factors-for-a-phase).

## Define key metrics

By default, the solution provides and tracks five key metrics. You can define more metrics if you want. 

**To create a new key metric**

## Manage facilities

Facilities are an important part of the Return to the Workplace solution. By default, the solution includes two facility types&mdash;buildings and conference centers&mdash. The IT administrator is responsible for creating, updating the existing facility types, and importing records. 

**To manage facilities**

1. [Define facility types](#define-facility-types).

2. [Import facilities](#import-facilities).

## Define facility types

By default, two facility types are provided as an example.

**To create a new facility type**

1. Select **Facility Types** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility type](media/solution-admin-new-facility-type.png "facility type")

2. Enter appropriate values in the fields:

    | **Field**   | **Description**                     |
   |-------------|-------------------------------------|
   | Type        | Enter a name for the type of facility.    |
   | Description | Enter the description for the facility type. |

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility type form](media/solution-admin-new-facility-type-form.png "Facility type form")

3. Select **Save & Close**. The newly created record is available in the **Active Facility Types** view.

To edit the record, select it, update the values, and then select **Save & Close**.

## Import facilities

The facility sample data file is available in the package. When you want to import your own facilities, you can [download a template to use for data import](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/download-template-data-import).

**To import sample facility data to the Facility entity**

1. On the left pane, under **Facility Management**, select **Facilities**.

2. Select **Import from Excel**, and select the facilities data file.
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Import data](media/solution-admin-facilities-excel-import.png "Import data")

3. After the sample data is imported, you'll see the imported records in the entity.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Active facilities](media/solution-admin-facilities-active.png "Active facilities")

## Specify solution settings

The overall solution requires certain configurations to be made to make sure that the user has the correct information. You can use solution settings to configure your own terms of agreement, health terms of agreement, and contact email. You can also use themes to tailor the experience to your company branding.

When setting up the solution, do the following:

1. [Set solution settings](#set-solution-settings).

2. [Define a theme](#define-a-theme).

## Set solution settings

With solution settings, you define the terms of agreement that are applicable to your company. Solution settings are linked to groups or to the entire organization, which makes it possible to differentiate them for individual facilities. One solution setting will act as the default and will be applicable for every facility, which will be the solution setting that has an empty group. To set solution settings:

1. Select **Solution Settings** in the left pane, and then select **New**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Solution Settings](media/solution-admin-view-solution-settings.png)

2. Enter the appropriate values in the fields:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Solution settings form](media/solution-admin-new-setting.png "Solution settings form")

## Define a theme

You can use a theme to enhance the user experience.

1. Select **Settings**, and then select **Customizations**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Settings](media/solution-admin-settings-themes.png "Settings")

2. Under Customizations, select **Themes**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Themes](media/solution-admin-settings.png "Themes")

3. From the list, select the default theme.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![All themes](media/solution-admin-settings-all-themes.png "All themes")

4. You can select different colors from the theme.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Theme color](media/deploy-theme-colors.png "Theme color")
   
## Contoso Sample Data

To try out the solution, when installing the Return to the Workplace solution, Contoso sample data is installed with it. This sample data includes data around the entities listed below. Advised is to import or create your own data for these entities.

- Facilities
- Facility Groups
- Facility Types
- Employees
- Solution Settings

Usage sample data is generated by four flows, these need to be disabled when you are not using the Contoso sample data or when accessing the solution in a production environment.

- Sample Data - Generate Facility transitions

This flow will loop over all the facilities and randomly move a facility one phase backward or forward. By generating and approving a Reopen Phase Transition record. Prerequisites: Facility should be in active state and has a Reopen phase set.

- Sample Data - Generate Employee Records

This flow mimics employees using the app. It will create a booking, attestation, and sentiment record for the current day for each active employee. Prerequisites: Employees record should be active, have a default facility assigned and an assigned area that is part of that default facility.

- Sample Data - Create and update employee cases

This flow runs twice a day and randomly moves cases one step forward through the process. For each employee, a case is created if none exists. If a case exists, it is moved forward one step in the process. If the case reaches the **Resolved** stage, it will be closed. When moving from opening to investigation, it creates a linked case facility record based on the employees' default facility. Prerequisites: Employees records should be in active state and have a default facility selected.

- Sample Data - Visits

This flow runs twice a day and creates a visit record for each employee for their default facility. When an employee record is in active state, has a default facility assigned and an assigned area that is part of that default facility, then the visit will also be linked to a booking or attestation record.

## Bulk record deletion

Due to privacy regulations, we strongly recommend that you create bulk record-delete jobs to delete personal data after a certain period.

**To create bulk record-delete jobs**

1.	Select **Settings**, and then select **Data Management**

2.	Under **Data Management**, select **Bulk record deletion**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Data Management](media/solution-admin-dm.png "Data Management")

3.	Select **New**.

4.	Go through the **Bulk Deletion Wizard**.

5.	Select the appropriate **entity** and **criteria**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Criteria](media/solution-admin-criteria.png "Criteria")

6.	Add a name and a schedule for the bulk record-delete job to run.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Bulk record delete job](media/solution-admin-brd.png "Bulk record delete job")

7.	Submit the bulk record-delete job.
