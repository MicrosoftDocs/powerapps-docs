# Deploy the Return to the Workplace solution

This article provides step-by-step instructions to IT administrators for deploying the Return to the Workplace solution.

Estimated time to complete these steps: 60&ndash;90 minutes

## Prerequisites

- You should be a Global administrator or Microsoft Power Platform administrator to perform the installation.

- You must be a Global administrator and must have a Power BI Pro license to configure and publish reports.

- Sign in to Power BI and create a workspace to publish the report. More information: [Create the new workspaces in Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces) and [Share the workspace with others](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces#give-access-to-your-workspace)

## Step 1: Sign up for Power Apps and create an environment

Sign up for [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/signup-for-powerapps-admin) if you don't have it already, and purchase an appropriate license. More information: [Power Apps pricing](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/)

After you've purchased Power Apps, create an environment with a Common Data Service database.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

2. Create a Common Data Service environment with a database. More information: [Create and manage environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you select a security group for the database while you're creating it, the apps can be shared only with users who are members of the security group.

3. Create appropriate users, and assign security roles. More information: [Create users and assign security roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles)

After you've created your environment, you can access it by using the following URL: `https://[myenv].crm.dynamics.com`, where [myenv] is the name of your environment. Make a note of this environment URL.

## Step 2: Install the package

You can install the Return to the Workplace solution by from Microsoft AppSource. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a US Government customer, you'll have to install using the deployment package available on GitHub. More information: [Appendix: Deploy the app and publish Power BI dashboard (US Government customers only)](#appendix-deploy-the-app-and-publish-power-bi-dashboard-us-government-customers-only).

1. Go to [AppSource](https://aka.ms/rtw-app) to install the **Return to the Workplace solution**.

## Step 3: Configure and publish Power BI dashboards

The Return to the Workplace solution has two Power BI dashboards, one for executive leadership and one for facility managers. You can publish the Power BI dashboards by using the template app from AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are a US Government customer, you'll have to publish Power BI dashboards using the deployment package available on GitHub. More information: [Appendix: Deploy the app and publish Power BI dashboard (US Government customers only)](#appendix-deploy-the-app-and-publish-power-bi-dashboard-us-government-customers-only).

### Install the template app for dashboards

1. Go to AppSource to install [Return to the Workplace – Location Readiness](https://aka.ms/rtw-leadershippbi) and [Return to the Workplace - Location Management](https://aka.ms/rtw-facilitypbi) dashboards. 

2. Select **GET IT NOW** to install the solution in your environment.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![GET IT NOW](media/deploy-install-get-it-now.png "GET IT NOW")

    You're directed to an agreement pop-up window. Select **Continue** if you agree to the terms.

3. Sign in to Power BI, and then select **Install**.

### Connect to data sources

1. Select the icon on your Apps page to open the app.

2. On the splash screen, select **Connect**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Connect](media/deploy-connect-data-source.png "Connect")

3. Enter the URL of the Common Data Service environment (for example, https://[myenv].crm.dynamics.com), and then select **Next**.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Common Data Service environment name](media/deploy-connect-CDS.png "Common Data Service environment name")

4. Determine where the displayed URL is pointing to in the Common Data Service environment:

    - If it's pointing to Common Data Service, set the **Authentication method** to **Microsoft account** and set **Privacy level setting for this data source** to **Organizational**. Select **Sign in**.
    - If it's not pointing to Common Data Service, set the **Authentication method** to **Anonymous** and set **Privacy level setting for this data source** to **Public**. Select **Sign in**
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Privacy](media/deploy-privacy-level.png "Privacy")

After you've configured your data sources, the report will be populated with your data. Repeat these steps for both dashboards.

Next, we'll configure the data refresh settings for the dataset.

## Step 4: Schedule report refresh

1. On the **Datasets** tab of your workspace, select **Schedule refresh** for the dataset of your report.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Report available in the workspace](media/deploy-schedule-refresh-dataset.png "Report available in the workspace")

2. The first time you try to schedule data refresh, the **Settings** page displays a message that your credentials aren't valid. Under **Data source credentials**, select **Edit credentials** to specify your credentials.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Update your credentials](media/deploy-schedule-refresh-edit-credentials.png "Update your credentials")

3. On the next screen for the Common Data Service data source, do the following:

      - For **Authentication method**, select **Microsoft account**.

      - For **Privacy level setting for this data source**, select **Organizational**.

      - Select **Sign in**.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
        > ![Configure Common Data Service data source credentials](media/deploy-schedule-refresh-cds-credentials.png "Configure Common Data Service data source credentials")

      You'll be prompted to specify your credentials and sign in. After you've successfully signed in, you'll return to the **Settings** page.

      For all other data sources, do the following:
      - For **Authentication method**, select **Anonymous**.

      - For **Privacy level setting for this data source**, select **Public**.

      - Select **Sign in**.

          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
          > ![Configure other data source credentials](media/deploy-schedule-refresh-web-credentials.png "Configure other data source credentials")

4. On the **Settings** page, expand **Scheduled refresh**, and then specify the schedule you want for refreshing data. Select **Apply**.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
      > ![Schedule refresh data](media/deploy-schedule-refresh.png "Schedule refresh data")

      > [!NOTE]
      > - There are limits to how many times data can be refreshed. Power BI limits datasets on shared capacity to eight daily refreshes. If the dataset resides on a Power BI Premium capacity node, you can schedule up to 48 refreshes per day in the dataset settings. More information: [Refresh data](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/refresh-data#data-refresh)
      >- We recommend scheduling data to be refreshed every 30 minutes.

5. Go back to your workspace, select the **Reports** tab, and then select the report to open it in a browser.

## Step 5: Embed the Power BI report in the model-driven app

The facility manager Power BI dashboard is used in the model-driven app. Because these reports are published in a different location, you need to change the location.

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

2. Select the correct environment, and then select **Settings**.

3. Select **Product** > **Feature**, turn on the **Power BI visualization embedding** toggle, and then select **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Enable Power BI](media/deploy-settings-admin1.png "Enable Power BI")

4. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com), select **Solutions** in the left pane, and create a new solution. After opening the solution, select **Add existing**, and then select **Entity**. From the list of entities, select **Facility** > **select components**, under the **Forms** tab, select **Main - Information Form**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility form](media/deploy-new-facility-form.png "Facility form")

5. Export the solution, unpack the solution, and then apply the changes in the form XML listed in this article: [Embed a Power BI report in a model-driven system form](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/embed-powerbi-report-in-system-form). Pack the solution, reimport the solution, and then select **Publish all customizations**.

For ease of implementation, you can also use the [Power BI Embedder](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/plugins/Fic.XTB.PowerBiEmbedder/) in XRMToolBox.

## Step 6: Publish a theme

You can change the look and feel of the app by applying themes to match your company branding.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Customizations](media/deploy-settings-customizations.png "Customizations")

2. Select **Themes**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select themes](media/deploy-settings-solutions.png "Select themes")

3. Select **New**. Enter the **Name** and determine which colors you want to use. You can also specify the logo, which is used in the site map.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Deploy themes](media/deploy-themes.png "Deploy themes")

4. Select **Save**, and then **Publish**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sample theme](media/deploy-theme-colors.png "Sample theme")

## Step 7: Share the canvas app to users

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Select the **Environment** from the upper-right corner.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Share app](media/deploy-share-app.png "Share app")

5. Select users from the list of available users with whom you want to share the app.

## Step 8: Set the security roles

In the Return to the Workplace solution, the following security roles are defined:

- Return to the Workplace - Employee, which is used to check in and look at the details of a location.

- Return to the Workplace - Facility Manager, which is used to look at facilities and plan phasing.
