# Extend the Return to the Workplace solution

This article provides a detailed description of the data model, workflows, and Power Automate flows used by the Return to the Workplace solution. The solution extends Common Data Model and uses several of its components. Administrators, developers, and users should be mindful of the solution and possible implications of other solutions that coexist in the same environment.

The definitions provided in this article indicate the intended purpose of the entities, relationships, attributes, flows, and workflows contained in the Return to the Workplace solution. These definitions can be fully or partially adopted depending on your business requirements.

## Integration and extension

Return to the Workplace solution is built on Microsoft Power Platform. To learn more about working with model-driven apps and Common Data Service, go to:

- [Model-driven apps guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview)
- [Common Data Service developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/overview)
- [Common Data Service entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/entities)
- [Work with data using code in Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/work-with-data-cds)
- [Best practices and guidance for Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/best-practices/)
- [Business process flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/business-process-flows-overview)

To learn more about solutions and application lifecycle management (ALM) guidance to maintain the solution integrity, go to:

- [Introduction to solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/introduction-solutions)
- [ALM with Microsoft Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/)

To learn more about supported extension methods, go to:

- [Get started with model-driven apps customizations using code](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/supported-customizations)

## Guidance

With the solution there are numerous parts which can be extended. Below are a couple of components where we give some additional guidance to customize or tailor them.

### Canvas App

The canvas app within the solution can be tailored to your own needs. Advised when doing so, is to copy the canvas app. This way your changes aren't impacted by new changes. In order to copy the canvas app:

1. Go to the Maker Portal (https://make.powerapps.com)
2. Select App and **Edit** the **Employee Return to the Workplace** app.
3. Select **File** and the press **Save As**. Select a new location and name and then press **Save**.

### Security Roles

The security roles included in this solution are setup for test and demo purposes. They must be reviewed and understood thouroughly before moving to a production environment or when loading sensitive data.

To learn more about the Power Platform and Common Data Service Security, see:

- [Security in Common Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-security)
- [Security Roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

New security roles can be created and tailerod to your needs. The supplied security roles can serve as template here that can be copied. If the new roles need to be moved to different environments, they need to be added to a new solution.

In order to copy the security role:

1. Open the **Settings**.
2. Select **Settings** and then **Security**.
3. Select **Security Roles**.
4. Select the role you want to copy.
5. Click **More actions** and select **Copy Role...**.

## Entity relationship diagram

The entity relationship diagram illustrates the entities and their relationships that are present in the Common Data Service environment. System-generated entities and relationships, such as **Created By** and **Modified By**, aren't displayed in the diagram.
