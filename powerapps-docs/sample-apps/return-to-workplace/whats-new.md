will be next available for the affected employee and provide them instructions

-   **Prioritized case view**

A new view for case managers has been introduced to help them prioritize their
case workload. They can view the list of high-risk cases and cases due for
contact and investigation. They can also visualize cases by duration they have
been open and by their risk.

### Workplace care management dashboard

-   **View and assess case clusters**

Health and safety leaders can visualize case clusters and view associated
metrics to assess risk of an outbreak and take immediate actions. The core data
for visualizations is sourced from the manual contact tracing feature in the
workplace care management app

### Workplace care management dashboard

-   **\*New\* dashboard for health and safety leaders**

With this update, we are introducing a new Microsoft Power BI dashboard for
health and safety leaders that are authorized to view employee cases across the
organization. The dashboard provides an overview of all cases with filters to
view specific locations. There are also focused reports for viewing cases under
investigation and cases being monitored to ensure health and safety and task
force leadership have a comprehensive and consolidated view.

### Facility safety management app

-   **Partition facility and set capacity limits**

We are introducing a new Location Management capability designed to enable
companies to better manage facility occupancy and arrivals, ensuring effective
social distancing. Facility managers can partition workspace into floors and
areas based on adjusted designs and establish capacity limits for each. Area
capacity can also be limited by phase. These limits establish how many passes
can be issued daily to ensure adherence to safety constraints. 

### Facility management dashboard

-   **\*New\* occupancy tab**

The new occupancy tab enables a facility manager to monitor and manage occupancy
by comparing bookings and visits against capacity. The facility manager can view
trends by time and drill down to a floor and an area level to identify the high
occupancy spaces.

-   **\*New\* Daily Arrivals tab**

This tab shows booking information to assist a facility manager in controlling
the facility traffic, such as bookings by day of the week and by arrival time
window
