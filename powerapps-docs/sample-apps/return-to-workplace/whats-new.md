# What's new in the Return to the Workplace solution?

This article provides resources where you can learn about the new features that have recently released.

## New and updated features in October 2020 (v1.2)

### Guest bookings 

To support guest visits to a facility, employees can now book passes for their guests. Passes can be shared to guests through email (Outlook), so that guests are aware of policies and details of the facility. More information: [Employee app](app-for-employee.md).

### QR code 

Employees and guest pass now contains QR code that enable integration with health and safety systems, such as temperature scanning and badge reader systems. Depending on your preferences, you can turn off this feature in the solution settings. More information: [Employee app](app-for-employee.md).

### Manual contact tracing 

Manual contact tracing can quickly identify case contacts through a suggested list, and manually add additional case contacts. The case contacts can be evaluated and new cases can be opened, if needed. More information: [Workplace Care Management app](app-for-health-and-safety-lead.md).

### Employee access management 

Case managers can now manage facility access like blocking employees entering into the facility. When blocking the employee, you can provide a notification to the employee when the employee is trying to book a facility. Case managers can also set the date when facility access will be available again for the  employee. More information: [Workplace Care Management app](app-for-health-and-safety-lead.md)

### Prioritized case dashboard 

A new dashboard for case managers has been introduced to help them prioritize their case workload. Case managers can view the list of high-risk cases and cases due for contact and investigation. Case managers can also visualize cases by duration they have been open and by their risk. More information: [Workplace Care Management app](app-for-health-and-safety-lead.md).

### View and assess case clusters 

Health and safety leads can visualize case clusters and view associated metrics to assess the risk of an outbreak and take immediate actions. The core data for visualizations is sourced from the manual contact tracing feature. More information: [Use the Workplace Care Management dashboard](dashboard-case-management.md).

### Contact type 

Contacts are now differentiated by a new contact type field (Employee and Guest) that enables a facility manager to differentiate between an employee and non-employee. More information: [Facility Safety Management app](app-for-facility-manager.md).

### Enhanced occupancy dashboards

### New dashboard for health and safety leads

With this update, we are introducing a new Microsoft Power BI dashboard for health and safety leads that is authorized to view employee cases across the organization. The dashboard provides an overview of all cases with filters to view specific locations. There are also focused reports for viewing cases under investigation and cases being monitored to ensure health and safety and task force leadership have a comprehensive and consolidated view.

### Partition facility and set capacity limits 

A new location management capability designed to enable companies to better manage facility occupancy and arrivals, ensuring effective social distancing. Facility managers can partition workspace into floors and areas based on adjusted designs and establish capacity limits for each. Area capacity can also be limited by phase. These limits establish how many passes can be issued daily to ensure adherence to safety constraints. More information: [Facility Safety Management app](app-for-facility-manager.md).

### New occupancy tab 

The new occupancy tab enables a facility manager to monitor and manage occupancy by comparing bookings and visits against capacity. The facility manager can view trends by time and drill down to a floor and an area level to identify the high occupancy spaces. More information: [Facility Management dashboard](dashboard-for-executive-leadership.md).
