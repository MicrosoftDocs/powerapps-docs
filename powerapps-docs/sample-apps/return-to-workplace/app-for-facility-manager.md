# Use the Facility Safety Management app

The Facility Safety Management app provides step-by-step instructions to facility managers in the organization for using the app to manage the reopening and readiness of the facilities. 

This helps the organizations ensure that they can provide a safe working environment for employees to return to the workplace using the Return to the Workplace solution.

## App at a glance

The left pane lists all the components available in the **Facility Management** area.

> ![Facility management](media/facility-manager-facility-active-facilities.png "Facility management")

## App components

The Facility Safety Management app has the following components:

**Facility Management**

-  **Facilities**- List of the facilities (for example, buildings and plants) that require monitoring to reopen.

-  **Facility Groups** - Provides a flexible way to group facilities. For example, by campus or geographical region.

**Reopen Readiness**

-  **Phase Transitions** - A phase transition is used to create a request to transition to a new phase. When the transition is approved, the facility will be updated with the proposed phase.

-  **Readiness Factors** -  Readiness factors are yes-or-no questions about reopening a building. They are linked to the reopening phase by a checklist on a facility.

- **Measurements** -  The actual values for a metric to help track parameters over time. For a single metric, measurements can be entered for each facility.

**Employee**

- **Employee Sentiment** -  Keeps track of general employee well-being. This is self-reported information, but it's a valuable parameter when tracked consistently over time and with bigger groups. This data is typically entered by employees using the employee app.

- **Employee Attestation** - Keeps track of employee health assessments or attestations based on a series of questions answered by the employee. This data is typically entered by employees using the employee app.

## Manage and monitor facilities 

This section covers how to manage and monitor facilities.

### Monitor a facility

The facility manager can monitor and assesses the current status of their facilities
by reviewing the facility's associated dashboard, details, checklist, and
transitions.

**To monitor a facility**

1. Select **Facility** from the left pane. The default view, My Facilities, shows only your facilities. When switching views, you can see either all active or inactive facilities. 

2. Select the facility record for which you want to access data. The **General** tab shows the facility manager dashboard. The dashboard shows the COVID-19 data based on the address details of the facility, checklist completion for the current phase, employee attestation, and employee sentiment. More information: [Power BI dashboard](dashboard-for-executive-leadership.md).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility at a glance](media/facility-manager-facility-at-glance1.png "Facility at a glance")

3. Select the **Details** tab for the facility.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select details ](media/facility-manager-facility-form-populated.png "Select details")

   - Select the **Checklist** tab to see checklist items and their completion status.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Checklist items](media/facility-manager-checklist-2-1.png "Checklist items") 

   - Select the **Transitions** tab to see any related transition requests and their status.

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
     > ![Facility transition](media/facility-manager-facility-transitions.png "Facility transition")

### Updating the checklist

The **Checklist** tab contains an editable grid displaying the checklist for the current facility or phase combination. The editable grid provides an easy way for to find checklist items by category and then update the individual items, where applicable. 

**To find and update checklist items**

1. Select **Facilities** from the left pane.

2. Select the facility for which you want to find and update checklist items.

3. Select the **Checklist** tab.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Checklist items and status](media/facility-manager-checklist-2-1.png "Checklist items and status")

4. Select **Category**, and then select the category you want to search
    in.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Category drop-down list](media/facility-manager-categories-droplist1.png "Category drop-down list")

5. Select the drop-down and select **Yes** to confirm the check is completed. 

6. Add the date in the **Completion date** column, and then select **Save** to update the checklist.

    > ![Update the completion date for a checklist item](media/facility-manager-facility-completed-check1.png "Update the completion date for a checklist item")

## Moving facility to a new phase

When a facility manager asserts that a facility should be moved to a new phase, the manager can apply for a transition. Only the facility manager can create
a new transition record that indicates the new phase. After the transition is saved, a reviewer can be assigned. A reviewer must **Accept** or **Reject** the transition. Either way, the transition record is closed and stored as a historical record. When the transition is accepted, the proposed phase is applied to the facility.

The new phase comes with its own checklist and set of metrics and goals. These will be made available on the facility by a background process. So there will be
a small delay between accepting a transition and the actual changes on the facility record.

A reviewer&mdash;for instance, a facility manager supervising many facility managers in a facility group&mdash;can find the backlog in **Phase transitions**. For example, the list can be filtered by the facility group or by the reviewer to find the phase transitions that require attention.

> ![Open phase transitions](media/facility-manager-open-phase-transitions.png "Open phase transitions")

### Create a transition request

1. Select **Facilities** in the left pane, and select a facility record from the active facilities list.

2. Select the **Transitions** tab. If any existing or previous transition request were established, they'll appear in the subgrid.

3. Select **New Reopen Phase Transition**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![New reopen phase transition](media/facility-manager-reopen-phase-transition-subgrid.png "New reopen phase transition")

4. Enter appropriate values in the fields:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Phase transition form](media/facility-manager-phase-transition-form.png "Phase transition form")

   | **Field**    | **Description**    |
   |-----------------------|---------------|
   | Proposed Reopen Phase | Select the next reopen phase you want to transition to.|
   | Summary | Enter the summary information about moving to the next or targeted reopen phase. |
   | Reviewer | Select appropriate resources to review and approve the new transition. |

5. Select **Save & Close**. The newly created record is available in the **Transitions** tab subgrid for the facility.

To edit the record, select it, update the values, and then select **Save & Close**. After the phase transition is approved or rejected, the record can't be updated.

### Approve or reject a transition

1. Select **Phase Transitions** in the left pane.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Phase transition](media/facility-manager-phase-transition-reopen-transitions.png "Phase transition")

2. Filter the transitions by name on the **Reviewer** column.

3. Select the **Transition** record. Complete any analysis required before selecting **Approved** or **Rejected** in the **Review Status** field.

4. For approvals, select **Approved** and enter any comments in the **Review Comments** field. Select **Save & Close**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Approved transitions](media/facility-manager-phase-transition-form-approved.png  "Approve transitions")

5. For rejections, select **Rejected** and enter any comments in the **Review Comments** field. Select **Save & Close**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Rejected transitions](media/facility-manager-phase-transition-form-rejected.png "Rejected transitions")

The review status for the transition is updated, and appropriate back-end processes are triggered to move the facility to the targeted reopen phase.


## Monitor employee attestations

Facility managers can monitor whether their organization's employees are
feeling healthy enough to be eligible to return to their facility. They can track employee self-attestations of their health based on a series of
questions the employees answer. This data is typically entered by the employee using the employee app. Facility managers can view the summary of the responses in the **Employee Attestations** area of the facility manager app.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Employee Attestations](media/facility-manager-employee-attestations.png "Employee Attestations")

## Monitor employee sentiments

This area of the facility manager app keeps track of general employee sentiment about the prospect of returning to their workplace. This information is
self-reported, but it's a valuable parameter when tracked
consistently over time and with bigger groups. This data is typically entered by the employee using the employee app. Facility managers can view the summary of the responses in the **Employee Attestations** area of the facility manager app.
