## Overview page

The overview page is the default page of the dashboard that provides an overall visibility into key metrics and trends related to employee cases. The key metrics include: 

- Total Active Cases: Number of active cases.

- Cases per case manager: Average number of active cases (in open, investigating, and monitoring phase) per case manager.

- Days without New Cases: Number of days for which a new case has not been opened at a facility.

- Average Risk: Average case risk associated with a facility or group of facilities.

- Average Resolution Time: Days needed to resolve cases.

The interactive map displays the active cases by stage and by location. The size of the bubble represents the number of cases. The Case Manager Overview table contains information about number of cases, average risk, and average resolution time (days).
