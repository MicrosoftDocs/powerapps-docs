# Use the Workplace Care Management dashboard

This article is for health and safety leads who use the Power BI dashboard to gain awareness of employee well-being, and effectively manage and track employee cases across their network of facilities and locations, by using the Return to the Workplace solution.

## How to view the Workplace Care Management dashboard

1. Open Power BI Desktop.

2. In the search bar, search for Return to Workplace – **Care management**.

## Overview page

The overview page is the default page of the dashboard that provides overall visibility into key metrics and trends related to employee cases. The key metrics include:

- Total active cases: Number of active cases.

- Cases per case manager: Average number of active cases (in open, investigating, and monitoring phases) per case manager.

- Days without new cases: Number of days since a new case hasn't been opened at a facility.

- Average risk: Average case risk associated with a facility or group of facilities.

- Average resolution time: Days needed to resolve cases.

The interactive map displays the active cases by stage and location. The size of the bubble represents the number of cases. The case manager overview table contains information about the number of cases, average risk, and average resolution time in days.

## Investigating page

The Investigating page provides a detailed view of active cases being investigated with a set of key metrics important for that stage. Key metrics include:

- Cases being investigated: The number of cases being investigated.

- Contacts reached: Number of employees that have been reached out of all employee cases under investigation.

- Time to start investigating: Average time taken from opening a case to starting an investigation.

- Time to reach a contact: Average time taken from opening a case to contacting an employee.

- Cases per case manager: Average number of cases under investigation per case manager.

The interactive map displays the location of cases in the investigating stage. You can drill into the data by country, province, and facility. The size of the bubble represents the number of cases. 

The case manager overview table contains information about number of cases, case manager, time to start investigating, and time to reach a contact.

## Monitoring page 

The Monitoring page focuses on active cases that are in the monitoring stage. Key metrics include:

- Cases being monitored: Number of cases being monitored.

- Avg resolution time (days): Average time taken for a case from being opened to resolved.

- Cases per case manager: Average number of cases in the monitoring phase per case manager.

- Resolved cases: Total number of cases already resolved.

The interactive map displays the location of cases in the monitoring phase. You can drill into the data by country, province, and facility. The size of the bubble represents the number of cases. The case manager overview table contains information about the number of cases, case manager, average resolution time, and variance from average.

## Slicers

Slicers help you quickly "slice and dice" the data, focusing only on data points you're interested in. You can filter all three pages by the case creation date and their groups of facilities and locations, down to the level of a single facility. 
<!--note from Renee: I revised this to be closer to the same section on the Location Readiness dashboard page.-->
