The main modules of the Return to the Workplace solution include:

- **Location Readiness dashboard** helps determine the readiness of the facilities and efficiently manage their safe reopening. Facility managers and task force leaders can use the Location Readiness dashboard to quickly make informed decisions by using critical factors like COVID-19 infection rates and the availability of supplies.

- **Facility Safety Management** gives facility managers the tools they need to manage the reopening and readiness of the facilities. This helps organizations ensure that they can provide a safe working environment for employees to return to the workplace.

- **Workplace Care Management** gives health and safety leaders the tools they need to actively manage COVID-19 cases, identify hot spots for safety improvement, and import data from contact tracing systems to determine exposure. The **Workplace Care Management dashboard** enables monitoring of all the data from the Workplace Care Management app.

- **Employee Return to the Workplace** offers your workforce the self-service tool that they need to feel confident about returning and remain productive while onsite. They can use Employee Return to the Workplace to check in to work remotely and self-screen before entering a building.
