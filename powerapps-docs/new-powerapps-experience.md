# Create apps, data, and plans together

The new workspace experience in Power Apps combines plans, data models, and apps in a single design surface, enabling you to design the app, data model, and requirements together. It reduces context switching and keeps you focused. Key capabilities:

- **Design everything together**: Create the app, plan, and data model in a single, seamless process
- **Build faster with AI**: Iterate and prototype through chat, from idea to a working app
- **One-click app generation**: Modern web apps are created from your requirements and data

## Prerequisites

- Copilot must be enabled in the tenant and environment. Learn more: [Copilot in Power Apps overview](maker/canvas-apps/ai-overview.md).

- This capability is available only in the US region and in English only. Learn more in [Explore Copilot features by geography and languages](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com/en-US/availability-reports/?report=copilotfeaturereport).

1. Data starts as in-memory draft tables. You can iterate on your data model and app without committing to any data source for rapid prototyping. And when you're ready to publish your data, you can choose between publishing as Dataverse tables or as SharePoint lists.

1. The initial save action stores the app, tables, and plan together in the preferred solution.
