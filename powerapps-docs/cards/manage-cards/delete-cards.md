# Delete a card

To delete a card, you need to be the app owner. An administrator, such as Global admin, Microsoft Entra Global admin, or Dynamics 365 admin can't delete card.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. From the [left navigation](../../maker/canvas-apps/intro-maker-portal.md#1--left-navigation-pane), select **Cards**.  
1. Select the card that you want to delete and on the command bar select, **Delete**.
