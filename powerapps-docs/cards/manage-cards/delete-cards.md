# Delete a card

[!INCLUDE[cards-deprecation-banner](~/includes/cards-deprecation-notice.md)]

To delete a card, you need to be the app owner. An admin can't delete a card.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. From the [left navigation](../../maker/canvas-apps/intro-maker-portal.md#1--left-navigation-pane), select **Cards**.  
1. Select the card that you want to delete and on the command bar select, **Delete**.
