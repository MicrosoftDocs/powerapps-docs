# Send a card automatically with a flow 

Use Power Automate to send cards for Power Apps from a flow. By setting up a flow that is triggered by an event, you can automate the process of sending cards in Teams. For instance, you can create a flow that requests the assigned individual to approve or reject an expense when a new record is added to Dataverse. Alternatively, you can create a flow that sends a daily status update in Teams every morning.

You can use **Send from a flow** option in **Send** menu on the card's **Play** page to launch a Power Automate flow template for sending cards in Teams. You can modify and save this template as a new flow to post your card in Teams chat or channel or send it to a specific Teams user.

## Prerequisites

- [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com) account
- Create a [card](../tutorials/hello-world-card.md)
- The [Power Apps Teams app](send-card-in-teams.md#add-power-apps-to-teams) installed in the chat, group chat, or channel that the card will be sent to

## Use Cards for Power Apps connector in Power Automate

The **Cards for Power Apps** connector is used to create instances of cards to send using a flow. The connector has no triggers and two actions:

- **Create card instance** - Enables the user to select a specific card to create an instance of with customizable input variables. Returns the card instance as `Card` dynamic content.
- **Get the card description** - Returns information about a user-specified card, including the ID, environmentId, name, description, author, etc.

## Managing your flow in a solution

For more details on managing your flow that uses the Card for Power Apps Connector, see [Manage cards in solutions](../manage-cards/manage-cards.md).

## Common issues and resolutions

1. If your card doesn't have any input variables, it will show an empty body parameter after selecting a card to create an instance of. You can ignore that parameter and continue building your flow.
