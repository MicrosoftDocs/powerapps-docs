# Power Apps cards overview

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Power Apps cards are micro-apps with enterprise data and workflows and interactive, lightweight UI elements that other applications can use as content. Because they're part of the Power Apps ecosystem, cards can add business logic through Power Fx and integration with business data through Power Platform connectors. Using cards, you can quickly build and share rich, actionable apps without any coding or IT expertise.

## Get started with cards

You can create cards with just a few clicks. There are no complex systems or services to deploy and maintain.

To get started, sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Select **Cards (preview)**, and then select **+ Create a card**.

There are two key components of a card:

- **Card designer**: The interface in which you create cards using drag-and-drop controls, Power Fx logic, and data from Power Platform connectors

- **Power Apps data and resource management**: The services that manage sending and receiving cards with embedded data and workflows

### Drag and drop UI elements in the card designer

With the drag-and-drop card designer, add buttons, tables, labels, images, check boxes, text boxes, and many other controls to your cards, all without writing a single line of code.

### Add data and services with connectors

Power Platform connectors incorporate enterprise data and cloud-based services in your cards safely and securely.

### Build business logic with actions and calculations

Use Power Fx to add inline calculations, dynamic actions, and data operations and assign them to interactive UI elements in your cards.
