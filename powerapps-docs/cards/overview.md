# Cards for Power Apps overview

Power Apps cards are micro-apps with enterprise data and workflows and interactive, lightweight UI elements that other applications can use as content. Because they're part of the Power Apps ecosystem, cards can add business logic through Power Fx and integration with business data through Power Platform connectors. Using cards, you can quickly build and share rich, actionable apps without any coding or IT expertise.

## Get started with cards

You can create cards with just a few clicks. There are no complex systems or services to deploy and maintain.

To get started, sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Select **Cards**, and then select **+ Create a card**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

### Drag and drop UI elements in the card designer

With the drag-and-drop card designer, add buttons, tables, labels, images, check boxes, text boxes, and many other controls to your cards, all without writing a single line of code.
