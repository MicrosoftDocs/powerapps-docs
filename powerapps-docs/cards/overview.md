# What are cards?

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Cards are a low-code capability of Power Apps that let you design, send, and use cards. Cards are micro-apps with embedded enterprise data and workflows that can be sent as content in other applications.

Use the Power Apps guided and visual interface to create cards to optimize and automate business tasks. Use them to create actionable scenarios with interactive, data-driven, lightweight UI elements; then, make them available for other people to use.

As a part of the Power Apps ecosystem, cards add business logic through Power Fx and integration with business data through Power Platform connectors.

Using cards, you can quickly build, manage, and share rich, actionable UI cards without any coding or IT expertise.

## Get started with cards

Cards are available to makers as a part of Power Apps. You can sign into [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and create your card with a few clicks; there are no complex systems or services to deploy and maintain.

To create a card, go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and select **Cards (preview)** then **+ Create a card**.

There are two key parts of any card:

- **Card Designer**: A low-code designer for creating new cards using drag-and-drop controls, Power Fx logic, and data from Power Platform connectors

- **Power Apps data and resource management**: Manages sending and receiving cards with embedded data and workflows

## Card Designer

Use the drag-and-drop designer to create a card consisting of buttons, tables, text, images, checkboxes, input fields, containers, and a variety of other types of elements, all without writing any code.

### Add data and connect to services with connectors

Add Power Platform connectors to work with enterprise data and invoke cloud-based functions safely and securely in your cards.

Each card securely handles tokens for each participant in the card transaction, enabling data-rich and powerful scenarios that respect security boundaries within an organization.

### Build business logic with actions and calculations

Use Power Fx to add inline calculations and dynamic actions to cards. Create powerful actions, including data operations, and assign them to interactive UI elements in the card.

## Post cards on Teams

Post cards on Teams to share them with other people by using the **Send** button in the Designer and copying the link into a Teams chat or channel.

## Lightweight runtime

Each interactive card runs securely, with embedded data and workflows. Users do not need to a secondary bot service or other apps to send and receive cards
