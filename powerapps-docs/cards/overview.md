# Cards for Power Apps overview

Power Apps cards are micro-apps with enterprise data, workflows, and interactive, lightweight UI elements that other applications can use as content. Because cards are part of the Power Apps ecosystem, they can add business logic through Power Fx and integration with business data through Power Platform connectors. Using cards, you can quickly build and share rich, actionable apps without any coding or IT expertise.

## Get started with cards

You can create cards with just a few steps. There are no complex systems or services to deploy and maintain.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select **... More** in the navigation menu.
1. Select **Cards**. You see **Cards** added to your navigation menu. You can pin  **Cards** to leave it in your navigation menu permanently.
1. Select **New card**, then add a **Card name** and **Card description**.

### Drag and drop UI elements in the card designer

With the drag-and-drop card designer, you can add buttons, tables, labels, images, check boxes, text boxes, and many other controls to your cards. You don't need to write a single line of code.

Use the **Input** dropdown menu to add elements to your card. In this example, you see a text input, date picker, and button added.

### Add data and services with connectors

Power Platform connectors incorporate enterprise data and cloud-based services in your cards safely and securely.

### Build business logic with actions and calculations

Use Power Fx to add inline calculations, dynamic actions, and data operations and assign them to interactive UI elements in your cards.

For example, you can type your  name into a text input control, then press a button to add (with the **Set** function) that name to a text label, saying "Hello, My Name".

### Share cards in Teams

To share your cards with others, send cards from the card designer to a Microsoft Teams chat or channel. These sharing options are found when you play the app.
