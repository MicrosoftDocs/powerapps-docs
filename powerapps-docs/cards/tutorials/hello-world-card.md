# Create a simple card (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cards_preview_notice](../includes/preview-include.md)]

In this tutorial, you'll create a card that asks the user to enter their name, and then shows the name in the title of the card. You'll use the [card designer](../make-a-card/designer-overview.md), [variables](../make-a-card/variables/variables.md), and [Power Fx](../make-a-card/power-fx/intro-to-pfx.md).

## Prerequisites

- A [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) account

## Create a card

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and select your environment.

1. In the left pane, select **Cards (preview)**.

1. Select **+ Create a card**.

1. Under **Card name**, type *HelloWorldCard*, and then select **Create**.

## Ask for text input

1. Select the text **Add and remove element to customize your new card.**, and then select the **Remove** icon (**X**) to delete it.

1. In the left pane, select **Insert**.
1. In the tool pane, select **Input** to expand the category, and then select **Text input**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/hello-world-card/text-input-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the card designer tool pane with input controls shown and the Text input control highlighted.":::

1. In the text input properties pane, set **Label** to *What's your name?*.

## Assign variables

1. In the text input properties pane, set **Name** to *UserAnswer*.

    We're giving the text input control the name of a variable that we're going to associate with the user's input.

   > [!TIP]
   > Give your variables descriptive and unique names to make them easier to use in Power Fx expressions.

   We need another variable to add the user's input to the card title, so let's create one now.

1. In the left pane, select **Variables**.
1. Select **+ New variable**.
1. In the **New variable** window, enter *UserName* under **Name** and enter *No Name* under **Default value**. Leave the other values as they are.
1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/hello-world-card/new-variable-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the variable properties pane.":::

1. Select the card title, which is a text label control. In the control's properties pane, set **Text** to *="Hello " & UserName*.

   This expression changes the card title to the string "Hello " followed by the value of the variable you created. You can enter the expression in the formula bar or the properties pane.

## Add a Power Fx button

1. In the left pane, select **Insert**.
1. In the tool pane, select **Input** to expand the category, and then select **Button**.
1. In the button properties pane, set **Title** to *Say Hello*.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/hello-world-card/rename-button-title.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the named button properties pane and the button in the card.":::

1. In the properties pane, select **PowerFx** to place your cursor in the formula bar.
1. Type the following Power Fx expression in the formula bar: *Set(UserName, UserAnswer)*

   This expression assigns the value of the user's input, `UserAnswer`, to the `UserName` variable you referred to in the card title, when the button is selected. Another way to read the expression is, "Set the value of the variable UserName equal to the value of UserAnswer." Since the expression is bound to the button's **OnSelect** property, it runs when the user selects the button.

## Test the card

You should always save your changes before you play a card. Select **Save**, and then select **Play**.

Test your card a few times with different inputs. Make sure your input replaces the default value "No Name" in the card title each time.
