# Media control in cards

Displays a media player for audio or video content. A video or audio file is specified by its Url and MimeType in the Sources tab. The media control supports publicly accessible and CORS-compliant URLs. On Web and Desktop versions of Teams, share links to any OneDrive or SharePoint backed video or audio link are also supported.

Use the [image control](image.md) for pictures.

## Properties

**[Poster](control-reference.md#p)** – URL of an image to display before playing. Supports data URI in version 1.2+

**[Alt text](control-reference.md#a)** – Alternate text describing the audio or video.

**[Initially visible](control-reference.md#i)** – If false, this item will be removed from the visual tree.

**[Spacing](control-reference.md#s)** – Controls the amount of spacing between this control and the preceding control.
