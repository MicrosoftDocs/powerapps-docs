# Button control in cards

A button control that executes Power Fx, opens a URL, shows a screen, or toggles visibility on select. Learn more about [how to use the button control](../make-a-card/ui-elements/use-buttons.md).

Buttons are added under the **actions** section of the tree view at the bottom of the card by default. This button can be placed elsewhere in the card and grouped with other buttons using a [button set control](button-set.md).
