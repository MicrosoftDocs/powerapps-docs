# Work with repeating controls in cards (preview)

Data binding is used to repeat controls for a table variable using the **Repeat for every** advanced property.

For example, if you have a table named `fruits` bound to the array `["apples", "oranges", "pears"]`, you can add a Text label control and set its **Repeat for every** property to `fruits` and its **Text** property to `ThisItem.Value`. When it's opened, the card shows three text labels with each of the strings in the table.

The same data binding pattern for tables can be used with other controls and in column sets and containers.
