# Add controls to a card

Controls are the building blocks of your card's interface and functionality. They add text, images, and other elements to create a rich cards experience. Insert, modify, and remove them in the [card designer](../designer-overview.md).

There are three categories of controls that you can add to your card:

- **Display**: Controls that display information, including text, images, and other media
- **Input**: Controls that ask for information from users, such as text, numbers, and dates, or that allow the user to interact with the card, such as buttons and lists
- **Layout**: Controls that modify the layout and appearance of controls

## Prerequisites

- A [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) account
- [A card](../../tutorials/hello-world-card.md)

## Insert a control

1. To get started, sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and then select **Cards**. [!INCLUDE [left-navigation-pane](../../../includes/left-navigation-pane.md)]

1. In the left pane of the card designer, select **Insert**.

1. In the tool pane, select a category to expand it, and then select a control from the list to place it on the card. You can also drag a control from the list and drop it on the card.
