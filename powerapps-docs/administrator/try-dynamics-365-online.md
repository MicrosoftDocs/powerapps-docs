## Partners and Customizers

For more information on which scenario is right for you, see [Installation options](#installation-options) below. 

## New Dynamics 365 (online) customers

## Current Dynamics 365 (online) customers  
 If you already have a [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] subscription, there are a couple ways to see the latest version in action.  
  
### Start a trial  
 You can start a 30-day trial of [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] and try out one or all of the customer engagement applications. This trial uses the [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365](../../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] Customer Engagement Plan license.  
  
<!-- ![Trial experience for Dynamics 365](../media/trial-experience-dynamics-365.png "Trial experience for Dynamics 365")  -->

If you've already done a trial of [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online-legacy](../../includes/pn-crm-online-legacy.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn-crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you cannot do another trial.
