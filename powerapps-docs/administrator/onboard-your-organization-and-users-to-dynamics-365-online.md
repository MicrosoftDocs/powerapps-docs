If a feature is available only for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], it’s indicated in the topic. For more information about which features are online only, see [Online-only features in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/online-only-features)  
  
## Step One: Try out Dynamics 365 (online) in a free 30-day trial

For example, you might want to start with the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Sales app or the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] for Customer Service app, and then add more apps as your needs change. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/home)  
  
 There are four ways to buy a subscription of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]:

<a name="BuyDirect"></a>   
### Buy direct  
 To buy direct, go to the [Dynamics 365 pricing page](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/pricing). This page includes several different plans to fit your organization’s needs.  
  
<a name="VL"></a>   
### Buy through volume licensing  
 If your organization has 250 or more [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] users, you may be interested in [purchasing a Dynamics 365 enterprise licensing agreement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default.aspx).  
  
<a name="Partner"></a>   
### Buy through a cloud solution provider  
 A cloud solution provider can work closely with you to understand the needs of your business or organization. [Learn how to find a Dynamics 365 partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/partner/home).  
  
<a name="support"></a>   
### Choose your support  
 Microsoft provides flexible, industry-leading support, services, and resources that enable users to quickly address technical issues and maximize return on your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] investment. Choose a plan that best meets your business requirements. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Dynamics 365 support](https://www.microsoft.com/dynamics365/support)  
  
<a name="Communicate"></a>   
### Set up points of contacts for communications  
 Microsoft regularly maintains and updates [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] to ensure security, performance, and availability, and to provide new features and functionality. From time to time, Microsoft also responds to service incidents. For each of these activities, the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin for your organization receives email notifications. You have control over who should receive these email communications.

<a name="Subscription"></a>   
### Manage subscriptions, licenses, and user accounts  
 As a [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)] administrator, you manage the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] subscription, including billing and payments, user licenses, accounts and registration. You do these tasks in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] admin center. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage subscriptions, licenses, and user accounts](manage-subscriptions-licenses-user-accounts.md)  
  
<a name="POR"></a>   

### Add a Partner of Record to share account details with your partner  
 Many customers choose to work with a designated Microsoft partner to set up, customize, deploy, and administer their [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] instance(s). If you have a partner assisting you, this process can be facilitated by selecting a designated Partner of Record (POR) inside the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] Portal. This enables the sharing of select details, such as contact and user information with your POR. Sharing this information will allow your partner to more quickly access information about your account, create support requests on your behalf, and work with Microsoft to assist with your accounts.

## Step Three: Plan your deployment and learn about FastTrack  
 Microsoft FastTrack for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] is our customer success service designed to help you move to [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] smoothly and confidently, so you can realize business value faster.

<a name="Plan"></a>   
### Plan your deployment  
 Many decisions you make at the beginning and throughout the deployment process can have downstream effects and impact other phases of the plan. Developing a plan to deploy [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] is important in determining the actions to take from inception to go live. The amount of resources involved in planning depends on the size and scope of the project. Large organizations may need a deployment team, while a small organization may assign these functions to a key person.  
  
 Often times an organization will employ an independent software vendor (ISV), value-added reseller, or partner to help implement and maintain a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] deployment. Partners bring experience, best practices, and industry expertise that will be valuable in the planning and deployment process.

## Step Four: Onboard your organization  
 After you purchase a subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], it’s time to onboard your organization.

<a name="Users"></a>   

### Add users and assign security roles  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] uses role-based security. The security role assigned to a user determines the tasks the user is permitted to perform and the data the user is permitted to view. Every user must be assigned at least one security role to access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)].

<a name="Storage"></a>   

### Manage storage  
 You can manage your organization’s data storage capacity in connection with your subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. The type of subscription you purchase determines the amount of storage initially allocated to your organization. If you run out of storage, you can add more.

<a name="Sandbox"></a>   
### Create a sandbox (non-production instance)  
 You can create a sandbox instance (non-production environment) for development, testing, training, and other non-production uses. Then when you’re ready to turn the sandbox instance into your production instance, you can switch it.  
  
 You get one free sandbox instance with your purchase of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. You can also purchase additional sandbox instances.

### Import and export data  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] provides an import tool for importing simple data stored in files. If the import tool doesn't satisfy your data import requirements, you may want to contact a partner. [Find a partner if you don’t have one.](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/pcv/search)
