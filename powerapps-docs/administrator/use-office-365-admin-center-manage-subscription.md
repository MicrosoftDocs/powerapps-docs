## Manage users  
 Each user signs in to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] with an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID (more precisely, an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID, see the following Note). Access to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] is controlled through the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID.  
  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] to add, edit, and delete [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] users and to reset passwords.  
  
 ![Office 365 admin center active users](media/o365-admin-center-manage-users.png "Office 365 admin center active users")  
  
> [!NOTE] 
> [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] uses [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) as its identity provider. You access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] through an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID that is created and managed in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. For simplicity, we’ll refer to the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID as the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID in this documentation.  
  
 If your company uses on-premises [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] for user identity, you have options that can simplify user management such as providing a single sign-on experience for your users.

<a name="BKMK_SetPassword"></a>   
## Set the password expiration

 ![Office 365 admin center manage password expiration](media/o365-admin-center-password-expiration.png "Office 365 admin center manage password expiration")  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Note the information on this page about users doing their own password reset. To enable your users to be able to reset their passwords themselves, you’ll need to purchase an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] subscription and configure it for password self-service. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Self-service password reset in Azure AD: how to enable, configure, and test self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-passwords-getting-started#enable-users-to-reset-their-azure-ad-passwords)  
  
<a name="BKMK_PasswordSelfSet"></a>   
## Configure self-service password reset and other settings in Azure  
 If you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Basic or Premium subscription, you can set it up so users can do their own password reset. You can access [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] configuration from the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)].

 On the left-side menu of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], choose **Admin centers** > **Azure AD**. Select your subscription in [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] and then choose **Configure**.

<a name="BKMK_AddDomain"></a>   
## Add your domain  
 Use the Manage domains page to add your domain to your subscription. When you add your own domain, user sign-ins can match your company’s URL. For example, instead of user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, it could be user@contoso.com.
