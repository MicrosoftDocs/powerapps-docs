## How do I find the correct Dynamics 365 (online) billing and subscription support team?  
 Before contacting [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] services billing support, you’ll need to determine which platform your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] account is hosted on because each platform has its own billing and subscription management support team. The simplest way to do this is to match your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] account sign-in to one of the formats listed here:  
  
### Microsoft online services platform  
 If you sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] account with a user name that follows this format, `email@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, you’re on the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)]. To find a contact in billing and subscription support, you can:  
  
-   Find your local [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] [billing support number](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=278814).  
  
### Microsoft commerce transaction platform  
 If you sign in to your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] account with a user name that follows this format, `email@live.com`, you’re on the [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] commerce transaction platform.
