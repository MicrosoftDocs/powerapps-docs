# Licensing overview

## About PowerApps licenses

- PowerApps is licensed on a per-user basis. 
- User licenses are assigned on a named user basis, each user needs a separate license to run apps. 
- PowerApps licenses do not limit the creation of apps.
- PowerApps is available with two standalone plans—PowerApps Plan 1 and PowerApps Plan 2. 
- PowerApps Plan 1 provides access to the Common Data Service for Apps to store and mange data. Users can run canvas apps that are built on the Common Data Service for Apps, use premium connectors, access data in custom applications or on-premises data. 
- PowerApps Plan 2 allows users to run model-driven apps with code plug-ins and real-time workflows. For details please visit the [PowerApps pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/).  
- In addition to the standalone plans PowerApps capabilities are also included in certain Office 365 and Dynamics 365 plans allowing customers to extend and customize Office 365 and Dynamics 365 with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow capabilities that these offerings include. Select Dynamics 365 apps and plans include a full PowerApps P2 license, learn more [here](#powerapps-for-dynamics-365).

The differences in functionality between these groups of licenses are described in more detail below.

## PowerApps licensing examples
Let’s take a look at an example. ABC Inc. has 1,000 employees, of which 700 employees are licensed with Office 365 Enterprise 3. Early on, a power user creates a line-of-business application that simplifies how customer orders are tracked. Later, the HR department works with IT to roll out an app for reporting time off and absences, and the app is built on the Common Data Service.

### Order-tracking app
ABC Inc. starts by developing an app for its Office 365 licensed users. The app brings together customer and product configuration data stored in Office 365 SharePoint lists with customer-order documents, which they store in Box.com. Because this app only accesses data stored in Office 365 and a common cloud service covered with a standard connector, the Office 365 licenses they already have cover both creation and usage of this app.

**Licenses required**:  The 700 Office 365 Enterprise 3 licenses they already have are sufficient.

### Time and absence app
Based on how quickly and easily the order-tracking app was launched, ABC’s Human Resources group enlists the help of IT to create a time and absence reporting app that will be rolled out across the entire company. All employees will be required to use this app to report their hours, vacations, and sick days.

For this app, IT selects the Common Data Service as the system in which to store time and absence data. The Common Data Service provides the security and data-policy capabilities that IT requires for information related to employees. They assign two IT employees to the project to create the database and model the time and absence app data in the Common Data Service. These employees are also responsible for tracking app usage and establishing the policy applied to this data.

**Licenses required**:

- **PowerApps Plan 2 – 10 licenses**: The 10 IT administrators who will set up the environments for the company to test and deploy their application, and establish data-security policies will each require PowerApps Plan 2 to perform these functions.
- **PowerApps Plan 1 – 990 licenses**: The 700 Office 365 users will need to be licensed with PowerApps Plan 1 because this app relies on data stored outside Office 365 (that is, in the Common Data Service). The other 290 users who don’t have Office 365 or the PowerApps Plan 2 license will need this license to run the app.
