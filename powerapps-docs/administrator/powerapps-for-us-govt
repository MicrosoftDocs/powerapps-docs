# PowerApps for US Government customers
The **PowerApps service** has a version available for United States Government customers as part of the **Office 365 US Government Community** subscriptions. The **Power BI service** version discussed in this article is specifically designed for US Government customers, and is separate and different from the commercial version of the **Power BI service**.

The following sections describe the *features* available to the US Government version of the **Power BI service**, clarifies some of the *limitations*, lists Frequently Asked Questions (**FAQ**) and answers (including how to sign up), and provides links for more information.

## Features of Power BI US Government
It's important to note that **Power BI US Government** is only available as a **Pro license**, and is not available as a Free license. Certain features of the Power BI service are available in the **Power BI US Government** version of the service.

The following features are available to **Power BI US Government** customers, as they apply to **Pro** license functionality:

* Create and view dashboards and reports
* [Data capacity limits](service-admin-manage-your-data-storage-in-power-bi.md)
* [Scheduled data refresh](refresh-data.md)
* Refreshable team dashboards
* Active Directory groups for sharing and managing access control
* [Import data](service-get-data.md) and reports from Excel, CSV, and Power BI Desktop files
* Data Management Gateway
* All data is encrypted in both Azure SQL and Blob Storage for Power BI
* Connect to services with [content packs](service-connect-to-services.md)

## Connectivity between Government and Public Azure Cloud services 

Azure is distributed among multiple clouds. Be default, tenants are allowed to open firewall rules to a  cloud-specific instance, but cross-cloud networking is different and requires opening specific firewall rules to communicate between services. If you are a Power BI customer and you have existing SQL instances in the public cloud which you need to access, you must open specific firewall rules in SQL to the Azure Government Cloud IP space, for the following datacenters:

* USGov Iowa
* USGov Virginia
* USGov Texas
* USGov Arizona

In the public cloud the IP spaces are available, but for the government cloud, you must open an Azure Support ticket to request the IP ranges for the above listed datacenters. 


## Limitations of Power BI US Government
Some of the features that are available in the commercial version of the **Power BI service** are *not* available in the **Power BI service** for US Government customers. The Power BI team is actively working on making these features available to US Government customers, and will update this article when these features become available.

* **Embed in SharePoint Online** - it is not possible to embed content in SharePoint Online using the Power BI web part.
* **Power BI US Government** is only available as a **Pro** license. Any references to Power BI (Free) licenses in an admin portal (or as users) are running in a commercial Power BI service cloud.
* **Auditing** - auditing is now available through the Office 365 Security and Compliance portal, as of June 2018.
* **Power BI content in Cortana** - Power BI results will not show up in Cortana search results, which includes results for your Power BI content (dashboards, reports, apps) as well as results that show Cortana-optimized report pages for specific keywords.
* **External user sharing** - sharing is allowed within a Power BI tenant, and as of June 2018, sharing is also allowed with users outside of your Power BI tenant. See [distribute Power BI content to external guest users with Azure AD B2B](service-admin-azure-ad-b2b.md).
* **Usage metrics for dashboards and reports** - usage metrics are not available for reports and dashboards. Customers can use audit log data to get usage information for content in their organization.

If you have **Power BI** Free licenses assigned to your account, those accounts are running in a commercial version of the **Power BI** service, and are not part of the **Power BI US Government** offering. For those Free accounts, you may encounter the following issues:

* Gateway, Mobile, and Desktop can’t authenticate
* You cannot access Azure commercial data sources
* PBIX files must be manually uploaded from commercial
* Power BI mobile apps are not available

To resolve issues, please contact your account representative.
