When you purchase a subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], you receive a set of licenses to assign to users. Only licensed users are allowed access to the online service. You must assign a license to every user who will use the service.  
  
 A license conflict occurs if your organization has more users than licenses.

## Running out of Dynamics 365 (online) licenses?  
 If you are running out of licenses, you have several options:  
  
-   Add licenses to your subscription and then assign licenses to users.  
  
     For step-by-step instructions for adding licenses to a subscription that is managed through [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)], see [Manage licenses](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255512).  
  
-   Remove licenses from other users. This disables the user account in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and frees up the license so that you can re-assign it.  
  
     For step-by-step instructions for removing a license that you manage through [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)], see [Manage licenses](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255512).  
  
-   Remove a user account by deleting it. This disables the user account in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] and frees up the license so that you can re-assign it.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >  Delete the user accounts of people who leave your company. This frees up the licenses so that you can re-assign them.  
  
     For step-by-step instructions about deleting a user account that you manage through [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)], see [Delete or restore users](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255518).  
  
-   If a license conflict occurs because your credit card information has become outdated in [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services](../../includes/pn-ms-online-services.md)], you can renew your subscription by updating the credit card information, for example, by updating the card’s expiration date, or by adding a new credit card.  
  
     For step-by-step instructions for updating credit card information, see [Update your credit card information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255525).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Signing out of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] doesn't sign you out of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. You must do that separately.  
  
 To cancel your subscription to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] for any reason, call Billing Support at the phone number listed for your country or region here: [Billing Support and Phone Numbers](contact-information-microsoft-dynamics-365-online-https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/billing-support).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you don’t have access to a phone, you may submit your cancellation request as a service request. To enter the service request, sign in to your account, and then, under **Support**, click or tap **Service Requests**. In the **Problem Description** area, fill out the form for a new service request by choosing **Cancel subscription**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Save your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] data to a location where you can retrieve it later, if needed.
