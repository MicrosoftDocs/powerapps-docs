# View analytics reports for your app
Have you built an app and shared it out to your organization?  Are you curious how many of your colleagues are using it on a daily basis?

Introducing the first  PowerApps analytics report that is now available from [web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com); the **App usage report**.

The App usage report gives you the ability to track how many users are using your app over the past 30 days broken down by day, device platform and location.

## How do I get access to my app's reports?
All reports are available to any user with "Can edit" permission to the app, but the user must have a PowerApps Plan 2 or PowerApps Plan 2 trial license in order to access the reports.

## Where do I find my app's reports?
You can view your app's reports via the following steps:

1. Go to [web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com).
2. Select **Apps** from the left navigation bar

2. Select **Export data**

## Are there going to be any other reports?
Yes! In fact we are planning to develop similar reports around app performance and error reporting.

If you have specific feedback, questions, or requests we would love to hear about them on our [PowerApps Ideas forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/PowerApps-Ideas/idb-p/PowerAppsIdeas).
