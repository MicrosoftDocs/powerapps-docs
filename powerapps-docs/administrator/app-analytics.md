# View analytics reports for your app
Have you built an app and shared it out to your organization?  Are you curious how many of your colleagues are using it on a daily basis?

Introducing the first  Power Apps analytics report that is now available from [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc); the **App usage report**.

The App usage report gives you the ability to track how many users are using your app over the past 30 days broken down by day, device platform and location.

## How do I get access to my app's reports?
All reports are available to any user with "Can edit" permission to the app, but the user must have a Power Apps Plan 2 or Power Apps Plan 2 trial license in order to access the reports.

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).

## Are there going to be any other reports?
Yes! In fact we are planning to develop similar reports around app performance and error reporting.
