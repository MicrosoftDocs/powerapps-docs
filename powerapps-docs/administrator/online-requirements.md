# Microsoft Dynamics 365 (online) requirements 

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] gives you the following options to access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data:  
  
-   Web browser. No need to install anything to run [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] from a computer running a supported web browser.  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)]. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] add-in that provides you with a complete set of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] capabilities right within [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-outlook-full.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../../includes/pn-moca-short.md)]. Lightweight applications that let you access Dynamics 365 data on almost any web browser running on a tablet, smartphone, or non-Windows computer.  
  
## Web browser requirements  
 You use a common web browser, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Mozilla_Firefox](../../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Google_Chrome](../../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_Apple_Safari](../../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)] to view, add, or edit information stored in your organization’s [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] database. For more information about the supported web browsers and hardware requirements, see [Web application requirements for Microsoft Dynamics 365](web-application-requirements.md).  

## Mobile device requirements  
 Users can work in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] by using a supported browser on a mobile device, or by using [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)]. For more information about the mobile experience in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], see [Set up Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/set-up-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-dynamics-365-for-tablets).  

## Microsoft Office requirements  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)] leverages the capabilities of on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] and integrates with [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)]. For more information about the supported versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../../includes/pn-ms-office.md)], see [Supported versions of Office](web-application-requirements.md#supported-versions-of-office).
