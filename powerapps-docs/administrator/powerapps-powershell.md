# PowerShell support for PowerApps (preview)
With the preview launch of the PowerShell cmdlets for app creators and administrators, you can automate many of the monitoring and management tasks that are only possible manually today in [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com) or the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com).

## Installation
To run the PowerShell cmdlets for app makers, do the following:

1. Download the [PowerShell scripts file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872358).

2. Unzip the file into a folder.

3. Open a PowerShell command window (as administrator) in that same folder.

4. Run the following one-time PowerShell command (this presumes you've never run PowerShell commands on the current machine):

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
    ```

5. Import the necessary modules using the following commands:

    ```
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    ```
6.  There is a [known issue](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Administering-PowerApps/Getting-errors-when-I-try-to-import-the-preview-powerapps/td-p/109036) today that may also require you to manually unblock the PowerShell files using the following command:

    ```
    dir . | Unblock-File
    ```
    
7. Before accessing any of the commands, provide your credentials using the following command. These credentials are refreshed for up to ~8 hours before you're required to sign in again to continue using the cmdlets.

    ```
    Add-PowerAppsAccount
    ```
