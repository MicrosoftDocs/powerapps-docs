# Quickly navigate with the Office 365 app launcher and the Dynamics 365 home page

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

[!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] introduces a new app model for [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] apps and makes accessing these and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps fast and easy.  
  
 If you're a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] user with an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription, you're just two clicks away from accessing the family of online apps that are available to you, like [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] and Excel Online.  
  
 [Watch a short video (3:35) about the Dynamics 365 business apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=837700).  
  
<a name="BKMK_AppLauncher"></a>   
## For admins and end users: Quickly move between apps with the new Office 365 app launcher  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] app launcher is built in to all Dynamics and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps. Use the app launcher to quickly navigate to your Dynamics application of choice.  
  
 If you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription, click  the app launcher to go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps and services available to you.  
  
 ![Office 365 app launcher](media/new-office-365-app-launcher.png "Office 365 app launcher")  
  
 Check your email.  Create  a [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_Word_short](../includes/pn-ms-word-short.md)] doc. Get files from your [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive](../includes/pn-onedrive.md)].  All while staying just two clicks away from getting back to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
> **TIP**: If you've just started a trial or upgraded to [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)], you might need to refresh or open a new browser session to see your apps. There might be a delay for your instance to fully provision.  
>   
>  For [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online_Government_Full](../includes/pn-crm-online-government-full.md)] subscriptions, the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] app launcher will take users to either [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)]. Admins will go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)].  
  
<a name="BKMK_SelectAdminFromAppLaunch"></a>   
## For admins: Get to the admin center through the Office 365 app launcher  
 If you're a [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] system administrator or an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] global administrator, click the app launcher to see the **Admin** tile.  
  
 ![Admin tile on the the Office 365 app launcher](media/select-admin-from-app-launcher.png "Admin tile on the the Office 365 app launcher")  
  
 Click the **Admin** tile to go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], where you can add users and change passwords.

## For admins and end users: Introducing the Dynamics 365 home page  
 If you've transitioned to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_8_2_0_online](../includes/pn-crm-8-2-0-online.md)], we have a new page for you to manage and open [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] apps. Click **[!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)]**from the app launcher, to go to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] home page ([home.dynamics.com](http://home.dynamics.com)).

Clicking [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] takes [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online_Government_Full](../includes/pn-crm-online-government-full.md)] users to your instance of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] or to the [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)].  
  
 See the next section to see what you can do with the home page.  
  
<a name="BKMK_ViewApps"></a>   
### View your apps  
 Any [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] app for which you have a license appears as an app module tile on this page. If you have multiple instances of an app, select the tile for the instance you want to open.  
  
 In this example, there are two instances of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] displayed.
