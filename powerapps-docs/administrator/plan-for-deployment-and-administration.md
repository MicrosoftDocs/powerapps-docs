# Plan for deployment and administration

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Your [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] deployment will go more smoothly with some preliminary planning.  The following table lists some of the items to consider before you start the actual deployment process.  
  
|Item|Description|Considerations|  
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|  
|Environment discovery|A detailed description of your organization’s environment in terms of number of users, groups or teams, and the number and type of business units or divisions. Identify current [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data that you would like to bring into [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], and your overall data storage requirements. Include a business requirements analysis that describes your organization’s expectation or requirements for a service level agreement (SLA). An SLA is an agreement between two or more parties describing the deliverables, support, and communication that each party will provide to the other. Specify your policies related to security and privacy.|Is there enough overlap in customers and products across business units to be able to work in the same [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] data? What type of security policy does the organization already have in place? Are there any special requirements in this area? Is there a plan for business growth that could affect the number of users of [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]?<br /><br /> Plan for enough time to do this discovery; information that comes out of this exercise can affect the way you implement the service.|  
|Single sign-on|An authentication process that enables a user to access multiple systems or services through a single set of sign-on credentials. For example, implementing single sign-on for [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] in an organization’s network environment means that after a user signs in to the network, that user does not have to enter credentials again when accessing [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. **Note:**  For [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscribers, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance must be in the same tenant as your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription. A user account in [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] can only sync with one tenant.|There are additional requirements to implement single sign-on, therefore, consider how important it is to your organization.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage user account synchronization](manage-user-account-synchronization.md)|  
|Integration with [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] applications|You can significantly enhance your company’s online, collaborative experience by integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] applications with your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] subscription. This requires a separate purchase of an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription<br /><br /> You’ll have the best integration experience if your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] subscription and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance are in the same tenant.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[cc_Office365PlanRequirement](../includes/cc-office365planrequirement.md)]|[!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [What is Office 365 and how does it relate to Dynamics 365 (online)?](what-office-365-how-does-relate.md)|  
|Administrative roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)]|A number of administrative roles are available to assign to users if you manage your subscription in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)]. Administrative roles define administrative responsibilities related to subscription management activities, for example, billing administration, password administration, and user management administration.|Consider the available administrative roles and the needs of your environment to identify the roles you want to use and the users you will choose for each role. The global administrator role is the highest level role, having all the permissions to manage any part of the subscription process. We recommend that you assign this role to more than one person so that someone is always available to manage all aspects of the subscription. **Note:**  Administrative roles cover all subscription management functions within the service. These aren’t the same as the security roles that you assign to users in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], which are required and govern access to resources in the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] service. See “Security roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]” in this table.|  
|Security roles in [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)]|[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] uses role-based security.  The security role assigned to a user determines the tasks the user is permitted to perform and the data that the user is permitted to view.|Every user must be assigned at least one security role  to access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)]. **Note:**  Security roles aren’t the same as administrative roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)], which cover subscription management and related activities in the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Online_Services_Portal](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-portal.md)]. See: Administrative roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)] in this table.|  
|Importing data|[!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] offers a wizard to help with importing Dynamics 365 data from other applications and services.|If you import data from other systems, consider the way you’ll process the data to minimize errors. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Import data (all record types)](import-data-all-record-types.md)|  
|Product updates|Some [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] releases will include optional product updates that you can choose to enable.|Product updates may affect existing customizations in your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance. Review the documentation associated with each product update before you enable it in a production environment. Additionally, some product updates, such as the sales and service process forms, can’t be removed or easily reverted to the previous functionality. Therefore, you should give careful consideration before you enable a product update. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Manage product updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-updates) **Tip:**  If you’re unsure whether you want to enable a product update in a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance used in production, sign up for a trial subscription to evaluate the new functionality.
