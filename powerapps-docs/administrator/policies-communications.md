# Policies and Communications for service incidents

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]<br/>[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-8-2-0](../../includes/cc_applies_to_update_8_2_0.md)]

Microsoft regularly maintains and updates [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] to ensure security, performance, and availability, and to provide new features and functionality. From time to time, Microsoft also responds to service incidents. For each of these activities, the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin for your organization,  or recipients added to the notification list by the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin, receives email notifications. During a service incident, a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] customer service representative may also call and follow up with an email.  
  
 If you’re not sure who your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin is, see [Find your Dynamics 365 administrator or support person](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/find-administrator-support).  
  
 If you want to change who receives email communications, see [Manage email notifications](manage-email-notifications.md).  
  
 If you’re a [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin, you can also see the latest status of updates and incidents in the [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] service health page. To learn how to get to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page, see [View the status of your services](https://support.office.com/article/View-the-status-of-your-services-932ad3ad-533c-418a-b938-6e44e8bc33b0).  
  
 To learn more about each type of maintenance and update activity, as well as the communications your organization receives, click on one of the following, or scroll down:  
  
<a name="bkmk_PlannedMaintenance"></a>   

## Planned maintenance  
 Planned maintenance includes updates and changes to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] service to provide increased stability, reliability, and performance. These changes can include:  
  
-   Hardware or infrastructure updates  
  
-   Integrated services, such as a new version of [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)]  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] service changes and software updates  
  
-   Minor service updates to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] that occur about 10 times per year. See [Service updates](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2925359/microsoft-dynamics-crm-online-releases).  
  
**How do I find out about planned maintenance?**  
  
 Your organization will receive a Maintenance notification through the [Office 365 Message Center](https://support.office.com/article/Message-center-in-Office-365-38fb3333-bfcc-4340-a37b-deda509c2093). Additionally, for maintenance activities that impact your ability to use the service, [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] System Administrators will receive an email notification.  
  
 You can also view notifications in the [Office 365 Admin mobile app](https://products.office.com/business/manage-office-365-admin-app) on your mobile device.  
  
 In addition, you can  see the schedule and status of planned maintenance activities on the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page. To learn how to get to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page, see [View the status of your services](https://support.office.com/article/View-the-status-of-your-services-932ad3ad-533c-418a-b938-6e44e8bc33b0).  
  
<a name="bkmk_UnplannedMaintenance"></a>   

## Unplanned maintenance  
 From time to time, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] inevitably encounters unplanned issues that require changes to ensure availability. Microsoft strives to provide as much notification as possible during these events. Because these events can’t be predicted, they are not considered planned maintenance.  
  
 **How do I find out about unplanned maintenance?**  
  
 Your organization receives an “Unplanned Maintenance” email. These emails go out to all [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] System Administrators in every [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] instance that is affected by the unplanned maintenance.  
  
 You can also see the status of current unplanned maintenance activities on the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page. To learn how to get to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page, see [View the status of your services](https://support.office.com/article/View-the-status-of-your-services-932ad3ad-533c-418a-b938-6e44e8bc33b0).  
  
 Planned and unplanned maintenance emails can be identified by the light-orange banner.  
  
 ![Planned and unplanned maintenance banner](../media/maintenance-banner.png "Planned and unplanned maintenance banner")  
  
<a name="bkmk_SecurityUpdates"></a>   

## Security updates  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] team regularly performs the following to ensure the security of the system:  
  
-   Scans of the service to identify possible security vulnerabilities  
  
-   Assessments of the service to ensure that key security controls are operating effectively  
  
-   Evaluations of the service to determine exposure to any vulnerabilities identified by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), which regularly monitors external vulnerability awareness sites  
  
The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] team identifies and tracks any identified issues, and takes swift action to mitigate risks when necessary.  
  
**How do I find out about security updates?**  
  
 Because the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] team strives to apply risk mitigations in a way that doesn’t require service downtime, [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrators usually don’t receive emails for security updates. If a security update does require service downtime, it is considered planned maintenance.  
  
 For more information about [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] security, see [Dynamics 365 (online) Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/CloudServices/Dynamics365).  
  
<a name="bkmk_ServiceUpdates"></a>   

## Major service updates  
 Dynamics 365 (online) typically releases two major service updates per year. Major service updates provide new features and functionality to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  

> [!NOTE]
> For information about minor service updates, see [Service updates](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2925359/microsoft-dynamics-crm-online-releases).
  
 Improvements in the update process put the power in your hands for scheduling your organization’s service updates. You can choose from a list of available dates. Service updates are only applied after they are approved by the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] admin - please review the important note below outlining the Dynamics 365 online update policy. This helps you to plan well in advance for your upgrade path, while using your sandbox organization to properly test and evaluate the service updates with your existing production code.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Be sure to check out [Update policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-updates#BKMK_Policy) for important information about updating to the latest version.  
  
 **How do I find out about major service updates?**  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] team preschedules customers for the service update and emails [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] admins 90 days before the scheduled update. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] admins receive additional emails at 90 days, 30 days, 15 days, 7 days, 0 or day of, and post update.  
  
 In the email, you have the opportunity to either approve the scheduled date or reschedule the update from a list of dates. All customers are updated during the defined service update release period, usually over a three-month window.  
  
 To find out more about rescheduling service updates, see [Manage Dynamics 365 (online) updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/manage-updates).  
  
 To find out what’s new and how to prepare for the next release, check out the following resources:  
  
-   [Important changes coming in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/whats-new/customer-engagement/important-changes-coming)  
  
Emails regarding the scheduling or rescheduling of your update will be sent with a light-blue banner.  
  
 ![Banner in email for scheduling your update](../media/scheduling-banner.png "Banner in email for scheduling your update")  
  
<a name="bkmk_ServiceIncidents"></a>   

## Service incidents  
 A service incident occurs when your organization is inaccessible or you’re unable to use the service or one of its components. Examples include:  
  
-   Getting a “page not found” or 404 error when you try to access [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)].  
  
-   All of your users are unable to sign in to your organization.  
  
-   Your users can sign in, but can’t save their changes.  
  
-   Users can sign in, but see a blank screen.  
  
**How do I find out about service incidents?**  
  
 If you open a case to report a service incident, a [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] customer support representative will call your [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admin and follow up with an email when the service incident is resolved.  
  
<a name="bkmk_MajorServiceIncidents"></a>   
## Major service incidents  
 A major service incident occurs when multiple organizations can’t access the service.  
  
 **How do I find out about major service incidents?**  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] policy is to send email updates to the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] admins of affected customers as soon as we are aware of a major service incident, and a final email once the issue is considered resolved.  
  
 You can also see the status of major service incidents in your [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page. To learn how to get to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page, see [View the status of your services](https://support.office.com/article/View-the-status-of-your-services-932ad3ad-533c-418a-b938-6e44e8bc33b0).  
  
 In addition, five business days after the incident resolution, the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] team publishes a post-incident report (PIR) to the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../../includes/pn-office-365.md)] service health page. This report summarizes the following details about the incident:  
  
-   Description  
  
-   Root cause  
  
-   Customer impact  
  
-   Start date and time  
  
-   Resolution date and time  
  
-   Next steps  
  
If the service incident breaches your [Service Level Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=196557), you can claim a billing credit according to the conditions of your [Service Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=101174). If you need help with this, see [Billing FAQs for Dynamics 365 (online)](billing-faqs-dynamics-365-online.md).
  
Major service incident emails can easily be identified by the orange banner.  
  
 ![Service incident email banner](../media/service-incident-banner.png "Service incident email banner")  
  
<a name="BKMK_ServiceRestored"></a>   
## Service restored  
 [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] will send you an email when normal system services have been restored. You can easily identify these emails by the light-green banner.  
  
 ![Service restored email banner](../media/service-restored-banner.png "Service restored email banner")  
  
<a name="BKMK_GeneralAwareness"></a>   

## General awareness  
 These emails are specific to managing the [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Service, including changes with the service or feature offerings. They can be informational in nature, drive specific actions, or both. The target audience for these communications are [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] System Administrators or individuals designated to running the service. You can easily identify these by the light-blue banner.  
  
 ![General awareness email banner](../media/general-awareness-banner.png "General awareness email banner")  
  
<a name="BKMK_LaunchReadiness"></a>   

## Launch and post launch readiness communications  
 These communications are used to inform [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrators about important information prior to a major service release. Our goal is to share information about tasks that administrators may need to perform before the release and to inform customers about new or enhanced capabilities that are coming in the release. You’ll see a green banner when receiving these types of communications.  
  
 ![Launch readiness email banner](../media/readiness-banner.png "Launch readiness email banner")  
  
<a name="BKMK_PostPurchase"></a>   

## Post-purchase customer lifecycle communications  
 Once a customer has purchased [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], we send a series of helpful email communications to [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_shortest](../../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] administrators during the first year. These communications direct customers to a number of resources that will assist both administrators and users to successfully adopt and expand their use of [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  
  
 You can easily identify these communications by the dark-blue banner.  
  
 ![Post-purchase email banner](../media/post-purchase-banner.png "Post-purchase email banner")
