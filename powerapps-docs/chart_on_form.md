# View charts on a form page

Use interactive dashboards to see workload information and take action. The charts on a interactive dashboard serves as a simple filtering source. You can select different data points on a chart to filter data based on the filter criteria. 
Interactive dashboards are system dashboards that only an admin can create. To learn more on how to create and configure interactive dashboards, see [Create and configure model-driven app interactive experience dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/configure-interactive-experience-dashboards).

Interactive dashboards come in two forms: multi-stream and single-stream. In addition, multi-stream dashboards can be home page or entity-specific dashboards. The multi-stream dashboards display data in real time over multiple data streams.
