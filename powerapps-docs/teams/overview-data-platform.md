## Tables in Project Oakdale

Project Oakdale tables provide the ability to create, populate, and query data within Project Oakdale. Tables represent different types of entities important to an organization, such as a table to store products or another to store orders.  

Each of these tables includes columns that contain data about the subject of the table. For example, a table named *Product* might have columns that contain a product name, product identifier, manufacturer identifier, and price. Each of these columns can contain different types of data. For example, the type of data for a product name is text, identifiers could be numbers, and so on.

A solution often has multiple tables that are used together in an application. For example, an Order table might reference multiple other tables, such as Customer, Product, and Country. These tables are "related" to one another, and tables provide the way to create those relationships.

You can create and populate these tables with a new visual editor that makes it even easier to work with these tables.

> [!NOTE]
> All the capabilities found in tables are powered by Project Oakdale. Although this will satisfy many situations, in some situations an organization might want to have additional capacity, capabilities, or control over their solution. In these scenarios, Project Oakdale environments can be upgraded to Common Data Service. The upgrade process, referred to as *promotion*, has several considerations discussed in [Promotion process](/power-platform/admin/about-teams-environment?branch=teams-preview#promotion-process) in the Microsoft Power Platform admin guide.

## Security in Project Oakdale

These tables and the applications that use them are secured with enterprise-grade security that's easy to understand and use for low-code and no-code developers. Security in Project Oakdale aligns to how security is handled in Teams, with a focus on Owners, Members, and Guests.

## Administer Project Oakdale environment

You can administer and manage Project Oakdale environment using the Power Platform admin center. More information: [About the Project Oakdale environment](/power-platform/admin/about-teams-environment) in the Power Platform admin guide.
