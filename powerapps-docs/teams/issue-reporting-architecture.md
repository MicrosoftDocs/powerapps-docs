# Understand Issue Reporting sample app architecture

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Manage Issues](issue-reporting.md#manage-issues-app) and [Issue Reporting](issue-reporting.md#issue-reporting-app) apps, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Issue Reporting sample app instead, go to [Issue Reporting sample app](issue-reporting.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and browse between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](issue-reporting.md) Issue Reporting sample app.

## Architecture Model

The following diagram illustrates the way that users and systems interact with data in the Issue Reporting solution

![Issue Reporting sample app architecture model.](media/issue-reporting-architecture/architecture-model.png "Issue Reporting sample app architecture model")

### Connectors

The following connectors are used in the Issue Reporting app:

- **Microsoft Dataverse** - used to read and write data in Dataverse.
- **Office 365 Users** - used to read Microsoft 365 user profile data.
- **Location** - Used to capture the user's location for Planner tasks.
- **Microsoft Planner** - Used to create tasks for issues.

## Data model

The following diagram explains the data model used by the Issue Reporting sample app.

### Tables

The section describes the tables contained in the Issue Reporting solution, along with their purpose.

| Table                       | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Issue Report                | Issues refer to a problem  or trouble being faced by the Users. Information such as the Name, Issue  category, issue template, Planner Task ID, due date, assigned user, and  description are stored in the **Issue reports** table.     An issue can be related only to a single Category and Template. |
| Issue  Report Category      | Categories  are used to group similar issues. Details such as the Name, Category  Icon, Planner Bucket ID are stored in the **Issue Report Categories** table. A  Category can have multiple Issues and Issue Templates associated to it. |
| Issue Report Template       | Issue  templates have predefined questions that must be answered by the users while  creating an issue that helps us in understanding it better. Details such as  the Due Date, Category the user to whom the tasks should be assigned, the  primary contact information are stored in the **Issue Report Templates** table.  There can be multiple questions and issues related to an Issue template. |
| Issue  Report Questions     | Questions  are part of the Issue Templates that help in explaining the issue in a  better way. Details such as the Issue template and the sequence are stored in  the **Issue Report Questions** table. There can be multiple questions in an Issue  template. |
| Issue Report Settings       | Settings  are used to store configurations for the app, including the Team and Planner IDs for where to log issues as Planner Tasks. |
| Issue  Report User Settings | User settings are used to store user  preferences pertaining to seeing the Power Apps splash screen every time they  log in to the app. There is one record for each user. |
