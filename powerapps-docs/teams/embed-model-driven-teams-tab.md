# Embed a model-driven app as tab app in Teams

You can customize the Teams experience by adding Power Apps model-driven apps to your channels in Teams using the **Power Apps** tab. After enabling your apps to be embedded inside of Teams, you can embed your model-driven app in Teams.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Model-driven apps can execute code that may not be generated by Microsoft. Make sure that the code for the apps in this environment are from a trusted source.

## Enable integration of model-driven apps in Teams

Before embedding your model-driven app into Teams, you first need to enable integration of model-driven apps in Teams for your environment. To do so, ask your tenant admin to enable the Microsoft Teams Integration for your environment in the Power Platform admin center. More information: [Enable Microsoft Teams Integration for model-driven apps](/power-platform/admin/enable-teams-integration) in the Power Platform admin guide.

## Embed a model-driven app

1. In Microsoft Teams, select a team, and a channel under that team. In this example, it's the **General** channel under the **Business Development** team.

The app is now available to use in the channel.
