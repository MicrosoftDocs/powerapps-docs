# Understand Get connected sample app architecture (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the Get connected ap, and understand how to use them effectively. This article covers the following details:

- Data model and purpose of the various entities used.
- Architecture model of the Get connected solution.
- List of all collections and variables used.
- Detailed breakdown of each functionality.

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

## Data model

The following diagram explains the data model used by the Get connected sample app.

![Get connected sample app data model](media/get-connected-architecture/data-model.png "Get connected sample app data model")

| Table name | Description |
| - | - |
|**Connection Profile**| A table to store Profile. Details such as Name, Introduction, LinkedIn URL,  created on and who the row was it created or modified by are stored in the Connection Profile table.|
|**Connection Profile Skill**|Connection Profile Skill stores skill records that are available to users to select from when users add their skills.   Details such as Name, Email, Skill, skills type to which it's associated to  and the date when the skill was created on, modified on are stored in the Connection profile skill table.|
|**Connection Skill Tag**|Connection Skill Tag shows skill category records such as Name, date when the row was created, and date when the row was modified.|
|**Connection User Setting**|Connection User Setting Stores Name, Email when users open the app user  can make choice to set the toggles to open to random connections, open to  peer match or open to help.  Details such as Name, Email, and the user settings created on, modified on  are stored in the  Connection User Setting table.|

## Architecture model

The following architecture model diagram illustrates the way that users and systems interact with data:
