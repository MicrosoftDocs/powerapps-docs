# Power Apps and Teams integration

Microsoft Teams enables people around the world to create, collaborate, and communicate. With more than 75 million daily active users, Teams is how people are getting work done.

Power Apps can be used in three scenarios with Microsoft Teams:

Scenario|Description
--------|-------
[Embed a canvas app as a tab app](embed-teams-tab.md)| In this scenario, you use the **Power Apps tab** for Teams to embed a canvas app as a tab app.|
[Embed a canvas app as a personal app](embed-teams-app.md)| In this scenario, you embed a canvas app as a first-class Teams personal app.| 
[Create apps in Teams backed by Project Oakdale](create-apps-overview)|In this scenario, you can use the new **Power Apps** app in Teams to create canvas apps *within Teams* backed by **Project Oakdale**, the new built-in, low-code data platform for Microsoft Teams. Project Oakdale empowers users to build custom apps, bots, and workflows using Power Apps, Power Virtual Agents, and Power Automate respectively without ever leaving the Teams interface.
