# Send notification to the Team when work item status is updated in the Milestones sample app

The Milestones sample app for Microsoft Teams allows users to track progress of completion of work items in projects across milestones. While the app allows work items to be updated and maintained, there's currently no standard notifications about work item updates to the team.

In this article, we'll learn how to create a Power Automate flow to send an adaptive card notification to the Team (in which the app is installed) when work item status changes.

Watch this video to learn how to configure notification to the Team when work item status is updated in the Milestones sample app:

## Prerequisites

To complete this exercise, we would need the ability to log in into Teams that will be available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions and will also need to have the Milestones Power Apps template for Teams installed. This app can be installed from <https://aka.ms/TeamsInspection>.

## Log in into the Milestones app

1. Select the Power Apps icon on the left and go to the Build tab.

1. Select the Team in which the Milestones app is installed from the left app  menu.

1. Select **Installed apps** and select on Milestones to open the app. The Milestones app opens.

## Add condition to call the Power Automate flow

1. From the tree view in the left pane, select the **Projects** screen.

1. On the screen, press down the **Alt** key, and select to open any one project. The Add/Edit Work Item screen opens.

1. Select the **Done** button.

1. Select the **OnSelect** property of the done button.

1. On selecting the **Done** button, along with the other updates that run in the  background, we also want to trigger a flow that would send out an adaptive card update to the Team if the status of the work item is updated. To do this change, add the following to the top of the OnSelect formula:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If(
    
        locEditWorkItem,
    
        //adding code to call a flow when status changes
    
            If(
    
                locSelectedWorkItem.'Work Item Status'.'Project Work Item Status' \<\>
                cmbAddWorkItemStatus.Selected.'Project Work Item Status',
    
        true //your flow call will come here
    
    ); 
    ```

1. Copy the entire code from the **OnSelect** property of the **Done** button, and paste it in a text editor for use later.

1. Select **...** (ellipsis) next to **Settings** on the top ribbon, and select **Power Automate**.

1. The **Data** pop-up opens with the option to **Create a new flow**.

1. Select the **Create a new flow** button. A browser window opens with the new Power Automate flow screen.

1. Update the name of the flow to – "Send Adaptive card notification when the status of the work order changes".

1. Select the option to trigger Power Apps from the list of triggers. The new flow gets created and the Power Apps step is loaded on the screen.

## Create the Power Automate flow

1. After following the steps in the previous section, select the **+New** step button.

1. Select the action **Get a row by ID**, and select Table Name as **Project Work Items**.

1. Under Row ID, open the dynamic content and select the **Ask in Power Apps** option.

1. Rename the step to "Get Work Item record".

1. Select the **+Next** step button again, and select the action **Get a row by ID**, and select Table Name as **Work Item Statuses**.

1. Under Row ID open the dynamic content, select **Work Item Status (Value)**.

1. Rename the step to Get Work Item Status record.

1. Add another step by selecting **+New** step.

1. Add the action Initialize variable.

    - Rename step to Initialize variable - Card Title

    - Name - "varCardTitle"

    - Type - "String"

    - Value = Status update for Work Item {*and then select dynamic content Name of the Work item added in step 3*}

1. Add another step by selecting **+New** step.

1. Add the action Initialize variable.

    - Rename step to Initialize variable - Review Link
    - Name - "varReviewWorkItemLink"
    - Type - "String"
    - Value - leave blank - will be added later.

    > [!NOTE]
    > After adding a new step, you may see a warning in the flow checker. This warning is expected because the flow is called from a Power Apps app, and adding a new step to a flow called from a Power Apps app may break the connection with the app. Later in the exercise, we'll replace the connection to the flow to fix this warning.

1. For the **Review Work Item Link** action, we'll use the link to the app. To find this link, open the team where the Milestones app is installed, and copy the link for tab in which the app is installed. You can copy the link to the tab by opening the tab, then selecting **...** (ellipses) in the upper right corner.

    Your URL will look similar to the following example:

    `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/GUID/_djb2_msteams_prefix_956529380?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3Anull%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3AGUID%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&groupId=GUID&tenantId=GUID`

1. To continue, copy the part of the URL that comes after **context=**, and use a URL decoder such as <https://www.urldecoder.org/> to decode the URL.

1. Copy that decoded text and go back to the Power Automate flow.

1. Return to the Initialize variable- Review Work item Link ste.

1. Set the Value field to the decoded URL text copied earlier.

1. Add a new step with the action **Compose**, and in the **Inputs** field, paste the following snippet.

    ```
    replace(replace(replace(variables('varReviewWorkItemLink'),'{','%7B'),'"','%22'),'}','%7D')
    ```

1. Add another step by selecting **+New step**.

1. Select the action Post adaptive card in a chat or channel (Preview).

     - Post as - User
     - Post in - Channel
     - Team - {the team in which your app is installed}
     - Channel - General
     - Adaptive Card - Paste the following JSON code:

        > [!NOTE]
        > The following JSON code contains dynamic references to values from previous flow steps. These should automatically resolve to the correct reference, but if they do not, manually update them with the correct reference. For example, @{outputs('Get_Work_Item_Status_record')?['body/msft_name']} references the name column from the Get Work Item Status step.
    
         ```
         {
                     "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                     "body": [
                     {
                
                            "type": "TextBlock",
                
                "size": "large",
                
                "weight": "Bolder",
                
                "text": "Status Update for
                @{outputs('Get_Work_Item_record')?['body/msft_name']}",
                
                "wrap": true
                
                },
                
                {
                
                "type": "TextBlock",
                
                "text": "Status for Work Item
                '@{outputs('Get_Work_Item_record')?['body/msft_name']}' has been updated to
                @{outputs('Get_Work_Item_Status_record')?['body/msft_name']}",
                
                "wrap": true
                
                }
                
                ],
                
                "actions": [
                
                {
                
                "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
                
                "title": "View @{variables('varCardTitle')}",
                //Update the part of the following URL before "context=" with the URL copied in step 12. 
                "url":
                "[https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/040880f4-0c68-4c38-8821-d5efd2b6ddbe/_djb2_msteams_prefix_956529380?context=@{outputs('Compose](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/040880f4-0c68-4c38-8821-d5efd2b6ddbe/_djb2_msteams_prefix_956529380?context=@%7boutputs('Compose)')}"
                
                }
                
                ],
                
                "$schema": "<http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json>",
                
                "version": "1.2"
                
                }
         ```

1. Save the flow.

## Trigger the flow from the Power Apps

1. After the flow is saved, go back to the Teams, and open the app in Power Apps.

1. In the tree view, select the **Add/Edit Work Item** screen.

1. Select the **Update** button.

1. Update the **OnSelect** property to make sure the flow is triggered.

1. Copy the formula from wherever you had pasted it earlier into the **OnSelect** property.

1. In the first If condition that was added on the top, replace “true” with the run function used to trigger the flow trigger. See example below.

    ```powerapps-dot
    If(
    
    locEditWorkItem,
    
    //adding code to call a flow when status changes
    
    If(
    
    locSelectedWorkItem.'Work Item Status'.'Project Work Item Status' \<\>
    cmbAddWorkItemStatus.Selected.'Project Work Item Status',
    SendAdaptivecardnotificationwhenthestatusoftheworkorderchanges.Run(locSelectedWorkItem.'Project Work item') //your flow call will come here
    
    );
    
    //end code
    ```

## Update the Loading screen

1. From the tree view, select the **Loading Screen**.

1. Expand the loading screen and then **conLoading_HiddenHelper** under it.

1. Select the timer **tmrLoadingDelay** and select the **OnTimerEnd** property.

1. If the app is opened via the adaptive card link, it should directly open the work item record that was updated, which means that we would need a way to check if a work item id is being passed to the app.

1. The Loading page formula needs to be updated to include the Work Item number, so we need to Update the **OnTimerEnd** property to the following:

    ```powerapps-dot
    If(
        gblAppLoaded,// && !IsBlankOrError(gblAppStyles),
        If(
            !IsBlank(Param("subEntityId")), //check if the parameter is blank or not
            If( //if the parameter is not blank, check if the user is on a mobile device or desktop/web and then populate the relevant variables and collections to make deep linking work
                (!IsBlank(Param("hostClientType")) && (Param("hostClientType") = "android" Or Param("hostClientType") = "ios")) || (IsBlank(Param("hostClientType")) && (Acceleration.X > 0 || Acceleration.Y > 0 || Acceleration.Z > 0)) Or tglAdmin_Mobile.Value, 
                //project cover colors
                ClearCollect(
                    colMobileProjectCoverColors,
                    {
                        Color: "#F4B9B9",
