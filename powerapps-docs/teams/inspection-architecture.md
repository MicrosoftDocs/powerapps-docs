# Understand Inspection sample apps architecture

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Inspection](inspection.md) app, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Inspection sample app instead, go to [Inspection sample apps](inspection.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](inspection.md) the Inspection sample app.

## Data model

The following diagram explains the data model used by the Inspection sample app.

![Inspection sample app data model.](media/inspection-architecture/data-model.png "Inspection sample app data model")

| Table name | Description |
| - | - |
| Area Inspection | An inspection is, most generally, an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. This table holds the inspection checklist results using the area inspection step when an inspection is performed using a checklist/form. |
| Area Inspection Step | An inspection step is one of the checklist item results of an inspection, and holds the outcome and notes of that particular inspection step. |
| Area Inspection Location | An inspection location is place or item or audit that the user needs to inspect. All the inspection steps are performed on this location or item. One inspection can have multiple inspection steps that depend on the number of checklist steps that are made available for the inspection. |
| Area Inspection Checklist | A checklist is a list of all the things that you need to do while inspecting. It holds multiple Checklist steps, and is connected to the type of the inspection. During the inspection, all the associated checklists are available to the user to choose and perform the inspection. |
| Area Inspection Checklist Step | Checklist steps are the steps that are performed in a sequential order while inspecting an item/area using a checklist. Each checklist step is associated to only one checklist. A series of checklist steps make one checklist. |
| Area Inspection Image | All the images that are taken or uploaded during the inspection are stored in this table, and these images are associated to area inspection steps. |
| Area Inspection Location | This table holds the information of the area, asset, or items that needs to be inspected. |
| Area Inspection Location Type | This table holds the type or category that the area, asset, or item is aligned to. Based on the type of area, asset, or item, the associated checklists are made available for the user to start the inspection. |
| User Setting | User settings are used to store user preferences pertaining to seeing the Power Apps splash screen every time they log in to the app. There is one record for each user. |
| User Setting | Team settings are used to store Team, Channel, and Planner preferences while using the application. |

### Architecture Model

The following diagram shows how users interact with systems and data in the Inspection app.

### Connectors

The following connectors are used in the Inspection app:

- **Microsoft Teams** - Used to post messages on channels for notifications.
- **Office 365 Users** - Used to read Microsoft 365 user profile data.
- **Microsoft Planner** - Used to create tasks.
