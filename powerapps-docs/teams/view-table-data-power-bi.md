# View Dataverse for Teams table data in Power BI Desktop (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use Power BI Desktop to view data from tables in Dataverse for Teams. This enables you to create sophisticated reports to analyze data from your Dataverse for Teams tables. This is possible using a new connector that can use direct query mode for real-time data while enforcing the Dataverse for Teams security model when accessing data. Additionally, the connector automatically maps relationships.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - This feature is enabled only for the Dataverse for Teams environments created with the General Availability release. Dataverse for Teams environments created during the Public Preview release will be enabled later.

## Prerequisites

You must have the appropriate Power BI [license](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-licensing-organization) to build and share Power BI reports.

## Step 1: Get the environment URL

Follow the steps to get the URL of your Dataverse for Teams environment, which is required to connect from the Power BI Desktop.

1. Start Teams, and sign in.

1. In the left pane, select **Power Apps**, and then select the **Build** tab.

1. Select the team in the left pane that contains the data you want to view in Power BI.
