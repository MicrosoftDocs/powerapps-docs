# Create additional apps from Teams

Creating the <!--- Add link to the first app page when ready -->first app inside a team using Power Apps app creates an environment. After an environment is available, you can create additional apps inside a team using several methods. Let’s take a look at several methods you can use to create an app.

## Create an app from Power Apps Home

Select **Create an app** from the Power Apps app to get started with creating an app.

When the team that you select already has an environment available, you’re not prompted about the need to install an environment. Instead, you can select **Create** to create the app.

> [!TIP]
> Creating a canvas app using different methods doesn’t affect the available app features. If you want to change the app orientation and size after you selected a layout, go to [change the screen size and orientation of a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/set-aspect-ratio-portrait-landscape.md).
