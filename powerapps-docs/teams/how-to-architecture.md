# Understand How to app sample app architecture (preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the How to app, and understand how to use them effectively.

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

## Data model
The following diagram shows the tables, columns, and relationships in the How to app solution:

![How to app sample app data model.](media/how-to-architecture/data-model.png "How to app sample app data model")

## Tables

| Table                      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Item Demo                  | How to app is designed to help new makers learn how to make Power Apps. This table is provided as an example of the table the users will create to store items that are available to be checked out. |
| Item Checkout Demo         | How to app is designed to help new makers learn how to make Power Apps. This table is provided as an example of the table that the users will create to store item checkout records. |
| Item Type Demo             | How to app is designed to help new makers learn how to make Power Apps. This table is provided as an example of the table that the users will create to store item types for classification of items. |
| Item Checkout  App Stage   | As the user goes through the lessons in the app, the app will store the status of their progress through the app, enabling the user to pick back up where they left off. |
| Item Checkout Instructions | The instructions for proceeding through the How to app are stored in the item checkout instructions table. |



## Architecture model
The following diagram illustrates the way that people, systems, and data interact in the How to app solution
