# Use sample apps from the Microsoft Teams store

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Sample apps that were created by using Power Apps are available in the Teams store. You can select the sample app that best fits your business requirement and quickly install it to get started. In this article, you'll learn about one such sample app that helps manage campaigns and ideas. Sample apps created with Power Apps and published to the Teams store can consist of multiple components such as apps, flows, and tables.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to search for a sample app in the Teams store and add it to your team channel. After you install the sample app, you can go to the team that you added the app to and use the tabs for the app just as you use other features such as **Post**, **Files**, or **Wiki**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing the sample app automatically enables the selected team's Microsoft 365 Group for security. More information: [Enable security for the selected team's Microsoft 365 Group](../maker/canvas-apps/share-app.md#share-an-app-with-office-365-groups)

## Available sample apps

Several sample apps are available from the Teams store that you can add to your Teams channels and use for different purposes.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| [Employee Ideas](employee-ideas.md) | Manager and employee apps for campaigns and ideas. |
| [Inspection](inspection.md) | Manager and user apps for area inspections. |
| [Issue Reporting](issue-reporting.md) | Manager and user apps for issue reporting. |

The following tutorial shows how to install the Employee Ideas app.

## Install the sample app

1. Select **Apps** at the bottom of the left pane in Teams.

1. Search for **Employee Ideas**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can keep **Post to the channel about this tab** selected to post an announcement
    to the channel that the app has been added. If you clear this check box, the addition of the app won't be announced.

1. Installation of the app begins. Installation might take a while; you can continue
    with other activities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If the selected Teams team doesn't already have an environment created, a new environment is created at this stage. More information: [Environment lifecycle](/power-platform/admin/about-teams-environment.md)
    > - Environment creation will fail if the Teams team that you selected has *Hiddenmembership* enabled. If this happens, try creating the app in a different team. More information: [Hidden membership groups](known-issues-limitations.md#hidden-membership-groups)

1. After the app is installed, you'll see a tab named **Employee Ideas** added to the team channel that you selected earlier.

Similarly, you can find other apps in the Teams store and add them to your team channel.

## Run the sample app

To run the installed app, select the **Employee Ideas** tab from the team channel.

### Step 1 - Allow connections

Before you can use the app, it might ask your permission to use connections.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of connections you see below is an example. The number and types of connections asking for your permissions may vary depending on the app you install.

![Select Allow to let the app use connections](media/sample-app-10.png "Select Allow to let the app use connections")

Select **Allow**, so the app can use connections.

### Step 2 - Select the channel

Select the channel (in this example, the channel is populated automatically), and then select **Let's go**.
