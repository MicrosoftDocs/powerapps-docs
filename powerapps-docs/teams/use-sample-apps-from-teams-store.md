# Use sample apps from Teams store

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Sample apps created using Power Apps are available in the Teams store. You can select the sample app that best fits your business requirement and quickly install to get started. In this article, you'll learn about one such sample application that helps inspect vehicles. Sample apps created using Power Apps and published to the Teams store may consist of multiple components such as apps, flows, and tables.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to search for sample apps in Teams store, and add them to your team channel. After you install the sample app, you can go to the team that you added the app to and use the tabs for the apps just like other features such as **Post**, **Files**, or **Wiki**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing the sample app automatically enables the selected team’s Microsoft 365 Group for security. For more information about Microsoft 365 Group and security, go to [enable security for the selected team’s Microsoft 365 Group](../maker/canvas-apps/share-app.md#share-an-app-with-office-365-groups).

## Available sample apps

Several sample apps are available from the Teams store that you can add to your Teams channels and use for different purposes.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| [Asset Inspection](asset-inspection.md) | Manager and user apps for asset inspections. |
| [Area Walk](area-walk.md) | Manager and user apps for area walks. |
| [Employee Ideas](employee-ideas.md) | Manager and employee apps for campaigns and ideas. |
| [Issue Reporting](issue-reporting.md) | Manager and user apps for issue reporting. |

The following tutorial shows how to install one of the available sample apps.

## Install the sample app

To get started with installing the sample Power Apps app in Teams:

1. Select **Apps** at the bottom of left pane inside Teams.

1. Search for the app name, for example **Asset Inspection**.

1. Select the app.

1. Select **Add to a team**.

1. Search for the Teams channel that you want to add the apps to.

1. Select **Save** to confirm and start the installation.

    ![Select save](media/sample-app-4.png "Select save")

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can keep **Post to the channel about this tab** selected to
    communicate the addition of the app. Unchecking will not announce the
    addition of the app on the selected channel as a post.

1. Installation of the app begins. Installation may take a while and you can continue
    with other activities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the selected Teams team doesn’t already have an environment created, a new environment is created at this stage. For more information about environment lifecycle, go to [Environment lifecycle](/power-platform/admin/about-teams-environment.md).

1. After the app installs, you’ll see tab(s) added to the Teams channel you selected earlier. In this example, the tabs are **Inspection App** and **Manage Asset Classes.** Upon completion of installation, you can remove the **Installing App** tab.

Similarly, you can find other apps in the Teams store, and add them to your Teams channel.

## Run the sample app

To run the installed app, select app from the available tabs inside the Teams channel that you added the app to.

For example, to run the **Inspection App**, select the app from the available
tabs on your Teams channel.

For more details about using the **Asset Inspection** app, go to [Asset Inspection](asset-inspection.md).

## Edit the sample app

You can further customize and edit the components of an installed Power Apps app in Teams. To edit and manage the installed Power Apps Teams app in Teams, go to [Manage your apps](manage-your-apps.md).

## Report installation errors

If you get any errors during the installation process, you can help us troubleshoot the problem much more effectively with the session details using CTRL+ALT+A on the keyboard. To learn more about the session details, go to [About tab](overview-of-the-power-apps-app.md#about-tab).
