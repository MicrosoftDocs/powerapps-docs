# Milestones sample app 

In this tutorial, you'll learn about configuring, and using the **Milestones** sample app.

## Overview

The Milestones sample app for Microsoft Teams provides a simple way to keep track of your projects and initiatives.

Benefits of using the Milestones app:

- Managers can easily set up projects, and work items.
- Assign work items to employees.
- Classify work items by milestones.
- Configure work item categories, priorities, and status options.

> [!NOTE]
> - Before you can use this app, you may be asked for your permissions to use the connection. More information: [Allow connections in sample apps](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md#step-1---allow-connections)
> - This app is available in three different Teams themes: Default, Dark and High contrast. When you [change the theme in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7), the app automatically updates to match the selected theme.
