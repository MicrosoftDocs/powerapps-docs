# Inspection sample apps

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this tutorial, learn about the Inspection (User) and Manage inspections (Manager) apps, and how to use them effectively.

## Overview

The Inspection solution for Microsoft Teams is a general inspection app that can be used
to inspect anything from a location&mdash;such as a retail store or manufacturing
plant&mdash;to assets and equipment, such as vehicles and machines. There are two apps in this solution, each intended for different kinds of users.

- [Manage inspections app](#manage-inspections-app) is used by a manager to perform the following actions:

    - View and close inspections.
    - Create and edit inspection forms.
    - View insights about inspection history.
    - Manage settings for Inspection app, such as Planner and Teams channel for messages.

- [Inspection app](#inspection-app) is used by employees to perform the following actions:

    - Inspect something, such as an asset or an area within a building or other location, in the course of completing their job. The app provides inspection checklists so that multiple locations can be inspected. For example, a store employee can use this app to inspect a section of a retail store to verify that the store is ready to open for the day.
    - Log an issue when an issue is found during the inspection and assign it to the right person so that it can be resolved quickly.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use this app, you may be asked for your permissions to use the connection. More information: [Allow connections in sample apps](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md#step-1---allow-connections)

## Prerequisites

Before using this app:

1. Find the app in Teams store.
2. Install the app.
3. Set up the app for the first use.

For details about the above steps, go to [Use sample apps from the Teams store](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md).

## Label setup

The labels describing the items being inspected and their associated types can
be modified in the **Manage inspections** app.

To change labels used in the app:

1. Sign in to Teams.

1. Select the team.

1. Select the **Manage inspections** tab in Teams.

1. Select ![App settings to customize experience](media/inspection/teams-settings.png "App settings to customize experience") from the upper-right corner.

1. Select **Customize experience** on the left pane.

1. Enter labels in the **Main section** field for the main category of items to be inspected such as assets, areas, or locations.

1. Enter labels in the **Secondary section** field for the secondary category of items such as type of assets, areas, or locations.

1. Select **Save** to save the changes to label setup.

    ![Customize experience](media/inspection/customize-experience.png "Customize experience")

## Manage inspections app

The Manage inspections app gives a manager the following capabilities:

- [Configure the app](#configure-the-app)
- [Edit the app configuration](#edit-the-app-configuration)
- [Add location types](#add-location-types)
- [Add locations](#add-locations)
- [Group locations](#group-locations)
- [Review submitted inspections](#review-submitted-inspections)
- [Review inspection insights](#review-inspection-insights)

> [!NOTE]
> For the example in this tutorial, the items being inspected are referred to as **Location** and **Location types**. This is based around a retail scenario where retail employees inspect sections of a store before opening or closing for the day. These views can differ based on how you've configured your application. For example, when inspecting a fleet of vehicles, the labels might be **Vehicle** and **Vehicle Category**.

### Configure the app

To configure the app:

1. Sign in to Teams.

1. Select the team.

1. Select the **Manage inspections** tab in Teams.

1. Configure or skip Planner integration:

    - If your Teams channel has a Planner tab, select **I've a planner tab**.
    - To continue app configuration without Planner integration, select **I'll set up later**.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Without Planer integration, the app will still work, but the tasks will not be created during the inspections.    
 
    - To set up the Planner tab first, go back to the Teams channel, set up the Planner tab, and reopen the **Manage inspections** tab.

        > [!TIP]
        > Give your Planner a distinct name, such as “Inspection tasks”. When you select the Planner instance later to configure the **Manage inspections** app, you'll be able to identify the right Planner based on this name. The list of Planner instances inside the app as options shows Planner names, and not the name on the Teams tab for the Planner.

    ![Planner integration](media/inspection/planner-tab.png "Planner integration")
