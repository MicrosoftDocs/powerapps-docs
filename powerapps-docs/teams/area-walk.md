# Area Walk

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this tutorial, learn about the **Area Walk** (User) and **Area Walk** (Manager) apps, and how to use them effectively.

## Overview

**Area Walk** consists of two different apps, one app for the users, and another app for the manager.

- [Area Walk (Manager) app](#area-walk-manager-app)

    This app is used by a manager to perform the following actions:

    - Configure area walk forms and define outcome
    - Gain visibility to inspection results and issue status.
    - Ensure that all identified issues have been addressed by the staff.
    - Identify repeat issues from prior area walks and analyze root cause and prevent them from happening in future.

- [Area Walk (User) app](#area-walk-user-app)

    This app is used by employees to perform the following actions:

    - Inspect an area within a building or other location in the course of
    completing their job. The app provides inspection checklists so that
    multiple areas can be inspected. For example, a store employee can use this app to inspect a section of a retail store to verify that the store is ready to open for the day.
    - When an issue is found during the inspection, the employee can log the issue and assign it to the right person so that it can be resolved quickly.

## Prerequisites

- Find the app in Teams store.
