# Understand Profile+ sample apps architecture (Preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Profile +](profile-app.md) app, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Inspection sample app instead, go to [Profile + sample apps](profile-app.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

-   [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
    
-   [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
    
-   [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
    
-   [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
    
-   [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](profile-app.md) the
Profile + sample app.
