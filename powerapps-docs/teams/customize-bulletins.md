# Customize the Bulletins app

The Bulletins sample app for Microsoft Teams is designed to be a complete app experience and allowing makers to easily extend it for their own purposes. In this article, we'll go over how to customize the Bulletins app for Power Apps in Teams.

Before you can customize the app, you must install it from the Teams store. You can get the app at <https://aka.ms/TeamsBulletins>.

Once the app is installed, you can then customize the app using the following steps:

## Open Power Apps app in Teams

1. Select **...** (ellipsis), and search for **Power Apps**.

   ![Search for Power Apps.](media/customize-bulletins/search-power-apps.png "Search for Power Apps")

1. The Power Apps app icon will now appear on the left pane.

1. Right-click on the **Power Apps** icon, and select **Pin** to pin the app to your Teams menu. Pinning will make it appear every time you open Microsoft Teams.

   ![Power Apps button.](media/customize-bulletins/power-apps-icon-left-navigation-menu.png "Power Apps button")

1. We recommend that you right-click on the Power Apps logo, and select **Pop out app** to open the app in a new window. This way, you won't lose your work when working at other places in Teams. The app now opens in Microsoft Teams.

1. Now that you've loaded the Power Apps app, select **Build**. This screen will show all the teams that have Power Apps installed in them.

1. Select the team in which you installed the Bulletins app.

1. Select **Installed apps** to show all apps installed in the Team. Bulletins solution includes two apps: **Bulletins** for users to view and bookmark communication, and **Manage bulletins** for managers to use to create Bulletins, FAQ’s, and links or contacts, and view metrics for bulletin read and bookmark statistics.

1. Select **See all** in the **Bulletins** tile.

    ![See all option on the Bulletins tile.](media/customize-bulletins/installed-apps-see-all-option.png "See all option on the Bulletins tile")

## Extend the Bulletins data model

If you're modifying or adding any fields to your app, you'll want to first update or add these columns in their Dataverse tables. In this section, we'll explore the data model for Bulletins and how to modify it in Power Apps in Teams. Below is the data model for Bulletins.

![Data model.](media/customize-bulletins/data-model.png "Data model")

Before modifying the fields, you need to first decide where the fields you want to add should go. What are the users doing when they should see or interact with these fields?

-   Bulletin table (msft_bulletin) is where bulletin data is stored.

-   Bulletin Bookmark (msft_bulletin_bookmark) records are created when a user bookmarks a bulletin.
    
-   Bulletin Category (msft_bulletin_category) is a lookup table for bulletin categories.
    
-   Bulletin Category Preference (msft_bulletin_categorypreference) stores the category sort and display preferences.
    
-   Bulletin Read Receipt (msft_bulletin_readreceipt) records are created when a user reads a bulletin record.
    
-   Bulletin FAQ (msft_bulletin_faq) stores FAQ records.

-   Bulletin FAQ Category (msft_bulletin_faqcategory) stores the categories for FAQs.
    
-   Bulletin Link (msft_bulletin_link) stores link data for links/contacts.

-   Bulletin Contact (msft_bulletin_contact) stores contact data for links/contacts.
    
-   Bulletin Link Category (msft_bulletin_linkcategory) stores categories for links and contacts.
    
-   Bulletin User Setting (msft_bulletin_usersetting) record stores user settings for Bulletins.

## Bulletins Screens

From the list of apps, chatbots, flows, and tables, select the **Bulletins** app.

## Common customization scenarios

In this section, we discuss common customization/extension scenarios for Bulletins, and where you would make these changes.

### Send an alert when a new FAQ is posted

For notifications when a new FAQ is published, use Power Automate flow running when a row is added to the Bulletin FAQ table.

### Add contact phone in Links and Contacts section

By default, contacts in Bulletins do not include phone number. Add a phone number column to the Bulletin Contacts table and add the phone number to the Contact Detail Screen and Mobile Contacts Screen. For more details see [Add contact phone in Links and Contacts](bulletins-contact-phone.md).

### Add **notify me** settings to a category

If users wanted to be notified when a new bulletin was posted in a category, you can create a flow to notify them when a new bulletin is posted. For more details see [Add notify me settings to category](bulletins-notify-me.md).

## Publish changes

When you're done making modifications to the apps, select **Save** to save your changes**.**

![Save button.](media/customize-bulletins/save-button.png "Save button")

-   To preview your changes, select **Preview**.
    -   The app will launch in preview mode, where you can test the user experience when running the app

    -   To exit preview mode, press **Escape** on your keyboard or select the **X** in the upper right corner

        ![Close button.](media/customize-bulletins/close-button.png "Close button")

-   To publish your app changes, select the **Publish to Teams**.
    
-   Publishing the app makes your changes visible to users of the app.

-   A dialog will open confirming that you want to publish.

    ![Confirm publishing to Teams.](media/customize-bulletins/confirm-publishing-to-teams.png "Confirm publishing to Teams")

-   To change app settings, such as icon and background color, select **Edit details**.

-   To publish the app, select **Next**.

-   On the next screen, confirm the channel you want the app to appear. You can add to other channels in the Team by selecting **+**.

    ![Add to Channel.](media/customize-bulletins/add-to-channel.png "Add to channel")

-   To complete publishing your changes, select **Save and close**.

## Customization considerations

Before modifying the Bulletins app, consider the following items:

-   Where are my table customizations? Columns and tables added by you'll go to **built by this team** section of the Power Apps app. You can also add new tables in the **See all** area.

    ![Select See all option to view objects built by the team.](media/customize-bulletins/list-of-items-built-by-the-team.png "Select See all option to view objects built by the team")

-   Changes made to an app will be added as a new version of the app. If you get a new version from store, your customizations won't be overridden. You'll get a new version that has the latest features, but the new version won't be published.

    For example, if you make changes to the Bulletins app, then you install the latest version from the Teams store, your urgent field will still be visible in the app after the upgrade.

    ![Add Bulletins app to a team.](media/customize-bulletins/bulletins-app-add-to-team.png "Add Bulletins app to a team")

    The updated version of the app is available from the version history of the app. 

    ![Bulletins app details.](media/customize-bulletins/bulletins-app-details.png "Bulletins app details")

    Selecting **Details** from the app list will display the versions of the app and allow you to publish the new version.

    ![App versions.](media/customize-bulletins/app-versions.png "App versions")

-   When customizing the app, pop out the Power Apps app in Teams so you don’t lose your changes when you navigate to other parts of Teams.
    
-   The app theming has been developed to support dark and high contrast mode in Teams. Changing the fill color of screens may break dark and high contrast modes.
