# Add hierarchy to inspection location

The Inspections sample app allows users to create and perform inspections in the app. There are three apps, one per persona to perform, manage, and review Inspections. The three apps are&mdash;Inspections, Manage Inspections and Review Inspections.

By default, the Inspections app is designed for a single store. But what if you perform inspections on multiple stores? You'll want to add a table for stores to the app and let the user select the store in which they are performing inspections so that you can track at which store the inspection was performed.

In this article, we'll learn how to update the app to add a hierarchy of stores so that inspections can be performed for different stores.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, we'd need the ability to log in into Microsoft Teams that will be available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and will also need to have the Inspections sample app for Teams installed. This app can be installed from <https://aka.ms/TeamsInspection>.

1. Select Inspections to open the app in Power Apps Studio.

### Add a new table called Store

1. Select **Add Column**, and enter the table name as "Store", type as "Lookup", and related table as "Store".

1. Select **Create**.

1. Select **Close**.

### Add a new screen with a Gallery of Stores

1. Select the Tree view from the left-pane.

1. Select **+ New** screen from the tree view.

1. Select blank layout.

1. Update the **Fill** property to `gblAppStyles.Background.Fill`.

1. Select **+ Insert** to add a gallery to the new screen.

1. Select **Stores** as the data source.

1. Rename the gallery to "StoresGallery".

1. Set the following properties for the gallery **StoresGallery**.

    | Property | Value |
    | - | - |
    | Template size | 108 |
    | Font size | 20 |
    | Height for Title4 | 45 |
    | Font size for label Subtitle4 | 18 |
    | Height for label Subtitle4 | 45 |

1. Go to the **Items** screen, and copy the **Back** button from the top of the screen.

1. Paste the copied button on the new screen.

1. Repeat the previous steps to copy the label **lblIndividualAreasHeader** from Items screen that reads the text as location to the new screen.

1. Set **Y** property of the label to `btnBackToHome_1.Y+btnBackToHome_1.Height`.

1. Set the following properties of the gallery **StoresGallery**.

    | Property | Value |
    | - | - |
    | Y | `btnBackToHome_1.Height+lblIndividualAreasHeader_1.Height` |
    | Height `Parent.Height-btnBackToHome_1.Height- lblIndividualAreasHeader_1.Height` |
    | OnSelect | `Set(gblSelectedStore,ThisItem);Navigate('Items Screen')` |

1. Go to the Items, select the **Back to home** button on top, and update the following button properties.

    | Property | Value |
    | - | - |
    | OnSelect | `Navigate(StoreSelectionScreen, ScreenTransition.Fade)` |
    | Text | `"Back to Store Selection"` |

1. Go to **Checklist Steps** screen.

1. Select the **OnSelect** property of the screen, and update the patch function for updating the **Area Inspections** app to add the store value in the formula.

   ```powerapps-dot
   Navigate(
   StoreSelectionScreen,
   ScreenTransition.Fade
   );
   ```

            ),
        Today(),
        Days
        ) = 1,
