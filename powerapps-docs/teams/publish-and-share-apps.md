# Publish and share your app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this article, learn about how you can publish and add apps to Microsoft Teams team.

## Publish and add an app to Teams

Whenever you save changes to a canvas app, you automatically publish them only for yourself and anyone else who has permissions to edit the app. When you finish making changes, you must explicitly publish them to make them available to everyone the app is shared with.

### Publish and add app to Teams channel from Power Apps Studio

To publish an app, select the **Publish to Teams** button from the top-right side of Power Apps Studio.

![Publish to teams](media/publish-app-5.png "Publish to teams")

Select **Next.** Publishing an app creates a new version of the app and makes the published version of the app available to everyone else the app is shared with.

![Select next](media/publish-app-6.png "Select next")

A list of all channels is displayed. You can add the app to one or more channels as a tab inside the team.

Select **+** to add the app as a tab and **Save.**

For more information about publishing an app and versions, go to [publish an app](../maker/canvas-apps/save-publish-app.md#publish-an-app).

### Add published app to Teams channel from Teams

You can add apps to your team’s channel directly using the **Add a tab** option if the app is published and shared with the team.

To add a published app to your team:

1. Select the channel that you want to add the app to.

1. Select ![Select plus icon](media/publish-app-9.png "Select plus icon")
   
    ![Select plus in teams channel](media/publish-app-10.png "Select plus in teams channel")

1. Select **Power Apps.**

   ![Select Power Apps](media/publish-app-11.png "Select Power Apps")

1. You can select the app that you want to add to the channel tab. The available apps by default show apps you’ve created, with the selected view as **My apps**.

   ![My Apps view](media/publish-app-12.png "My Apps view")

   If the app you’re looking for isn’t available in **My apps** view, select a
  different view.

   ![Select different view](media/publish-app-13.png "Select different view")

    -  **My apps** – published apps that you’ve created.

    -  **All apps** – all published apps that you have access to.

    -  **Sample apps** – sample app [templates](../maker/canvas-apps/get-started-test-drive.md) available in Power Apps by default.

    -  **Model driven apps** - all published model-driven apps shared with the selected team.

   You can also search for an app by the name.

   ![Search for an app](media/publish-app-14.png "Search for an app")

   When you select an app that you're an owner of, you’re prompted to ensure the app is shared with the team before you add it to the channel’s tab.

   ![App owner](media/publish-app-15.png "App owner")

1. Select **Save** and the app is added to your selected channel as a tab.

   ![Select save](media/publish-app-16.png "Select save")

You can now run the app inside the Teams channel and switch across posts, files, Wiki, and other options.

## Share an app

You can't share apps or data outside of a team currently. This capability is coming soon as a new **Share with your colleagues** experience.
