# Publish and share your app

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this article, learn about how you can publish and add apps to Microsoft Teams team.

## Publish and add an app to Teams

Whenever you save changes to a canvas app, you automatically publish them only for yourself and anyone else who has permissions to edit the app. When you finish making changes, you must explicitly publish them to make them available to everyone the app is shared with.

To publish an app, select the **Publish to Teams** button from the top-right side of Power Apps Studio.

Select **Next.** Publishing an app creates a new version of the app and makes the published version of the app available to everyone else the app is shared with.

A list of all channels is displayed. You can add the app to one or more channels as a tab in the team.

## Share an app

You can't share apps or data outside of a team currently. This capability is coming soon as a new **Share with your colleagues** experience.
