## Overview

The Perspectives sample app template for Microsoft Teams provides a simple way to add topics and extend the topics with Q&A where anyone in the organization can have a perspective about the topics, and have a discussion about them in Teams.

Benefits of using the Perspectives app:

-   Create discussions. 
-   Interact with colleagues.
-   Find interesting discussions.
-   Flag recommended discussions.

> - This app is available in three different Teams themes: Default, Dark and High contrast. When you [change the theme in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7), the app automatically updates to match the selected theme.
