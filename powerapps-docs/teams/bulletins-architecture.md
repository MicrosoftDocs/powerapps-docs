# Understand Bulletins sample app architecture

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Manage Bulletins](bulletins.md#manage-bulletins-app) and [Bulletins](bulletins.md#bulletins-app) apps, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Bulletins sample app instead, go to [Bulletins sample app](bulletins.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](bulletins.md) Bulletins sample app.

## Architecture model

The following diagram illustrates the way that users and systems interact with data in the Bulletins solution

### Connectors

The following connectors are used in the Bulletins app:

- **Microsoft Dataverse** - used to read and write data in Dataverse.
