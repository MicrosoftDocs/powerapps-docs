# Remove an app from your team

Removing an app added as a tab from a Teams channel makes it inaccessible from the Teams tab for all members of the Teams channel.

To remove an app from your team:

1. Go to the team that you have the app added to.

    ![Team](media/remove-apps-1.png "Team")

2. Select the drop-down for the tab.

    ![Select tab](media/remove-app-2.png "Select tab")

3. Select **Remove**.

4. Confirm **Remove**.

    ![Confrm removal](media/remove-app-confirm.png "Confrm removal")

The app is now removed from your Teams channel.
