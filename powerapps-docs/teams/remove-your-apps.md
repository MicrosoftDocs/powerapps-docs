# Remove an app from your team

Removing an app added as a tab from a Teams channel makes it inaccessible from the Teams tab for all members of the Teams channel.

To remove an app from your team:

1. Go to the team that you have the app added to.

    ![Remove-app-go-to-teams](media/remove-apps-go-to-teams.png "Remove-app-go-to-teams")

2. Select the drop-down for the tab.

    ![Remove-app-select-from-drop-down](media/remove-app-select-from-drop-down.png "Remove-app-select-from-drop-down")

3. Select **Remove**.

4. Confirm **Remove**.

    ![Remove-app-confirm](media/remove-app-confirm.png "Remove-app-confirm")

The app is now removed from your Teams channel.
