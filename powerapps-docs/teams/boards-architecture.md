# Understand Boards sample app architecture (Preview)

[This article is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by
the [Boards](boards.md) app, and understand how to
use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use
the Boards sample app instead, go to [Boards app](boards.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about
different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

-   [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
    
-   [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
    
-   [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
    
-   [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
    
-   [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](boards.md)
Boards sample app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>-   This is a preview feature.
>-   Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Architecture model

The following diagram illustrates the way that users and systems interact with
data in the Boards solution

### Connectors

The following connectors are used in the Boards app:

-   **Microsoft Dataverse** - used to read and write data in Dataverse.

-   **Office 365 Users** - used to read Microsoft 365 user profile data.

## Data model

The following diagram explains the data model used by the Boards sample app.
