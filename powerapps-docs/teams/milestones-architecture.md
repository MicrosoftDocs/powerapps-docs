# Understand Milestones sample app architecture

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Milestones](milestones.md) app, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Milestones sample app instead, go to [Milestones sample app](milestones.md).

## Prerequisites

To understand and use information in this article, you'll need to know about different controls, features, and capabilities of canvas apps.

- [Create and update a collection in a canvas app](../maker/canvas-apps/create-update-collection.md)
- [Collect, Clear, and ClearCollect functions in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)
- [Understand canvas-app variables in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-variables.md)
- [Add and configure a canvas-app control in Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-configure-controls.md)
- [Add a screen to a canvas app and navigate between screens](../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables.md)

You'll also need to know about how to [install](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md), and [use](milestones.md) Milestones sample app.

## Data Model

### Connectors

Milestones app uses the following connectors:

-   Microsoft Dataverse to read and write data to Dataverse tables.

-   Office 365 Users to read user profile data.

## Tables

Milestones app includes the following tables:

| Table name           | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Project              | A project denotes an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim. Details such as name, when and by whom was it created or modified are stored under the Projects entity. A single project can have multiple milestones, work items, team members and activities associated to it. |
| Project Milestone    | A Project Milestone is a task that depicts an important achievement in a<br>Project. Milestones should represent a sequence of events that incrementally<br>build up until a Project is complete.<br><br>Details such as name, the project to which it is associated to and the date<br>when the Milestone must be completed are stored under the Project Milestones<br>entity. A milestone can only be part of a single project but can have<br>multiple work items associated to it. |
| Project Work Item    | A work item indicates the type of work, what needs to be done and the date within which it must be completed. Details such as the name, description, to whom it has been assigned to, status, priority, and the target date define a work item. A work item can be a part of a single milestone and can have only one status, priority, category, and team member associated to it. It can, however, have multiple associated activities. |
| Project Status       | Status summarizes the overall status of a work item. Default status values include New, In Progress, Blocked and Completed. More statuses can be added from within the Settings section in the app. Each status has a name and an associated color. |
| Work Item Priorities | Priority represents the order of importance in which a work item must be completed when compared to the remaining work items. Default priorities include P0, P1, P2, and P3. More priorities can be added from within the Settings section in the app. Each priority has a name and an associated color. |
| Work Item Categories | Categories help in classifying work items. Default priorities include high, medium, and low. More categories can be added from within the Settings section in the app. Each category has a name and an associated color. |
| Project Team Members | Team Members are individuals who work on one or more work items in a Project. An individual who is part of multiple projects will have one team member record per project. |
| Project Activities   | Activities are used to provide updates made on work items of a project. A<br>single work item can have multiple activities. Activities get created as<br>work items are updated. An activity can also be created manually. |
| Project User Setting | User settings are used to store user preferences pertaining to seeing the Power Apps splash screen every time they log in to the app. There is one record for each user. |

#### OnStart execution details

1.  When a user accesses the app, **gblAppLoaded** is set to false. The user's
    language code is stored in **gblUserLanguage**, with English - US being the
    default one.

2.  The user's language is then used to collect localized text used throughout
    the app (for example, label and button text) in **colLocalization**.

3.  The user's Microsoft Teams theme/mode is checked to see if the theme is default, dark
    or high contrast. The **gblThemeDark** and **gblThemeHiCo** variables are
    set accordingly.

4.  The stock images and cover colors are collected in **colStockImages** and
    **colProjectCoverColors** respectively. **colProjectCoverColors** has two
    sets of 14 colors. For each base, there are two colors. One is for default
    theme and the other is for dark theme. For example, \#F4B9B9 is the default
    mode equivalent of \#791818.

5.  User details from Project User Settings table are collected in
    **colUserSettings**. If no records exist, a new project user setting record
    is created and the variable **gblFirstRun** is set to true. This in turn
    controls the visibility of the splash dialog. If there are multiple project
    user setting records exist, the oldest record is selected and stored in the
    **gblRecordUserSettings** variable.

## Loading Screen

This section explains app loading screen collections, variables, and execution details.

### Navigating to Projects Screen

#### Variables involved

The following variables are used when the loading screen navigates to the projects screen:

| **Variable name**      | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| gblAppLoaded           | Global variable to check if the app has loaded completely.   |
| gblAppStyles           | Global variable to store styling properties for all controls (set on the OnVisible of the Loading Screen). |
| gblAppContext          | Global variable to check the context of where the app is running. |
| gblFirstRun            | Global variable to check whether the app is being run for the first time. |
| gblRecordUserSettings  | Global variable to store the latest Project User Settings records for the current user. |
| locShowFirstRun        | Local variable to indicate if the current run of the app is the first run for the user. |
| locShowPowerAppsPrompt | Local variable to indicate if the user has set the preference to see the Power Apps prompt to yes or no. |

#### Project screen navigation execution details

1. If **gblAppLoaded** is true (which means the apps OnStart has completed),
   **gblAppStyles** is not blank (which means the styling variable has been
   loaded), and **gblAppContext** is true (which means the app is being
   accessed from within Teams), then the user is navigated to the:
   1.  Mobile projects screen if the hostClientType (device being used to
       access the app) is an Android or iOS.

   2. Projects screen if the hostClientType is not Android of iOS. Two
      variables are passed while navigating to the Projects Screen:

     -  **locShowFirstRun**: If the current run is the first run of the app
         as indicated by **gblFirstRun**, this is set to true, if not, then
         false.

     -  **locShowPowerAppsPrompt:** If the latest Project User Settings
          record for the current user (stored in **gblRecordUserSettings**)
          has a value of Yes for Display Splash (Power Apps) column, then this
          is set to true, if not, then false.

2.  If **gblAppContext** is false, then the user is navigated to the Incorrect
    Context Screen.

## First run experience

This section explains the app's [first time run](milestones.md#open-the-milestones-app) experience, relevant collections, variables, and execution details.

#### First run experience variables

The following variables are used to control the first run experience

| **Variable name**       | **Description**                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| locShowFirstRun         | Local variable to indicate if the current run of the app is the first run for the user. |
| locShowPowerAppsPrompt  | Local variable to indicate either to show or hide the splash screen.                    |

#### First run experience execution details

1.  When either **locShowFirstRun** or **locShowPowerAppsPrompt** is true, the
    container **conDialogWelcome** becomes visible.

2.  If **locShowFirstRun** is true, the container **conDialogFirstRun** becomes
    visible and gives an overview of the app.

3.  Select **Continue** sets **locShowFirstRun** to false that hides the
    **conDialogFirstRun** container. If **locShowPowerAppsPrompt** is true, the
    container **conDialogSplash_PowerApps** becomes visible showing the splash
    screen.

4.  Checking **Do not show again** and then selecting **Got it** updates the **Display Splash**
    **(PowerApps)** column in the **Project User Settings** record for the current user
    to **No**, which sets **locShowPowerAppsPrompt** to false in subsequent runs and
    hides the splash screen. Also, both **locShowPowerAppsPrompt** and
    **locShowFirstRun** are set to false so the user can continue with the app.

5.  Select **Got it** without checking the **Do not show again** checkbox simply sets
    both **locShowPowerAppsPrompt** and **locShowFirstRun** to false so the user
    can continue with the app. In subsequent runs, the splash screen is
    displayed to users until they check the Do not show again checkbox.

6.  The **All Projects** gallery  and work items will be visible once the
    user selects **continue**.

### Project Screen

This section explains the collections, variables, and execution details used in the project screen.

#### Viewing projects variables

The following variables are used when a user views projects in Milestones.

| **Variable name**     | **Description**                                                                          |

| locProjectSortOrder   | Local variable to control the sorting order of the list of projects.                     |
| locExpandProjectList  | Local variable used to control the visibility of the Project list (expand and collapse). |

#### Viewing projects execution details

1.  Projects are displayed in various screens of the app in various containers
    as mentioned below:

2.  **conProjectList** on the Projects Screen

3.  **conProjectList_About** on the About Screen

4.  **conProjectList_Settings** on the Settings Screen

5.  The galleries that list projects from the Projects table are:

    - **galProjects** on the Projects Screen

    - **galProjects_About** on the About Screen

    - **galProjects_Settings** on the Settings Screen

6.  Select a project sets the variable **gblProject** to the selected project
    and also collects the work items of the selected project in the
    **colWorkItems** collection.

7.  Select the + New project button on any of the above-mentioned screens updates
    the **locAddProject** variable to true and **locShowProjectTeamAssignment**
    variable (to learn about how this variable is used, go to Create a new
    project section) to false thus displaying the new project creation screen.

8.  The find projects text box is used to search for projects that contain the
    entered text in their name.

9.  Select the sort icon updates **locProjectSortOrder** which is used to sort
    the list of projects based on project name. Select the icon toggles the sort
    order from ascending to descending and vice versa.

10. Select the menu icon updates the **locExpandProjectList** variable by
    toggling its value from true to false and vice versa. This, in turn, expands, and collapses the project list section.

### Displaying and updating the project cover

This section explains the variables and execution details used when viewing or updating the cover image of a project.

#### Project cover update variables

The following variables are used when a user views or updates the project cover image.

| **Variable name**         | **Description**                                                                |

| locCustomImageSelected    | Local variable to check if a custom image was uploaded for project cover.      |

#### Project cover update execution details

1.  The project cover is part of the **conProjectHeader** container that
    displays the selected projects name, the cover image (if any) and
    cover color (if there's no cover image) which is fetched by using the
    **gblProject** variable.

2.  selectThe gallery **galProjectColors** presents the user with a list of
    colors based on the Microsoft Teams theme. This is achieved by filtering the
    **colProjectCoverColors** collection based on the Teams theme.

3.  If the selected project has a color defined, that color is denoted with a
    tick mark (**imgColorSelected**). The visibility of this icon is set to
    ThisItem.IsSelected. Because of the Default property of **galProjectColors**
    (described below), the selected projects cover color is selected by default.

4.  The default property of the gallery **galProjectColors** is used to select
    the cover color of **gblProject**. It is set as follows:
    1.  If the Teams theme is dark, Cover Color Dark of **gblProject** is looked
        up. If this is blank, it means there's no project cover color.
    
    2.  If the Teams theme is not dark, Cover Color of **gblProject** is looked
        up. If this is blank, it means there's no project cover color.
    
5.  Selecting a color sets **locCoverImageSelected** to false,
    **locCoverColorSelected** to true, and **locCoverChanged** to true.

6.  The gallery **galProjectCovers** displays a list of stock project cover
    images. It also allows users to upload a custom image using an add picture
    control (**addProjectCoverImage**).

7.  Selecting a custom image sets **locCoverChanged** to true and
    **locCustomImageSelected** to true.

8.  Selecting a stock image sets **locCoverImageSelected** to true,
    **locCoverColorSelected** to false, **locCoverChanged** to true, and
    **locCustomImageSelected** to true.

9.  If the selected project has one of the stock images as its cover, that stock
    image is highlighted by setting the fill color of
    **btnProjectCoverBackground**.

10. Select Done updates the project cover in the following way:

    -  If **locCoverImageSelected** is true and **locCustomImageSelected** is
        also true, it means that a custom image was selected by the user. So,
        Cover Photo is updated with the uploaded image and Cover Icon, Cover
        Color, Cover Color Dark are all set to blank.

    -   If **locCoverImageSelected** is true and **locCustomImageSelected** is
        false, it means that a stock image was selected by the user. So, Cover
        Icon is updated with the stock image and Cover Photo, Cover Color, Cover
        Color Dark are all set to blank.

    -   If **locCoverColorSelected** is true, it means that a cover color was
        selected by the user. So, Cover Photo and Cover Icon are both set to
        blank. The Cover Color and Cover Color Dark are updated per the
        following logic:

        1.  If the current Teams theme is dark, the color selected from
            **galProjectColors** is set as Cover Color Dark. If the current
            Teams theme is not dark, the color selected from
            **galProjectColors** is used to look up the corresponding dark mode
            color in **colProjectCoverColors** and this color is then set as
            Cover Color Dark. This is because if the Teams theme is not dark,
            **galProjectColors** is populated with default theme colors.

        2.  If the current Teams theme is not dark, the color selected from
            **galProjectColors** is set as Cover Color. If the current Teams
            theme is dark, the color selected from **galProjectColors** is used
            to look up the corresponding default mode color in
            **colProjectCoverColors** and this color is then set as Cover Color.
            This is because if the Teams theme is dark, **galProjectColors** is
            populated with dark theme colors.

### Displaying milestone/team status

This section explains the collections, variables, and execution details used when viewing milestone and status data

#### Milestone display collections

The following collection is used when viewing milestones.

| **Collection name**  | **Description**                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| colWorkItemStatuses  | - collection of work item statuses. |

#### Milestone display variables

The following variables are used when viewing milestones.

| **Variable name**            | **Description**                                                           |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| locShowProjectStatusOptions  | Used to control the visibility of the Project Status option gallery.      |
| locProjectStatusSelection    | Local variable to check what selection has been made by the user.         |
| locCompletionStatus          | Local variable to store the status that pertains to work item completion. |

#### Milestone display execution details

1.  There are four project status options available:

2.  Team Status that shows the list of team members along with the number of
    work items assigned to them based on their statuses.

3.  Milestone Status that shows the list of milestones along with the number of
    work items related to them based on their statuses.

4.  The items property of the **galMilestones** gallery is set to the milestones
    of the selected project **gblProject**.

5.  There are 13 images in the app used to denote different milestone percentage
    completions (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99, 100). The
    appropriate image is shown based on the percentage completion calculated by
    dividing number of work items for the milestone in Done status (which is the
    first status in **colWorkItemStatuses**, stored in **locCompletionStatus** in
    the OnVisible of Projects Screen) by the total number of work items for that
    milestone.

6.  The four labels under the milestone name display the count of work items in the first four statuses from **colWorkItemStatuses**.
    
7.  The items property of the **galTeamMembers** gallery is set to the Project
    Team members of the selected project **gblProject**.

8.  The user photo for each team member is displayed using
    Office365Users.UserPhotoV2 function. If there's no photo, a person icon is shown by default.
    
9.  The down arrow button next to the option label is used toggle between the Team Status and Milestone Status options. Select the arrow updates the value of **locShowProjectStatusOptions** variable toggling the value from true to false and vice versa controlling the visibility of the
    **galProjectStatusOptions** gallery.

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| gblProject             | Global variable to store the selected project.                                                                    |
| locSortWorkItemBy      | Local variable to define the sort by column.                                                                      |
| locWorkItemSortOrder   | Local variable to define the sort order.                                                                          |
| locShowSearchWorkItem  | Local variable to control visibility of work item search box.                                                     |
| locFilterWorkItems     | Local variable to control visibility of work item filter dialog.                                                  |

| locBackNavigation      | Local variable to capture if navigation to Projects Screen is by going back from About Screen or Settings Screen. |

#### Work item display execution details

1.  Select a project in the projects gallery results in two things (these are
    defined in the OnSelect of **galProjects**):

    -   First, the selected project gets stored in **gblProject**.

    -   Second, all Project Work Items that look up to this project get added to
        a collection **colWorkItems**.

2.  The above steps also happen in the OnVisible of the Project Screen so that
    the list of work items for the first project in **galProjects** is displayed
    without the need to select on the project when a user is navigated to the
    Projects Screen for the first time. Loading of work items does not happen in
    subsequent navigation to the Projects Screen by going back from About
    Screen or Settings Screen. This is controlled by **locBackNavigation**.

3.  The default sort by column (**locSortWorkItemBy**) is set to **eta**
    (Target) and the default sort order (**locWorkItemSortOrder**) is set to
    true (that is, Ascending). These are set in the OnVisible property of the
    **Projects Screen**.

4.  There are 7 buttons that are headers for the work items gallery
    (**galWorkItems**) – Work Item, Milestone, Category, Priority, Assigned to,
    Target, and Status. Select any of these updates the **locSortWorkItemBy**
    variable to define the appropriate sort by column and also toggles the sort
    order from ascending to descending or vice versa by updating
    **locWorkItemSortOrder**.

5.  The sort order is indicated by a down arrow image (**imgSortWorkItem**).
    Based on the sort by column, its X position changes. This prevents using one
    image per header. Based on the sort order, its **ImageRotation** property
    changes. This prevents using one image for ascending order and one for
    descending order.

6.  The headers and their associated labels within the work items gallery have
    their visibility based on the width of the container width. For example, the
    visibility of the status header (**btnStatusSort**) is (Projects Screen.Size
    = ScreenSize.ExtraLarge \|\| Projects Screen.Size = ScreenSize.Large) &&
    Self.Width \> 75

7.  The labels for milestone, category, priority, and status within the work
    items gallery have their width set to a formula that allows the width of
    these labels to change based on their respective text.

8.  **imgWorkItemAssignedTo** shows the image of the team member to whom a work
    item is assigned to and **imgWorkItemAssignedToDefault** shows the default
    image if the team member to whom a work item is assigned to, does not have
    an image

9.  Select the search icon sets **locShowSearchWorkItem** to true. This makes
    the search box and an X icon visible. Typing in the search box does a search
    on **colWorkItems** using the Name field. Select the X icon sets
    **locShowSearchWorkItem** to false and hides the search box.

10. Select the filter icon sets **locFilterWorkItems** to true to show the
    filter dialog and sets **locApplyFilter** to filter to not apply filters
    until the user has confirmed.

11. **conFilterWorkItems** is the container that has all controls used for
    filtering the gallery of work items. There are five combo boxes, one each for
    Milestones, Categories, Priorities, Team Members, and Statuses. They are all
    multi-select. Once the values have been selected, selecting **Apply** sets
    **locApplyFilter** to true which in turn filters the work items gallery.

### Deleting work items

    value of the checkbox within the gallery to **chkSelectAllWorkItems.Value**.

2.  The Reset property of the checkbox within the gallery is set to
    **locResetWorkItemCheckbox**. This variable is used to clear the checkbox
    when the user decides to cancel the deletion or when the user selects a
    project from the projects gallery.

3.  The delete icon remains disabled until at least one work item is selected.
    Once enabled, select the **delete** icon sets **locDeleteWorkItems** to true that makes the delete work item dialog visible.

4.  On the delete dialog, select **I understand** checkbox enables the delete
    button. The delete button first collects all items from the gallery that
    have the checkbox checked into a collection **colRemoveWorkItems**. Then
    **colRemoveWorkItems** is used to delete all the selected work items. And
    finally, **colWorkItems** is populated again with the list of work items
    related to the selected project (**gblProject**).

        color selected by the user. The Color Dark column is updated with
        the color selected by the user.

    2.  If the current Teams theme is default, the default mode colors are
        presented to the user. So, Color column is updated with the color
        selected by the user. The Color Dark column is updated by doing a lookup
