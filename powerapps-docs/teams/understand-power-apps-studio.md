the screen to update the background using the [RGBA function](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-colors.md).

![Formula bar](media/studio-formula-bar.png "Formula bar")

The formula bar is IntelliSense enabled. IntelliSense provides tips as you enter text inside the formula bar to help you with the function syntax. If a formula returns an error, the IntelliSense also shows tips relevant to the syntax error and mitigation steps. When you start entering text that matches to one or more functions, the formula bar shows in-line function help and highlights help text relevant to the cursor position.

![Function inside formula bar](media/studio-function-1.png "Function inside formula bar")

Similarly, use the IntelliSense when working with complex functions, nested
functions, or when correcting a formula syntax.

For a quick and easy function reference, you can also select the formula
drop-down.

![Function drop-down](media/studio-function-2.png "Function drop-down")

Select an event type from the drop-down at the top of the dialog, such as

![Change in function drop-down event selection](media/studio-function-4.png "Change in function drop-down event selection")

The available functions for the selected event type are dynamically updated
depending on the object you select. For example, if you selected a button on the
canvas, the available **Action** functions also include function
*ClearCollect()*.

![Function ClearCollect() selected](media/studio-function-5.png "Function ClearCollect() selected")

You can read the description of the selected **Action** function and selecting
the function name twice adds the function into the formula bar.

For a complete list of all canvas app functions, go to [Formula
reference](../maker/canvas-apps/formula-reference.md).

##### Edit existing table

Once you add rows, columns and add data, you can close the table and use it as
the data source inside your app. To edit content inside the table, you can use
the app controls, or go back to the Table designer to edit the table.

To edit the table, select the table data source and then select **Edit data** to
open the table inside Table designer.

![Edit table data](media/studio-edit-2.png "Edit table data")

After you close the Table designer, the data source is automatically refreshed
to reflect the updated data inside Power Apps Studio. You can also select **Refresh**
to manually refresh Power Apps Studio to reflect the data inside the controls added on the canvas.

### Media

Use the **Media** option to add images, video, or audio files to your app. Adding media directly to your app uploads the files to the app and uses the app storage. Each file uploaded to the app as media can’t exceed 64 MB and the size of all media files uploaded to an app can’t exceed 200 MB.

![Media](media/studio-media.png "Media")

If you want to reference additional media, consider using [audio and video controls with URLs](../maker/canvas-apps/add-images-pictures-audio-video.md#add-images-audio-or-video-using-the-controls),
using media from the [Azure Media Services](../maker/canvas-apps/add-images-pictures-audio-video.md#add-media-from-azure-media-services),
or from [Microsoft Stream](../maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-stream-video.md#example).
For more details about **Media**, go to [add multimedia files to Power Apps](../maker/canvas-apps/add-images-pictures-audio-video.md).

### Advanced tools

Go to **Advanced tools** to work with the canvas app **Monitor** and the **Test Studio**. Canvas app **Monitor** is useful when debugging a canvas app, or when
diagnosing a problem with the app – such as to investigate performance degradation or time delay when using the app. **Test Studio** allows you to
develop and reuse tests specific to individual apps based on scenarios. These tests can be useful when automating canvas app testing during application lifecycle management (ALM) scenarios, such as when releasing a new version of the app.

![Advanced tools](media/studio-advanced-tools.png "Advanced tools")

For more information about Monitor and Test Studio, go to [debugging an app with canvas app Monitor](../maker/canvas-apps/monitor.md) and [Canvas app Test Studio](../maker/canvas-apps/test-studio.md).

## 9 – Canvas/screen

The canvas shows the currently selected screen from the left pane.

## 10 – Properties pane

The properties pane shows properties and options available for the currently
selected object on the canvas. **Properties** tab shows generic options, such as the name, color, size, or position. **Advanced** tab shows additional options for advanced customization. The advanced properties may sometimes be locked for editing, such as when working with data cards. You can select [Unlock to change properties](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-cards.md#unlock-a-card) in such situations while working with advanced customization.

![Properties pane](media/studio-properties-pane.png "Properties pane")

## 11 – Screen selector

Use the screen selector to switch between screens when your canvas app has multiple screens. You can also select a screen from the left pane using the
**Tree view**. If the current selection is inside a container, or an individual cell inside a gallery, the selector shows the breadcrumbs for the parent elements at each level.

## 12 – Change canvas screen size

You can zoom in or zoom out while authoring the canvas app. Use **Ctrl+0**
keyboard combination or select the **Fit to window** to fit the screen size
based on current authoring window size. Note the zoom or screen size while
authoring a canvas app has no impact on the aspect ratio configured for the app when you preview your app or play a published app.
