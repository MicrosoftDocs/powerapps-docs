Benefits of using the Boards app:

-   Pin relevant information in one place.
-   Organize pins by topic.
-   Discover items pinned by colleagues.

When you [change the theme in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7), the app automatically updates to match the selected theme.
