# Integrate with Microsoft Planner

In this article, we'll learn how to integrate Power Apps with Planner to create and assign tasks to users within the organization.

Power Apps in Microsoft Teams enables collaboration between people and groups. Employees already use Teams to work, communicate, and collaborate. Apps in Teams have deep integration with other Teams capabilities. For example, in Teams, you can assign tasks to team members using Planner in your Teams channel. Apps that require follow-up by others in your team, such as to address issues reported in the Issue Reporting app, can leverage Planner in the Teams channel and create Tasks where users already manage their tasks.

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, we'd need the ability to create apps within Teams that will be available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions. We'll also need the ability to connect to Planner.

## Login into Teams

Login into Teams using either the Desktop app or the web app.

## Create a new Team

In this section, we'll create a new Teams team and then create an app within that team. Skip this section if you already have a team that you want to use instead.

1. To create a new team, select the **Teams** tab > select **Join or create a team** > select **Create Team** > select **From Scratch** > select **Public**, and give the team a name such as "Planner Integration". And then, select **Create**.

1. Select and add any members in your organization that you'd like to add to the team for testing purposes, and select **Add**.

1. Select **Close**.

    The new team gets created and is listed under the Teams tab.

## Create a new app

We'll create an app with five fields capturing details that will be used to create a Task in Planner.

1. Open Teams.

1. Select Power Apps from the left-pane.

1. Select **+ New app** under **Recent apps**.

1. Select the team created earlier, and select **Create** to open Power Apps Studio.

1. Enter a name for the app, such as "Integrate with Planner", and select **Save**.

    The app shows a default gallery

1. Select the database option from the left-pane to connect to the Planner.

1. Select **+ Add data**, and then select **Connectors**.

1. Enter "Planner" in the search box to look for the Planner connector.

1. Select **Planner**.

1. If prompted, sign in.

    Planner gets added as a data connection to the app

1. Select to open the Tree view.

1. Select **+ New screen** > **Blank layout**.

1. Add the following controls.

        Title.Value,
        {
            startDateTime: FromDate.Value,

            assignments: AssignedTo.Selected.'User Name'
        }
    )
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Upon selecting the **Create Task** button, it'll use the parameters provided in the formula to figure out the team for which the task is being created, the planner within the team the task is to be created, the Title from the text box captured on the screen, and the From and Due dates captured on the screen.

1. Move **Screen2** up above **Screen1**. If you want, you can also delete **Screen1** instead.

## Save and publish the app

1. Select **Save** on the top-right side of the screen to save the app.

1. Select **Publish**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Under **Add to Channel**, make sure the channel under which the app should be shown is listed and shows as at least "1 active tab(s)" and not "0 active tab(s)".

    ![Save and publish the App](media/integrate-with-planner/save-and-publish-the-app-1.png "Save and publish the app")

1. Select **Save and Close**.

## Test the app

1. Open the team under which the app is created.

1. Select **+ Add a tab**.

1. Search for tasks by Planner to add a planner tab to the team.

1. Enter tab name under **Create a new plan**, for example "Tasks Integration". And then, select **Save**.

    The tab gets added to the Team

    ![Testing the app](media/integrate-with-planner/testing-the-app-1.png)

1. Run the app in preview mode or from within the team.

1. Populate the columns with appropriate values.

    ![Populate the fields](media/integrate-with-planner/testing-the-app-2.png "Populate the columns")

1. Select **Create Task**.

1. Go to the Planner tab for which the task is being created&mdash;in our example, "Tasks Integration Planner".

    A new task with the details should be added to the list.

    ![Task is created](media/integrate-with-planner/testing-the-app-3.png "Task is created")

## See Planner integration in action

To see an example of Planner integration, check out the [Issue Reporting](issue-reporting.md) sample app template for Teams. Issue Reporting makes it easy for users to report issues. These issues are created in Planner and assigned for follow-up.

This integration can be easily extended to add logic to automatically assign the Planner Tasks or [provide notifications for issue tasks](extend-issue-sign-up-notification.md).
