## Understanding the Get connected interface (Teams)

Get connected is all about making connections with your colleagues. The Get connected app gives you easy access to details about the skills of your colleagues, and enables discovering and meeting new friends, connections with peers, and connection with an expert based on their skills. You can connect randomly to meet and learn new things from each other, or meet with an expert to learn how to overcome challenges, and connect peers with others who will have similar skills form a group to understand challenges and overcome them together.
