# Add tag to mark prioritized ideas

The Employee Ideas sample app for Microsoft Teams provides a platform for employees to submit ideas for various campaigns (that is, categories for grouping ideas around common themes).

With the Ideas app, managers can set up campaigns, users can submit ideas, view other users’ ideas, and also vote for ideas that they like the best. The experience can be customized by the admin or managers by editing campaigns, specifying justification questions that need to be answered by people submitting the ideas and also specify date threshold between which the campaign would be open for submitting ideas. The app also includes insights about who is submitting the greatest number of ideas and the most popular ideas during the week.

But once the ideas have been submitted and the voting period is over, how should a manager prioritize which ideas to act upon? You might prioritize those ideas with the most votes, or the ideas that are most aligned with your business goals and initiatives. After you determine your prioritization logic, you'll need a way to flag the ideas that are priority.

In this article, we'll learn how to add a **Priority** tag to an idea in the Manage Idea app so that the manager can tag prioritized ideas. We'll also add a label on the idea in the Ideas app to indicate if it was a prioritized idea or not. When done, the manager will be able to mark prioritized ideas in the Manage Ideas app, and users of the ideas app will be able to see that their idea has been prioritized.
