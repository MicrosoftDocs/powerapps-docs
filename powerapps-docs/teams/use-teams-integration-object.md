# Microsoft Teams integration object

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use the Teams integration object to easily find and access the Teams integration features and use the improved usability of expressions while integrating your canvas app with Teams. The availability of a *Teams integration object* can be validated by checking the presence of **Teams** control from the tree view.

There are two features available with the integration of Power Apps with Teams. You can get a Teams theme inside a canvas app, and you can filter data depending on the team or channel context.

## Get the Teams theme

Teams uses three themes: *Default*, *Dark*, and *High contrast.* When using the expressions to retrieve theme names, you can use the names as *Default*, *Dark*, and *Contrast* in the Power Apps formula bar. More information: [UI components: Colors](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/components/color)

To retrieve a theme name, use the following formula.

```powerapps-dot
Switch(
    Teams.Theme.Name,
    TeamsTheme.Default,
    Color.DimGrey,
    TeamsTheme.Dark,
    Color.White,
    TeamsTheme.Contrast,
    Color.Black
    )
```

In the above formula, the expression *Teams.Theme.Name* is used to evaluate theme names of *Default*, *Dark*, or *Contrast* and the color of the selected
canvas app object is changed depending on the color entered in the formula.

The [Switch() function](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-if.md) evaluates a formula and determines whether the result matches any value in a sequence that you specify.

![Function Switch()](media/teams-2.png "Function Switch()")

This function results in changing the background of canvas app, depending on the change in the theme selection in Teams.

![Teams themes](media/teams-themes.png "Teams themes")

| **Teams theme**                               | **App background**                       |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| *Default (App background color: DimGrey)*     | ![Default theme](media/teams-default-theme.png "Default theme") |
| *Dark (App background color: White)*          | ![Dark theme](media/teams-dark-theme.png "Dark theme") |
| *High contrast (App background color: Black)* | ![High contrast theme](media/teams-high-contrast.png "High contrast theme") |

## Get the Teams channel name to filter app data

You can get the Teams channel name in canvas app functions, such as [function Filter()](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup.md). To get a Teams channel name, use the following syntax:

```powerapps-dot
Teams.ThisChannel.DisplayName
```

For example, you can add a label and set the *Text* property to display the name of the Teams channel.

![Show the Teams channel name](media/teams-3.png "Show the Teams channel name")

For example, [connecting to a list hosted on a SharePoint site](../maker/canvas-apps/connections/connection-sharepoint-online.md), you can list the items in a default gallery.

![Show SharePoint list items](media/teams-4.png "Show SharePoint list items")

The list shows all items and a column representing the Teams channel name.

![All items](media/teams-5.png "All items")

Considering the Teams channel name as *General*, you can use the following formula to filter the gallery content depending on the name of the channel.

*Filter('Colors', Channel = Teams.ThisChannel.DisplayName)*

![Filtered items](media/teams-filtered-items.png "Filtered items")

For more information about the Teams client SDK, go to [Context interface](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams.context?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true). For more information about using context from Teams, go to [Use context from teams](../maker/canvas-apps/embed-teams-app.md#use-context-from-teams).
