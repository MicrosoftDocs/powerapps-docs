# Create an app from a list in Microsoft Teams

You can create an app from within a [list in a Microsoft Teams channel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-in-a-teams-channel-7d2538c0-0177-4dcc-8e4c-44d218fc5a85).

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about the **Lists** app in Teams, go to [Overview of the Lists app in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/manage-lists-app#overview-of-lists).

1. [Create a list in a Teams channel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-list-in-a-teams-channel-7d2538c0-0177-4dcc-8e4c-44d218fc5a85).
