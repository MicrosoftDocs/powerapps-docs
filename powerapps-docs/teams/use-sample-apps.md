The following tutorial shows how to install the Employee ideas app. You can use similar steps to install other sample app templates.

## Install the sample app template

To learn about installing sample app templates, go to https://github.com/microsoft/teams-powerapps-app-templates.

> [!NOTE]
> - Installing sample app templates automatically enables the selected team's Microsoft 365 Group for security. More information: [Enable security for the selected team's Microsoft 365 Group](../maker/canvas-apps/share-app.md#share-an-app-with-microsoft-365-groups)
> - If you can't upload or install uploaded sample app templates, check your [app permission policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies).

## Run the sample app template

To run the installed app, select the app's tab from the team channel. In this example, we'll use **Employee ideas**.

### Step 1 - Allow connections

Before you can use the app, it might ask your permission to use connections.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of connections you see below is an example. The number and types of connections asking for your permissions may vary depending on the app you install.

![Select Allow to let the app use connections.](media/sample-app-10.png "Select Allow to let the app use connections")

Select **Allow**, so the app can use connections.

### Step 2 - Select the channel

Select the channel (in this example, the channel is populated automatically), and then select **Let's go**.

![Select Let's go.](media/sample-app-11.png "Select Let's go")

### Step 3 - Use the app

The **Employee ideas** app is now open and ready for your use.

![Select app from available list.](media/sample-app-12.png "Select app from available list")

For more details about using the **Employee ideas** app, go to [Employee ideas](employee-ideas.md).

## Edit the sample app template

You can further customize and edit the components of an installed Power Apps app in Teams. More information: [Manage your apps](manage-your-apps.md)

## Report installation errors

If you get any errors during the installation process, you can help us troubleshoot the problem much more effectively by selecting **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**A** on the keyboard to get the session details. For more information about session details, go to [About tab](overview-of-the-power-apps-app.md#about).

For issues related to the sample app templates, report an issue at https://github.com/microsoft/teams-powerapps-app-templates.

## Sample app template updates

Updates to the sample app templates are published immediately. If you already have a sample app template in use when this happens, a new version of the app is created with these updates and published as the live version. If you [customized a sample app](customize-sample-apps.md), you can [restore the app to a previous version](manage-your-apps.md#restore-an-app) with your customizations, or recreate the customizations on top of the updated live version. When restoring the app to preserve your customizations, ensure to check the app functionality for compatibility with the updates.
