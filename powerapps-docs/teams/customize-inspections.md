# Customize the Inspection app

The Inspection sample app for Microsoft Teams is designed to be a complete app experience but allow makers to easily extend it for their own purposes. In this article, we'll go over how to customize the Inspection app using Power Apps in Teams.

Watch this video to learn how to customize the Inspection app:
> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWLn9E]

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can customize the app:
> 1. You must install it from the Teams store. You can get the app at <https://aka.ms/TeamsInspection>.
> 1. Ensure you review and understand the [customization considerations](#customization-considerations).

Once the app is installed, you can then customize the app using the following steps.

## Open Power Apps app in Teams

1. In Teams, select **…** (ellipsis) from the left-pane.

1. Search for and select **Power Apps**.

    ![Search for Power Apps](media/customize-inspections/search_powerapps.png "Search for Power Apps")

1. Right-click on **Power Apps**, and select **Pin** to lock the app to the left-pane so it's easy to locate the app later.

    ![Power Apps Icon](media/customize-inspections/power-apps-icon.png "Power Apps Icon")

1. We recommended that you “pop out” Power Apps so that if you need to go somewhere else in Teams, you won’t lose your app configuration. To pop out the Power Apps app, right-click on Power Apps, and select **Pop out app**.

1. Now that you've loaded the Power Apps app, select **Build**.

    ![Build Tab](media/customize-inspections/build-tab.png "Build Tab")

    This screen will show all the teams that have Power Apps installed in them.

1. Select the team in which you installed the Inspection app.

1. Select **Installed apps** to show all apps installed in the team.

    Inspection solution includes three apps&mdash;**Inspection** for users to use to complete inspections, **Review inspections** for supervisors to use to review and approve inspections, and **Manage inspections** for managers to use to analyze inspection history and create or modify inspection checklists.

1. Select **See more** in the **Inspection** tile.

    ![Inspection tile](media/customize-inspections/inspection-tile.png "Inspection Tile")

    You'll see all apps, tables, flows, and chatbots in the team.

    ![Inspection Objects](media/customize-inspections/inspection-app-details.png "Inspection Objects")

## Extend the Inspection data model

If you're modifying or adding any fields to your app, you'll want to first update or add these columns in their Dataverse tables. In this section, we'll explore the data model for Inspection app and how to modify it in Power Apps in Teams. Below is the data model for Inspection app.

![Inspections App Data Model](media/customize-inspections/data-model.png "Inspections App Data Model")

Before modifying the fields, you need to first decide where the fields you want to add should go. What are the users doing when they should see or interact with these fields?

To understand the Inspection data model, there are two primary table groups in Inspection&mdash;**checklist tables** and **inspection tables**. Checklist tables create a template for inspection form and related steps, and when a user completes an inspection, a copy of the checklist and checklist steps are copied to Area Inspection and Area Inspection Step.

**Checklist tables**

-   Area Inspection Checklist

-   Area Inspection Checklist Step

**Inspection tables**

-   Area Inspection

-   Area Inspection Step

**Other tables**

-   Area Inspection Location&mdash;what we are inspecting—can be a location, area, store, asset, or anything. Inspections are related to Area Inspection Location records.

-   Are Inspection Location Type&mdash;used to group and filter locations.

-   Area Inspection Image&mdash;stores images captured during the inspection.

## Inspection Screens

From the list of apps, chatbots, flows, and tables, select the **Inspection** app.

![Inspection Objects with Inspection highlighted](media/customize-inspections/inspection-objects-inspection-highlighted.png "Inspection Objects with Inspection highlighted")

Now that Inspection is open in Power Apps in Teams, select the **Tree View**.

![Inspection Tree View](media//customize-inspections/inspection-tree-view.png "Inspection Tree View")

From the Tree View, you can see the screens included in the app. Selecting the arrow to the left of a screen will expand the contents of the screen, giving you access to the components of the screen, including galleries, buttons, text labels, and text input controls.

The following are the screens in Inspection:

## Common customization scenarios

In this section, we'll discuss common customization/extension scenarios for Inspection, and where you would make these changes

### Add hierarchy to locations

The inspection app is designed for a single organization; however, if you have multiple sites and need to have your areas, equipment, or other inspection items filtered based on location, add a site or store table and link the inspections to the store.

### Add info about person being inspected

Some organizations use the Inspection app as a verification check on an employee—perhaps validation that a job was completed correctly, and if not, notify the manager of the user so they can provide coaching to the employee.

### Customize inspection steps

If you want to change inspection steps, such as removing tasks, images, or other capabilities, you can do so by updating the Inspection app **Inspection Checklist Screen** screen. For example, the add image button is in the checklist item gallery, and you can disable taking photos on inspections by  disabling the photo button.

## Publish changes

When you're done making modifications to the apps, select **Save** to save your changes.

![Save Changes](media/customize-inspections/save-changes.png "Save Changes")

- To preview your changes, select the **Preview**. The app launches in preview mode, where you can test the user experience when running the app. Press **Escape** on your keyboard or select the **X** in the upper-right corner when you're done with the preview.

    ![Top right corner X](media/customize-inspections/top-right-corner-x.png "Top right corner X")

- To publish your app changes, select **Publish to Teams**. Publishing the app makes your changes visible to users of the app. A dialog will open confirming that you want to publish.

    ![Confirm Publishing the App](media/customize-inspections/inspection-publish-confirm.png "Confirm Publishing the App")

- To change app settings, such as icon and background color, select **Edit details**.

- To publish the app, select **Next**.

- On the next screen, confirm the channel you want the app to appear. You can add to other channels in the Team by pressing the **+** button.

    ![Add to Channel](media/customize-inspections/add-to-channel.png "Add to Channel")

- To complete publishing your changes, select **Save and close**.

## Customization considerations

Before modifying the Inspection app, note the following considerations.

- Where are my table customizations?
  Columns and tables added by you'll go to **Built by this team** section of the Power Apps app. You can also add new tables in the **See all** area.

    ![Built by this team](media/customize-inspections/built-by-this-team.png "Built by this team")

- Changes made to an app will be added as a new version of the app. If you get a new version from store, your customizations won't be overridden. You'll get a new version that has the latest features, but the new version won't be published.

    ![Install new version](media/customize-inspections/install-new-version.png "Install new version")

    After upgrading the solution, your current app version will still be "Live". The updated version of the app is available from the version history of the app.
    
    ![Inspection App Details](media/customize-inspections/inspection-app-details.png "Inspection App Details")
    
    Selecting **Details** from the app list will display the versions of the app and allow you to publish the new version.
    
    ![Inspection Versions](media/customize-inspections/inspection-versions.png "Inspection Versions")
    
    You can choose to publish the new version or keep using the older one.

- When customizing the app, pop out the Power Apps app in Teams so you don’t lose your changes when you navigate to other parts of Teams.

- The app theming has been developed to support dark and high contrast mode in Teams. Changing the fill color of screens may break dark and high contrast modes
