# Add contact phone in links and contacts section

The Bulletins sample app for Microsoft Teams provides a central location for all company communication such as broadcasts, memos, announcements, and company news. The app allows you to create, categorize, bookmark, search and read bulletin posts.

The Bulletins app solution consists of two apps:

The Bulletins app solution consists of two apps:

[Manage bulletins app](bulletins.md#manage-bulletins-app)

-   Manager experience for managing **Bulletins** app.

-   Allows managers to create, edit, and categorize posts read through the Bulletins app.

[Bulletins app](bulletins.md#bulletins-app)

-   Central location for all company communication such as memos, broadcasts, and news.
    
-   Shows bulletins, FAQs, links, and contacts created using the **Manage bulletins** app.

In this article, we'll learn how to enable users to initiate a call to their contacts from within the app using Teams.

The Bulletins app provides links to relevant contacts in the organization and external to the organization that are relevant to specific categories. For example, if you want to know who is responsible for health insurance benefits, you can add the appropriate contact under the category of health insurance.

By default, there's no phone number to call the person. We'll add the ability to call the person from within the app.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you proceed, review [customize Bulletins app](customize-bulletins.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this lesson, we'd need the ability to login into Teams which will be available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions, and will also need to have the Bulletins app for Teams installed. This app can be installed from <https://aka.ms/TeamsBulletins>. Also, we'd need to complete [Add "notify me" settings to category](bulletins-notify-me.md). We'll use steps followed in that lesson and build up on those in this topic.

> [!NOTE]
> Follow below steps on both the Bulletins and the Manage Bulletins apps where you want the "Call contact" functionality enabled.

1. Open the **Bulletins** app.
1. Select **Insert** > **Media** from the left-pane.
1. Select **Upload** below the Search box and upload the image downloaded above.
