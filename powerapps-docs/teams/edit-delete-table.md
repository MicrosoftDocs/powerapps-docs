# Edit or delete a table
With Microsoft Dataflex, you can perform the following types of operations on a table:
- Edit the table columns
- Edit the table relationships
- Edit the table views
- Delete the table

## Edit a table

Within Teams, there are four table properties you can edit:

- **Display name**: The name you would like the table to use in all displays.
- **Plural display name**: The plural of the table name (when needed for display).
- **Description**: A brief description of the purpose of the table.
- **Quick create settings**: This enables quick creation of records for clients that support this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Each Dataflex environment is assigned a prefix upon creation, such as *cr1a3*. Every table and column name created will be prefixed with this value. This value can’t be changed.

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Tables**.
2. Open the table you want to edit. 
3. To modify the table properties, select **Settings** on the command bar to display the **Edit** table dialog box.

4. Make the changes you want, and then select **Done**.
 
## Delete a table
Anyone who is a member of the team can delete tables that aren’t part of a managed solution.

In the **Tables** list select **…** next to the table you want to delete, and then select **Delete table**. Alternatively, while viewing a table, select **Delete table** on the command bar.
