Overview
========

There are two Apps each intended for different kind of users. To use these apps,
users must find the app on the app store, install it for the team and set it up
for first use (add list of vehicles, customize inspection forms, set up contact
list etc.)

1.  Asset Inspection (User) App

    This app is used by an employee for the following:

-   To complete inspections effectively and efficiently so that the user can
    focus on their job and ensure that the asset or equipment is compliant with
    company standards.. For example, a delivery driver can deliver packages with
    confidence that the vehicle will not have any issues during their shift.

-   To document and notify managers about issues discovered during the
    inspection so that problems can be addressed in a timely manner.

1.  Asset Inspection (Manager) App

    This app is used by the manager for the following:

-   To ensure that assets and equipment are healthy and downtime won’t impact
    employee productivity.

-   Receive notification when an inspection is complete, along with any issues
    identified so that the manager can quickly resolve the issue.

-   Validate that assets and equipment meets safety standards.

-   Configure the app user experience, including adding, updating, or removing
    assets, creating and modifying inspection forms, and configuring inspection
    response outcome options.

-   View insights and metrics about completed inspection history.

>   For example, when manager is managing a fleet of vehicles, he wants to be
>   able to see recurring issues so we can address the root cause and improve
>   the efficiency of the organization.
