# Issue reporting sample apps

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In this tutorial, learn about the Manage Issues and Issue reporting apps, and how to use them effectively.

## Overview

Issue reporting consists of two different apps, one for reporting issues and another for managing them:

- [Manage Issues app](#manage-issues-app)

    The Manage Issues app is used by team managers to:

    - Configure the app experience, including the channel in which Microsoft Teams messages and Planner tasks are created by the app.
    - Create, review, edit, or delete issue template forms to collect information when a user reports an issue.
    - Review team issues, report on issue history, and efficiently manage issue resolution.

- [Issue reporting app](#issue-reporting-app)

    The Issue reporting app is used by employees to:

    - Log issues with the information required to resolve the issue.
    - Modify existing issues and assist with resolution
    - Get a high-level view of the issues and team issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use this app, you may be asked for your permissions to use the connection. More information: [Allow connections in sample apps](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md#step-1---allow-connections)

## Prerequisites

Before using this app:

1. Find the app in Teams store.
2. Install the app.
3. Set up the app for the first use.

You also need to [configure](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-planner-in-microsoft-teams-62798a9f-e8f7-4722-a700-27dd28a06ee0) Planner in Teams.

For details about the above steps, go to [Use sample apps from the Teams store](use-sample-apps-from-teams-store.md).

## Manage Issues app

This app provides the following capabilities:

- [Configure the app](#configure-the-app)
- [Edit the app configuration](#edit-the-app-configuration)
- [Add a new issue category](#add-a-new-issue-category)
- [Update a category icon](#update-a-category-icon)
- [Update a category title](#update-a-category-title)
- [Delete a category](#delete-a-category)

    > [!TIP]
    > Give your Planner a distinct name, such as “Issue tasks”. This way, you'll be able to identify the right Planner based on this name. The list of Planner instances inside the app as options shows Planner names, and not the name on the Teams tab for the Planner.

    > [!NOTE]

1. Select **Continue**.
