# Understand Employee ideas sample app architecture

In this article, you'll learn about the collections and global variables used by the [Employee ideas](employee-ideas.md) app, and understand how to use them effectively. If you want to learn more about how to install, and use the Employee ideas sample app instead, go to [Employee ideas](employee-ideas.md).
