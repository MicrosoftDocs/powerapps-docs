# What is PowerApps?

PowerApps is a suite of apps, services, connectors and data platform that provides a rapid application development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using PowerApps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your business data stored *either* in the underlying data platform ([Common Data Service](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro)) *or* in various online and on-premises data sources (SharePoint, Excel, Office 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on). 

Apps built using PowerApps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business processes to digital, automated processes. Further, apps built using PowerApps have a responsive design, and can run seamlessly in browser or on mobile devices (phone or tablet). PowerApps "democratizes" the custom business app building experience by enabling users to build feature-rich, custom business apps without writing code.

PowerApps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and metadata, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data.

For more information, see the [PowerApps channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGfWR2ekfRFckLjev6eQYLg) on YouTube.

## PowerApps for app makers/creators

Using PowerApps, you can create three types of apps: **canvas**, **model-driven**, and **portal**. More information: [Overview of creating apps in PowerApps](maker/index.md).

To create an app, you start with [web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com).

- **PowerApps Studio** is the app designer used for building canvas apps. The app designer makes creating apps feel more like building a slide deck in Microsoft PowerPoint. More information: [Generate an app from data](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/data-platform-create-app)  

- **App designer** for model-driven apps lets you define the sitemap and add components to build a model-driven app. More information: [Design model-driven apps using app designer](maker/model-driven-apps/design-custom-business-apps-using-app-designer.md)

## PowerApps for app users

You can run apps that you created, or that someone else created and shared with you, in browser or on mobile devices (phone or tablet). More information: [Find and run apps](user/index.md)

## PowerApps for admins

PowerApps admins can use:

- **PowerApps admin center** ([admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com)) to create and manage environments, users, roles, and data-loss prevention policies. 

- **Power Platform admin center** ([admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com)) to manage environments, get real-time, self-help recommendations and support for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, PowerApps, and Microsoft Flow, and view Common Data Service analytics. 

More information: [Administer PowerApps](/power-platform/admin/admin-guide)

## PowerApps for developers

Developers are app makers who can write code to extend business app creation and customization. Developers can use code to create data and metadata, apply server-side logic using Azure functions, plug-ins, and workflow extensions, apply client-side logic using JavaScript, integrate with external data using virtual entities and webhooks, build custom connectors, and embed apps into your website experiences to create integrated solutions. More information: [PowerApps for developers](/powerapps/#pivot=home&panel=developer)

## PowerApps and Dynamics 365

Dynamics 365 applications, like Dynamics 365 for Sales, Dynamics 365 for Service, Dynamics 365 for Marketing also use the underlying data platform (Common Data Service) used by PowerApps to store and secure data. This enables you to build apps using PowerApps and Common Data Service directly against your core business data already used within Dynamics 365 without the need for integration. More information: [Dynamics 365 and the Common Data Service](maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md#dynamics-365-and-the-common-data-service)

## Try PowerApps for free
